So we're switching to sweet peas! You're gonna love them. Look, mommy thinks they're so yummy. Very smart. Always make mommy try it first, okay? Oh, and there's your older brother PJ Doing today's homework at the last minute as usual. It's not today's homework. This is yesterday's homework. There's a chance you two will be in high school together. Oh, and there's dad preparing for another day's work. He kills bugs for a living. Honey, come on. we've been through this. I don't kill bugs. I'm a pest control specialist. Either way So now you've met the whole family. Forgetting somebody? Gabe! no no no. I didn't forget about you. I was just saving the best for last. Gharlie, that was your younger older brother Gabe. You want to say something to Charlie? You ruined my life. Okay, so it's taking Gabe a little bit longer To get used to you. You were kind of a surprise. I thought surprises were supposed to be good. And cut. Okay, gang, listen up.

Bob, you promised me you weren't gonna drop this one! Honey, look, it was just a little accident. Oh, and by the way, for the record-- an amazing catch! I knew this was a huge mistake. I never should've gone back to work. Sweetheart, this is all gonna be okay. No. no, it's not. It's too hard. I can't do this. I mean, what made me think I could go back to work full time and take care of four kids? I'm a terrible mother. No no, you're not. Look, if anything, I'm a horrible father. I know! Would you guys chill? You're great parents. Teddy, gabe and me turned out pretty good. Yeah, come on. We've got to be doing something right. I mean, hey, look at this-- our son's a doctor. I'm serious. With both of us working, Poor little Charlie doesn't stand a chance. Come on, no one's going solo on this. All us kids are gonna help out. And if charlie gets a little messed up along the way, We can all share the blame. Dr Chandrasooleewan to the operating room. It never ends! Gabe\NGabe! Sorry about that, Mrs Dabney, but you probably shouldn't let him in. I didn't let him in. He crawled through the cat door. Gabe, is there something you want to say to Mrs Dabney? Yeah. What are you fixing tomorrow night? The cat door. Gonna make sure it's locked. Okay. I think we're done here. - Good night. - It is now. All right, let's go. - What are you doing? - Oh, so now you're suddenly - interested in me? - gabe, you're my little brother. I've never been interested in you. I'm kidding. What's going on? Ever since the baby arrived, Everyone's been ignoring me. I feel like I'm invisible. I'm just the loser middle kid Like you. Just because I'm a middle kid doesn't make me a loser. Then what does make you a loser? I am not a loser. Okay? And I was a baby once. And then you came along. And I was not happy about it. But then you peed on PJ and I thought, Hey, give the kid a shot. Look, someday you're gonna feel the same way a bout Charlie that I feel about you. Well, how do you feel about me? Let's put it this way-- The hottest guy in school is at our house right now, And I'm here with you. Look how cute she is. I am warming up to her already! Okay, Charlie's asleep, Gabe's playing a video game And we are finally alone. Hey, everybody! I have a bruised coccyx. Oh, come on! That's a funny word. Coccyx! The doctor gave him pain medication. Was that me? Sorry. I'm a little numb down there. Uh, actually, that's my ride. Of course it is. It's good to meet you, son. Oh, good night, sweetheart. Good night, sir. - Good night. - Good night. Coccyx! So that's how dad got my first kiss And how you flew for the first time. But the good news is-- Nah, there is no good news. I take that back! It's a text from spencer! He wants to hang out with me tomorrow night At his house! Oh! I've gotta go wash your puke out of my jacket. Oh, and, uh, one more thing-- When you're my age and you meet a cute boy, Do not, under any circumstances, ever ever bring him home. Cause if you do, well-- Good luck, Charlie. Oh, that's wonderful. Thank you so much for doing this. Hey, if I can't be there for my patients, What kind of pretend doctor am I? So, uh, do you ever think about shaving-- Like, everywhere? I did-- last week.

Mmm, these sandwiches will be yummy wummy. Yes, they will, yes, they will. Mom and dad have been talking like that ever since you arrived And if it's not over soon, I'm gonna go crazy wazy. - PJ! - what? What are you listening to? I downloaded a podcast on the history of ballet. - you like that? - More than baby talk. Would you like some fishy wishies with your cookie wookie? Yes, I would, yes, I would. Wait, guys, Charlie isn't even here. No, widdle baby take a nappy wappy upstairs. So why are you guys still talking like that? I don't weawy know. I guess we're just kinda fried. Well, we work all day, take care of a baby all night. Work shift, baby shift I've barely got time to make doo-doo Well, when was the last time you guys had a night out? You know, like just the two of you-- like a date? Teddy made a funny. A funny wunny. Seriously! you know what? it's saturday night. You two, you go out, have fun, And do something besides work, take care of the baby and make doo-doo. Well, it's nice to dream, but who's gonna take of Charlie Hello! you've got three great babysitters right here. I'm glad I didn't hear that. I don't know, Teddy. It's a really nice thought, But we're really not ready to go out without Charlie just yet - You guys want to see a magic trick? - Sure! - Okay. - Prepare to be amazed. I could use a night out. Today's all burnt toast{\i0} Running late,and dad jokes{\i0} Has anybody seen my left shoe{\i0} I close my eyes, take a bite{\i0} Grab a ride, laugh out loud{\i0} There it is up on the roof{\i0} I've been there, I've survived{\i0} So just take my advice{\i0} Hang in there, baby, things are crazy{\i0} But I know your future is bright{\i0} Hang in there, Baby{\i0} There is no maybe{\i0} Eveything turns out all right{\i0} Sure life is up and down{\i0} But trust me, it comes back all around{\i0} You're gonna love who you turn out to be{\i0} Hang in there, Baby{\i0} All right, you guys have fun.

Hey, Teddy, thanks for doing this. It's gonna be nice for your mom and I to have some special time together - Bob, move your butt! - I'm coming! All right, so we divide it up evenly, We each get to spend an hour with Charlie. Who wants to go first? I think you should go first. And second and third, since this was your idea. Hey, I'm not doing this all by myself. you guys have to help out. Fine. I'll go fourth. There is no fourth. I meant I shall go forth to the park to shoot some hoop. You want to go to the park so badly, Then why don't you just take Charlie? What's a baby supposed to do at the park? Babies love parks. you can show her the duck pond, The blue sky, clouds. We're just gonna look at stuff? that's what TV is for. Yeah heh hah, all right! This is great. Whee! Yes, whoo! What are you looking at? I was here first. Hey, you can ride that duck. I couldn't ride the duck. I'd look silly on the duck. Fine. Hey there, Charlie. Are we having fun yet? All right. Man, you seen a kid's birthday party around here anywhere? I'm the entertainment. I saw a bounce house of the other end of the park. A bouncy house, eh? Great. Another trip to the E. R. Who are you supposed to be anyway? Plastic man, rubber man? No, those are all registered trademarks. I'm Captain Stretchy. There used to be a CS here, but it came off in the wash. So what's your super power? Super elasticity. Hey, look, there's a quarter. Ah, forget it. Not like it's a dollar, right? - Hi. - Hi. Oh, yeah, I like your taste in strollers. Thanks, you too. - That baby's so cute. - You too. Oh, I mean yours too. - I'm Emma. - I'm PJ - Who's this little guy? - My brother. We're just out for our stroll. We do this every day. Us too. Like I always say, babies love parks. - Would you like to sit for a bit? - Sure. So I saw you talking to Captain Stretchy earlier. Oh, yeah, he was lost. - Not much of a superhero, right? - Oh, he's the worst. We hired him for my brother's birthday party - and he sat on the cake. - That sounds awful. Oh, it gets worse. The candles was lit, so he sat in the punch That's so weird. I mean he looks like such a quality entertainer. You know, PJ, I'm really impressed that you take your baby sister to the park. My brothers would never do anything like that. I hope not. She is my sister. Now watch closely. In this hand I have a quarter And in the other, an ordinary egg. Now I put them in this hat, spin them around a little And presto. Just out of curiosity, What was supposed to happen? I love this baby. Anytime she wants to go to the park, sign me up. What happened to you? Let's just say charlie made a friend, PJmade a friend. Oh-- and did either you or your friend bother to change a diper? There's no time for that. I was too busy talking to Emma. - Who's emma? - A vision, An angel, the girl who's moved into my heart. Did you tell her about the vacancy in your brain? - PJ? - what? You brought home the wrong baby. What? I did not. Take a look! Wrong parts. There's nothing wrong with those parts. How could you bring home the wrong baby? I'm sorry. I got a little distracted. Emma is really cute. Yeah, well, so was our sister. Come on, let's go to the park and find her. Relax! I got her number. Then what are you waiting for? call her. Wait a second. Is it too soon? If I call now, she'll think I'm desperate. Oh, you are desperate. Good point. Hello, is Emma there? This is a Chinese restaurant? Sure, I'll hear the specials. She gave you the wrong number. Who couldn't see that one coming? But I gave her gum and helped her change a poopy diaper. It was so romantic. Well, what do we do now? Oh no! Hi mom, what up? Yeah, everything's going great. why wouldn't it be? We're just having a grand old time here with-- Baby Yeah, sure you can talk to him. her her! Talk to mommy. What do you mean that did't sound like Charlie? What, do you just think I'm making baby noises into the phone? Mom, that's crazy. All right, bye. Say bye, Charlie. Not that I'm in the position to criticize, But I was getting more monkey. Come on, let's go to the park. And meet the girl who blew off PJ? I'm there. - I don't see her. - PJ, what did she look like? She was hot, but what does it matter? Maybe we should call someone. who do you call when you search a baby. Captain Stretchy! What is that? You're still here? Every saturday and sunday all day long. Stay in school, kids. Just the guy we needed to see. I think you can help us. Hey, kid, I'm just an entertainer. I can't get mommy and daddy back together. No, you don't understand. I was talking to a girl here earlier, And she said that you worked a party for her brother. So? I work lots of parties. Where was the party where you fell on cake? You got three hours? This is really important. We need to find her. Interesting situation. You kids need info, - And I need a mirdle. - What is a mirdle? That's a man girdle. And they ain't cheap. Yeah, neither is dry cleaning, apparently. Her name's Emma. Did she come back to the park? Well, maybe she did And maybe she didn't. Stop rubbing your fingers together and answer my question. He wants a bribe. I can't believe it. Here. Here is what I konw: Her name is Emma. I just told you that. I didn't say the information was fresh. Yeah, I know the girl. She comes from a big family-- seven, eight kids. For them I've been Astronaut Pete, cowboy Bob - Magic Marv? - Yeah! You're familiar with my work. Yeah, and it stinks. I'm just starting off - And I'm a better magician than you are. - Oh yeah? You think this is easy, huh? here. Turn that into a schnauzer. You can't do it, huh? Maybe it's because you don't have the chops! Well, Stretchy, do you know where she lives? Yeah, around here somewhere. - I'd know it if I saw it. - Great! Now you help us tonight and we'll get you into that mirdle tomorrow. Oh, and you understand we're not actually Gonna put you into it? That you have to do by yourself. Yeah, I get it. All right, come on, guys, we have to go find her. Uh, hey-- Captain Stretchy, away! - Truck's this way. - Oh, okay. Order whatever you want, honey. I get a discount here. This place is one of my best customers. Not what you want to hear from an exterminator. Oh, look at that. Oh, fajitas. Not that, the baby. A little baby in a stroller just like ours. Yeah, okay, honey, This is supposed to be a night away from the baby. So let's come back. Okay okay, I'm back. I'm back. Just gotta run to the ladies' room. Oh oh, hey, listen, while you're in there, Could you check the traps? Hola. Adios. Bob, will you go over and look at that baby? - I think it's Charlie. - What?! You heard me, that is Charlie! Sweetheart, would you sit down, please? I will not sit down. A mother knows her own baby and that is my baby. Honey, seriously, what do you think happened here? In the last hour somebody went over to our house, Borrowed our baby then brought her out for chips and guac? I don't know, it's a big family. - Maybe that's how they get their babies. - Sweetheart, I think you're just missing Charlie And you're having a little separation anxiety. Oh, okay. You're right. Crazy wazy. - I mean, that isn't possible, right? - Exactly. I'm just going to go to the ladies' room one more time. Sit down. Now let's enjoy the rest of our night out At this very lovely restaurant. - Okay? - Okay. I'm needed in the kitchen. - Charlie! - Emma! - Charlie! - Emma! - Marco! - Polo. Gabe, not helping. Stretchy, is any of this looking familiar? Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. You are not getting any more money. No, I have night blindness. All I'm seeing is shapes. Why didn't you mention that earlier? I needed a ride home. Stop here. Oh, great. Mom's up. Maybe I'll just hang with you kids. Captain Stretchy, away. - Good night, Stretchy. - Good night, Stretchy. Good night. Now what? We didn't hit the streets on the north end of the park. PJ, we can't keep driving around all night. It's over. We have to tell mom and dad. - But-- - No, it'll be okay. They know what to do. They always do. How am I gonna tell them I lost our baby sister? I'm the oldest. They're gonna think I'm the most responsible. PJ, if it makes you feel any better, Nobody thinks that. Why do I always mess everything up? You know what? This could have happened to any of us. All right, probably most likely you, but-- This one, we're all in it together. Thanks. Hey, look, Captain Stretchy dropped his driver's license. 175 lbs, my butt! There they are. All right, let's get this over with. Do you think it would be better or worse if we had the mariachi deliver the news. If it's in spanish, probably better. Wait, I don't believe it. - That's Emma. - So that's Charlie. Yes! Oh, we're saved. - Not quite. - Hey, kids. - What now? - I'll let you know when I think of it. Mom, dad, hi. - Hi. - What are you doing here? We just realized you must be missing Charlie, So we brought her. Oh, Teddy, you're not fooling me. - I'm not? - Nope. You spent a little too much time with Charlie And you're ready to hand her over early. Well, I wouldn't say too much time. Well, I am ready too, so let me at her. - Gimme Gimme Gimme. - Mom, Mom, Mom. You're on a date. Let me bring her to you. Here? Wait, now? Well, all right. - Hey, mom. - Hi, baby. - Hey. - Hey, dad. - Something I want to show you. - What is it, honey? And now for my next trick, I'm gonna make a boy disappear. You know, you should be ashamed of yourself. You lead a guy on, make him think you have a connection, And you give him a fake phone number. You put it in wrong. that three is supposed to be a two. Oh, my bad. So You wanna get a table? My widdle baby, did you miss your mommy and daddy? Yes, she did. yes, she did. Oh, I never thought I'd be so happy to hear baby talk. Teddy, this isn't Charlie's binky. where did you get this? Oh, well, that's actually a really funny story. See, what happened was Too loud. Tell you later. Well, Charlie, now you're home safe and sound And everything turned out okay. For you. It would have been okay for us too, but when we got home, Mom started asking all these questions And no one really had an answer to the pee stains in the living room. And that's when the truth came out and all the kids got into trouble. So the lesson is if you ever try to pull anything over on Mom, Good luck, Charlie. Couldn't have said it better myself. In this hand I have a quarter. And in the other hand, an ordinary egg. Now I put them in this hat, Spin them around and Presto! Now hold out your hand. Wow, that's a great trick. How'd you do that? Interesting situation. It seems you need information, Meanwhile I need a new video game. What a chump. Who you calling a chump? Hey, get back here.

I can arrange that. Charlie, those are our neighbors, the Dabneys. They've been married a long time. Hey, PJ, I just kicked the football into the Dabneys' backyard. Will you go get it? No way! they're going at it again. - Well, what about the football? - Who cares? It's gone. Kiss it goodbye. Well, I'm glad to hear you say that Because it was your football. Ha! I warned you! That's what you get for being a bad husband! And now you're dead! Is somebody out here? Who's out here? - Where's the football? - Forget the football! Mrs Dabney just murdered Mr Dabney! What?! I heard her talking to his corpse. It was chilling. Just so I'm clear, you didn't get the football? - I'm serious, Gabe. - Come on. Mrs Dabney may be a mean, vicious, cruel, horrible, nasty old witch, But she'd never do something like that. - You don't believe me? - No. Fine. fine, I'll prove it. Come here, Gabe. Hello? Is Mr Dabney home? He can't come to the phone. Interesting. Who is this? Uh-- I'm some sort of salesman. Gabe, is that you? Why would you assume my name is gabe? Because I have caller ID. Oh. then yeah, it's Gabe. Hey! Whoo! She's cool under pressure, I'll give her that. - PJ, she's not a murderer. - I heard what I heard, gabe. Why don't you believe me? Because you're you and you get things wrong. What are you saying, that I'm dumb? Well, no. You're just not very - thinky. - thinky? Gabe, why would you say something like that? 'cause mom said I can't call you dumb. It is so pathetic. My mom's in the kitchen texting away. Gosh, I'd hate to be on the other end of that conversation. Who are you texting? - Your mom. - I am so sorry. Look, I promise I'll get her out of your hair. No, it's okay. Your mom's cool. My mom is what? And she's really funny. My mom is what? Wait, that's her again. What are you talking about with my mom? - Nothing. - Nothing?! That's what we say to her! Hold on, I have to lol her. Okay, well lol has officially lost all meaning. I'm sorry. is this a problem for you? No, I just think it's a little bit inappropriate. Inappropriate? Now you sound like my mother. Well, how would you know what your mother sounds like? You've been spending so much time with mine! What are you getting so whacked about? You didn't want to text her. Well yeah, that's because she's my mom, not my friend. Wouldn't you be weirded out if I was texting your mom? Yes. Because she doesn't have a cell phone. Look, T, if you're not cool with this, I'll just stop. No no, I don't care. I mean, it's a free country. Go crazy-- text my mom, IM my dad, video-chat my aunt Helen. Ooh! your aunt Helen? Your mom says she is da bomb diggitty! My mom really said da bomb diggitty? Well, I may have added that part. PJ, you've got to stop watching these mysteries. Not until i figure out how to catch Mrs Dabney. These old movies are gonna help me do that. That's like saying cartoons will teach you how to run through walls. Learned that the hard way. Mom! Can you get that?! Sure, I'll get the door. I am a lot closer to it. Hello, Mrs. dabney. - Hello. - Come on in. Heads up! killer in the house. What have they done this time? For once, nothing-- that I know of. It's nice to see you too. I'd like to speak with your husband, please. I'll let him know you're here. I'm a texter now. I'm texting. Really speeds things up. Somebody lose a ball today? Possibly. Did you lose anything today, Mrs Dabney? Honey, what does this mean  somebody's at the doof. OMG! I meant door! TTYL. What can I do for you, Mrs Dabney? - You're an exterminator, right? - pest control specialist. Maybe you can help me with a problem I'm having. How do I get the smell of death out of my house? Will you turn that TV down? So you think something died in your house? Oh, I know something is dead Well, first thing you're gonna have to do is locate and dispose of the carcass. I suppose you could get Mr Dabney to do that. Oh, Mr Dabney won't be doing anything around the house for a while-- A long while. he's gone. You know what, would you just turn it off? What's wrong with your boys today? I just got here. Um, all right, old trick of the trade Get yourself some maple syrup, put it on the stove, Let it simmer-- that should get rid of the smell. Thank you. That's very useful information. Bye, boys. ITBOOTP What does that stand for? In the bathroom out of toilet paper! TMI! I can't believe it, but you were right! Mrs Dabney did it. Wow! this is what it feels like to be right, huh? I like it! Too bad somebody had to die, but-- - What are we gonna do now? - I have to tell mom and dad! They're never gonna believe you. I didn't believe you and I'm 10. Well, then we need proof. And I have to warn you, Gabe, until we get that proof, Our lives may be in danger. I thought we turned that off. What'd you get for number nine? Switzerland. Well, that's odd since we're doing math. - Hi. - Hi. Mom, what are you doing here? You weren't supposed to pick me up at five. Teddy left a message and said to come by early Something about chilling? Yeah, that's right. Thought your mom and I could chill for a little while. Really? This is what you're doing? Yeah well, this is what we're doing, So if you will excuse us, - We'd like a little privacy please. - Sure. fine. I'll be in the kitchen with your mom. Come on over. Sit down next to me, girlfriend. What's this all about? Is ivy in trouble? Oh, no. Is she back on the chocolate? No no no, Ivy's fine. I just wanted to spend some time with one of the cool moms. - You. - Oh. Okay. I love your outfit. Where'd you get it? My closet. You are so funny. I bet you get that a lot, right? - No. - no? Are we done chilling? Yes. yes, we are. Because it is time to par-tay. Let's get jam started. Yeah! come on, Miss W! Let your freak flag fly! Yeah! That's kind of loud. Could you lower that, please? Yeah. A little bit more. A little bit more. Perfect.

Okay, she's gone. Here's how this is gonna go down. I'm gonna jump over the fence, you hand Charlie to me. - And then-- - Or I could just walk through the gate Like this. You did know there was a gate, right? Yes. would I be riding on top of it if I didn't? Now what? Now it's time to be in operation catch a killer While babysitting. So, what are we looking for? Evidence, clues, a weapon. Mr Dabney's rotting corpse would be nice. Oh my gosh, that's horrible! - What? what do you see? - That paint color-- It's so wrong for that room! - I watch a lot of design shows. - Focus! - Look. Something's moving. - Where?. By the couch, right-- right there. - It's a baby! - It's Charlie! No, it's not. charlie's right over-- inside the murder house! Okay, try to stay with me now Because we're going to get a little wild. Instead of knit one, purl two, We kick it up to knit one, purl three! Is that even legal? I don't know, But I just like living dangerously! Okay, I'm gonna go get something to drink. - Do you want anything? - Oh, not now. I'm in the zone! What you doing in here? Giving up. Did she suck the life out of you? Yeah, pretty much. Now you see why I'm always at your house. Yeah, I'm so sorry. I was being selfish with my mom. And even though I think it's a little bit weird, You can text her as much as you want. I think I got a better idea. And then, get this, If you type in a semicolon parentheses, - You get a-- - Winky face! I have got to get a cell phone. I like it. You put our moms together And they leave us alone. You are brilliant. See, this is why we're BFFs. I'm brilliant and you recognize it. Now if I type ROTF. Do I actually have to roll on the floor? I thought the same thing at first, But no. This'll get her out. Charlie loves things that rattle. Okay, girl. Charlie, come on. Get the keys. Get the keys! Aw, man! I dropped the keys. Fantastic! Now we can't get into our house either. - I don't see charlie. Where'd she go? - Oh, there she is. Wait, what is she putting on her head, A dishtowel? Mrs Dabney's underpants! Oh! - Man! - Oh-ho! Come on, we gotta get her out of there. Yeah, come on. What are you doing in my yard? We're here to help you with your groceries. You want to be helpful? I like to try new things. Here, let me give you a hand with that. I can handle the groceries. But as long as you're here, I could use your help with something inside. Inside? Perfect. Let me just put my groceries down. - Take your time. - Yeah. Yeah. - Where's Charlie? - uh-- - Look behind the curtains! - Okay. - Nothing! - There she is! Oh, I've got you. Yeah. I don't want it! Stop it! Where did that baby come from? Charlie? I've been holding her the whole time. - You have? - That's sad, Mrs Dabney. They say the eyes are the first things to go. We gotta go. Not so fast. Put the baby down. I need you to carry something out for me. I want you to take this trunk out to my car. It's too heavy for me. Why? What's in it? Something I should've gotten rid of a long time ago. - Where are you taking it? - To the dump. That's where you take trash, isn't it? Trash?! Mr Dabney wasn't trash, he was a person! What are you talking about? You know exactly what I am talking about. You bumped off your husband and stuffed him into that trunk. - Is that what you think?! - That's what we know! What is she-- oh, watch it! She's kill-crazy! You want to see what's in here? Take a look. Whoa! It's Mr Dabney! And he's already decomposed! That's not Mr Dabney. That's a skeleton he used in his classroom. He used to be a science teacher. But I heard you screaming at him. You called him a bad husband and then you said, and now you're dead! Oh! you must have heard me talking back to someone on my soaps. Soaps? Soap operas on TV Like the one they should name after you two-- the young and the clueless. Well, if Mr Dabney isn't dead, then where is he? At his mother's probably wishing he was dead. Well, then how do you explain the smell of death you asked my dad about? Dead possum in my dryer vent. Well, then how do you explain-- That's pretty much it, I guess. Just one more question-- Do you have any cookies? Get out. What are my underpants doing in the fireplace? Gotta go! Dat-da-da-da! Here she comes! Coolest mom in the world! Yay. Okay, what's all this? Oh, just showing Charlie how much I love you. Oh, I love you too, sweetie. And I love you too, Charlie. Oh, so mom, I've been thinking-- Maybe you and I should start texting. I mean, you are a pretty cool mom, right? Oh, sorry, honey. Those days are over. Text thumbs. Text thumbs? That's our mom-- From cool to embarrassing just like that. All right. good luck, Charlie. Hey, guys. Better make your friend a sandwich. He's looking a little thin. Where'd you guys get that thing? Mrs Dabney was throwing it out. Yeah, it belonged to Mr Dabney. He was a science teacher. Mr dabney wasn't a science teacher. He was a music teacher. What?! - That means-- - This is-- Mr Dabney wasn't a music teacher. You're thinking of-- of Mr Dixon across the street. Oh, that's right. Mr Dabney was a science teacher. The boys seem a little jumpy to you? Ah, I just got here.
Hi, Charlie. Teddy here. And Ivy. So you're 11 months old now and something really big is about to happen to you. You're about to take your very first steps. This is your biggest milestone since your first solid poop. Okay, relax. I didn't get it on video. Okay, you're my best friend again. Anyways, I wanted to capture your first steps on tape but every time I put the camera on you, all I see is this. Wait. Wait. Wait. And nothing. Same thing happened with the poop. Today's all burnt toast{\i0} Running late,and dad jokes{\i0} Has anybody seen my left shoe{\i0} I close my eyes, take a bite{\i0} Grab a ride, laugh out loud{\i0} There it is up on the roof{\i0} I've been there, I've survived{\i0} So just take my advice{\i0} Hang in there, baby, things are crazy{\i0} But I know your future is bright{\i0} Hang in there, Baby{\i0} There is no maybe{\i0} Eveything turns out all right{\i0} Sure life is up and down{\i0} But trust me, it comes back all around{\i0} You're gonna love who you turn out to be{\i0} Hang in there, Baby{\i0} Girls, girls, come here. Check it out. It's an old video of me. Lots of videotaping in this family. You guys sure do like yourselves. It's from my old glory days back at south high. No way, Mrs. D. You went to our school?. No, you're going to my school. Whoa whoa, there I am-- The school mascot. You were that big sheep thing? Not a sheep. A ram. Rammy the Wammy. Here it is-- My famous wammy wiggle. Listen to the crowd. They love me. Well, sure. Everybody loves a dancing sheep. Again, It's a ram. It has horns. It sure looks like a lot of fun, Mom. You really think so? Yeah yeah. Do you think I'd say something like that Just to humor you? I'm so happy to hear that Because they're holding mascot tryouts this week. But, mom, you've already been wammy. Why would you try out again? I'm talking about you. Please tell me You Is Ivy. Think about it, Teddy. You would be the first ever second-generation wammy. I've been dreaming about this since you were born. According to the internet, sheep can have horns. Look, I don't want to put any pressure on you. It's your decision. You do not have to do this for me. - I don't?  - No. You'll do it for us. - Hey. - What are you doing? Watching all my old wammy videos with Teddy. Teddy? You're missing all the good parts. What am I saying? They're all good parts. Except for this one. Remember this, Bob? Oh, how can I forget? The night the north high barbarian took you down. Oh! I hated that guy. Even for a barbarian, he was a jerk. You remember the time those goons from north high grabbed you, took you on a little joyride? Every wammy's worst nightmare. You know what? I can't even watch it. It's too painful even now. Oh, wait, this is a good part. Come here, kids. You're gonna love this. Recognize that guy? Is that PJ? Nope, that's me. You mean that thin guy with a full head of hair is you? Yep. So that means I'm gonna look like you when I get old. Oh, I stopped looking like that when I was 25. But that's only eight years from now. Enjoy it while you got it. If I were you, I'd marry young. What are you doing in here? Not being out there. What tape is she up to? Volume three, Wammy behind the mask. Dad, she wants me to try out. Oh, boy. I knew this day was coming. But I don't want to be a mascot. I'll be the biggest dork in school. You gotta help me out here. - What do you want me to do? - Can't you talk to her? Yeah, okay. I'll do that, honey, right after I mention that her favorite pants make her look fat. - Who looks fat? - My mother. Hey, we almost ended at the same time. Only because I dropped one of my sticks. Did you see Charlie? She was totally rocking out. - Is she amazing or what? - She's okay. Okay? What is that supposed to mean? You guys are always going on and on about what a super baby charlie is. Man, I got a nephew mason. Now that's a baby. What's so great about Mason? Well, for one thing he's a stud at peek-a-boo. Come on, Charlie can play peek-a-boo with her eyes closed. That's how you play peek-a-boo. What else you got? Well, Mason's an incredibly fast crawler. Not as fast as Charlie. She's like a cat. Mason sleeps at night with a rabbit-- Not a stuffed one, one that he caught. So you think mason's faster. I think charlie's faster. There's only one way to settle this. We challenge you to a baby race. Oh, it is on. And you're gonna be sorry Because mason rhymes with racin'. We'll take our chances. In the meantime, you might want to take a good look at this, Because that's all you and mason are gonna be seeing. I can't believe you're trying out for wammy. The whole idea behind this friendship was for you to make me more popular, Not less popular. Okay, relax. I said I had to try out. I didn't say I had to do well. All right, people. Time for wammy tryouts. - First up, Teddy Duncan. - I'm Teddy. Daughter of Amy Duncan, The second finest wammy this school has ever seen. - Who was the first? - You're looking at her. Let's do this thing! All right, duncan, let me set the scene for you. The team is down by eight. You need to get that crowd jazzed up. Now give me what you got! Come on, crowd, jazz up. I am not feeling that. Moving on. How's your dancing? You tell me. What was that? That was interpretive dancing. That piece was called Spring Day. I can also show you Global Warming Or Dogs Wow! Dancing-- question mark. Question mark? That stuck, exclamation point! All right, duncan, one more thing. Take that flag there and fire up that crowd. There's something wrong with that flag. Duncan, that was absolutely terrible, all of it. It's okay. I know what you're gonna say. Congratulations, wammy. But I was awful. Yeah, but you're the only one who tried out. See you at the big game. I can't believe this. Well, in hindsight, I guess we should have noticed that nobody else was here. Hey, Gabe, do me a favor. Check the back of my head. Does it look like I'm going bald? Well, it's tempting to say yes, So yes. Seriously? No. Your hair is as full and stupid-looking as ever. Thank you. You're a good brother. Is this why you wanted me to come down here? No, it is time to train Charlie for the baby race. Charlie? I thought the baby race was gonna be You and Emmett in diapers. Now I've lost interest. Okay, turbo baby, Let's see what you've got. Looks like I've got a little work to do. There she is. Hi, mom. Hi, Wammy. Oh, did Miss Covington call you? No, it's on the school website. Already? There's not a picture up of me, is there? There is now. I just sent one in. And I've got a big surprise for you. I kept it at the end of my last season. It's been sitting in the back of the shed for the last 20 years. Then I can't wait to put it on my head. Come on. Get it on there, girl. We've got some work to do. Teddy, you look so beautiful. Smells like armpit in here. I know. You'll get used to it. Okay, I'm gonna teach you some of my signature Wammy moves. You gotta hit it hard, girl. Now you gotta keep in rhythm. And the best way to do that is with the Wammy wiggle. A-five, six, seven, eight! Now we're gonna build on that move. You ready? We're gonna get our steam up. It goes like this. Whoo, ah-whoo, ah-whoo. No no, sweetheart. You lost your wiggle. If you try to get your steam up without the wiggle, You'll just look like a fool out there. Sure wouldn't want that to happen. Next I want you to jump up in the air And you gotta land with your arms forming a big W. That's really cute. No no no, Teddy. It's all in the elbows. You're not Vammy. You're not Hammy. You're Wammy! Okay, girl, you do it. Now dig deep and let your fire fly! I can't do this. Sure you can. You just gotta practice. Wammy wasn't built in a day. No, I don't want to do this. What? I don't want to be Hammy or Vammy or Wammy! I quit. Hey, what did you do to your mother? I told her I didn' want to be a Wammy. I was just being honest with her. Honest? What are you thinking? How's she taking it? Not well. She's lying in bed with her Wammy head on, Stuffing tissues up her snout. I don't know. Maybe being Wammy was cool when you guys were in school Are you kidding me? It was never cool. Your mom just didn't know that. How could she not know that? Did she spend all four years of high school wearing that giant head? It was her yearbook picture. Look, Teddy, if you don't go to that big game There's gonna be no Wammy, And that is gonna break your mother's heart. Dad, I just don't want to look stupid. Look, you're gonna let your mom and everybody at school down Because you're afraid of looking stupid? Yes, thank you for understanding. Honey, I'm not gonna tell you what to do. But just remember, Sometimes the right decision Can feel like the wrong decision. And the hard decision can be the best decision. But the good decision Oh, come on, please just be Wammy! Hey, Wammy. Going somewhere? Ever been to north high? cause I was thinking We could all take a little trip. It's about to charge. Get it! Oh, this is the greatest prank ever! All right, let's see what nerd is wearing the costume this year. Dude, Wammy's old. Wammy is not old. Wammy had four kids. I didn't see her. Your mom's not in there. I can't believe it. She's the only reason I'm doing this stupid thing. Well, let's get out of here. Duncan, the gym's this way. Let me look at you. Not you Wammy. Put on the head. Oh, you look so much like your mother. Showtime! I'm right behind you, t. Got your back. Gentlemen, start your babies. Go! And they're off! Oh, look, Mason. Yummy yummy. Come to the peaches. Come to mommy. Come to mommy. Mason got the early lead. Charlie's bringing up the rear. Look at my boy go. He's barely breaking a sweat. At the halfway mark it's Mason, followed by Charlie. Come on, Charlie. You can do it. Coming down the home stretch. It's still Mason in the lead. Come on, Charlie. It's now or never. And the winner is Charlie! Oh my gosh! Charlie, you just took your first steps. Not your best day, Mason. What went wrong out there? We'll be back when we learn how to walk. Can you please take me back to the gym? No way. Not till the game's over. Okay, can you take me home then? I don't even care about the game, guys. North High, South High what's the difference? Only one thing - North High rules! - Yeah! Yeah, baby! Okay, whatever. Look, if we're gonna drive around in circles for hours, - Can I at least use the bathroom? - Can't you hold it? I've had four kids. I pee when I sneeze. Gross. Pull over. Thank you. You're such a gentleman. South High rules! Safety first. Ram on the lam! Staring at my baldness Ain't gonna stop your baldness. I just can't believe that's gonna happen to me. Would you stop focusing on the negatives? - Think about the positives. - Like what? You're gonna have a large baseball cap collection. You're gonna save on shampoo. And with the money you save on shampoo You can buy more baseball caps. Here comes Teddy. That's my best friend. Wammy's my best friend. Wammy! Wammy! Wammy! Well, Charlie, looks like we both took baby steps today. You walked for the first time And I did something I didn't want to do and wound up liking it. And I hope you like it too, because You are aready on your way. Wammy jammy! Good luck, Charlie. Come on, P. J. We're gonna be late for school. Get down here. Alright, coming. Chillax. Oh, oh, no. Oh, no. It's happening. No,I am not ready. No. - Bad Dream?  - Yeah. Oh, hey. Here's the first one my dad gave me.
Hey, Charlie, Teddy here On the couch where I almost got my first kiss with Spencer. But she didn't. No no, because I made the mistake of bringing the cute boy home Where my dear family lives. He wasn't that cute. Get out. Anyway, still waiting on that first kiss. But there's a dance this Friday Where the girls ask the guys, And this time I'm going to make sure I get it. Get what, honey? Oh, my first A+ in science, daddy. That's my girl. Hey, dad, great news. I got a job. Stop right there. I'm having the greatest dream of my life. The school's gonna pay me 100 bucks to DJ at the dance on Friday. The dream continues. I just need you to give me $200 to rent the DJ equipment. And now I'm awake. Hey, what was I doing in the dream? You weren't saying anything, which is why I thought it was a dream. P. J. , why would you take a job where you're gonna lose money?. Does everything always have to be about money? Are you giving me the 200? Sorry, son. You're gonna have to come up with the money some other way. Like how? Oh, I know. Get a job. I'll be right back. Wait, where's your sister? Don't bother her, Emmett. Okay, where shouldn't I bother her? In the kitchen. All right. Thanks Hey, Teddy bear. Hey, Emmett. You know this dance this Friday night isgirls ask guys, right? Uh-huh. You're a girl. I'm a guy. Something you want to ask me? Okay, Emmett, listen, P. J. is my brother and you're his best friend. So in a way you're kind of like my brother too. And I can't go to the dance with my brother. You can see why that would be wrong, right? This is the longest conversation we've ever had. Did you hear anything I just said? Something about wanting to go to the dance with a brother. Emmett, I want you to listen to me very carefully. I'm not going to ask you to the dance. When you touch me it feels like electricity. Today's all burnt toast{\i0} Running late, and dad jokes{\i0} Has anybody seen my left shoe{\i0} I close my eyes, take a bite{\i0} Grab a ride, laugh out loud{\i0} There it is up on the roof{\i0} I've been there, I've survived{\i0} So just take my advice{\i0} Hang in there, baby,{\i0} Things are crazy{\i0} But I know your future is bright{\i0} Hang in there, Baby{\i0} There is no maybe{\i0} Eveything turns out all right{\i0} Sure life is up and down{\i0} But trust me, it comes back all around{\i0} You're gonna love who you turn out to be{\i0} Hang in there, Baby{\i0} Hi, kids. Hey, mom. Come on, Charlie, let's go see daddy. You know what I realized today? Charlie's never played laser tag. I bet she'd enjoy doing that on Friday night. Oh, how very sweet and unselfish of you. But Charlie's gonna be with us Friday night. It's your school's open house. Right. Forgot about that. Well, we haven't. Dad and I can't wait to meet this miracle worker--Mrs. Mellish. She's the first teacher who hasn't called to complain about you. Are you sure he's actually going to school? Mom, you've been to so many open houses. And you'd love laser tag. It's like a workout but you get to shoot stuff. Oh, come on, we can play laser tag anytime. Meeting a teacher that has no problems with you-- That may never happen again. This is bad. What's bad? The only reason I haven't been getting in trouble Is that I told my teacher mom and dad have been fighting a lot. That actually works? You also have to give the teacher one of these. Wow, that's good. I almost hugged you. And I never want to hug you. Works even better on Mrs. Mellish. Any time I do something wrong-- Mommy and daddy were fighting again. Wow. Well, I guess your evil plan is gonna be over on Friday night, 'cause mom and dad won't be fighting. Or will they? So who are you asking to the dance? Okay, here's a hint. He's really cute and-- You ladies talking about me again? You know I'm not talking about you, Since I dumped your sorry butt a long time ago. That's now how me and my sorry butt remember it. Remind me again why you ever went out with him. Only one way to explain it-- Brain fart. Brain fart. So who's this cutie you're gonna ask? Spencer. Oh, right, Mr. Almost first kiss. You'd better get moving on that. Your window is closing. What window? The window of opportunity. Oh, thanks. That really clears things up. T, you almost kissed this guy, But nothing happened since then. If you don't act soon, you're doomed to be just friends. I like Spencer, he likes me, And I'll ask him when the time is right. That better be right now, chica, Because Lauren Sandoval is gonna ask him. Lauren would never do that to me. She's too good a friend. There's your good friend right now. Here? Walking up to Spencer What? That little witch! Yeah! Oh, Lauren, you poor thing. What a horrible, ugly tomatoey mess you are. Come on, pizza face, let's get you cleaned up. Come on. Oh, Spencer, hey. Didn't see you there. Hi, Teddy. Boy, that pizza really came out of nowhere, huh? Yeah. Nice shot. It's all in the wrist. Now tell me again And don't leave out a single detail-- What exactly did Spencer say when you asked him? He said, and I quote, Okay. Oh, wouldn't it be so romantic If I got my first kiss during a slow dance? That could happen if you don't wear that red polka dot thing That makes you look like a clown. No no, you're right. I should dress more subtle and understated Like you. That's all I'm saying. Now I just have to figure out How Spencer and I are gonna get to the dance. How are you getting there? I haven't asked anyone yet. I'm still trying to decide between five guys. Well, do any of them drive? Let's see Sophomore, freshman, sophomore, Eighth-grader I don't really want to talk about, And sophomore. So no, no drivers on the list. That's too bad, because if you could find somebody who drives Then Spencer and I could double with you. Yeah, consider it done. I'll just expand my list And lower my standards a little bit. Lower than the eighth grade? You want a ride or not? Okay, they say it's gonna be chilly tonight. I want to make sure you're nice and toasty. Did I remember to change your diaper? I'm gonna go with yes. Are you ready to go? Yeah It is gonna be so nice to go to an open house And not to have to hear the words Oh, you're Gabe's parents. Mom, are you wearing perfume? I am. Oh. What? You don't like it? Oh, I like it, but But what? Does someone else not like it? I don't want to get dad in trouble. Wait, dad says he doesn't like my perfume? He doesn't just say it. He makes a face too. And sometimes there's gagging. Oh. Well, that's interesting. Has your father shared anything else with you About how I disgust him? I've said too much already. Oh, okay. Okay. Nice jacket, dad. Isn't it? Got my company logo right there-- Free advertising and a great conversation starter. Does mom know you're wearing it? Oh, I've been dressing myself for some time now. So no, I didn't run it by her. Oh, I guess she'll just have to live with it. Why? Is there a problem? I don't want to get mom in trouble, But just between us, She thinks you talk too much about your job. I talk too much about my job-- The same job that puts a roof over your mother's head? Hey, I'm on your side. So what else does she say about me behind my back? I've said too much already. Come on, guys. Gotta go. Gonna be late. Well, we're taking the bug truck, If that's okay with you. As long as the windows work. I don't want to trigger anyone's gag reflex. Women. Hey, good luck at your open house tonight. Good luck at whatever you're dressed so weird for. Look at you. Oh, no, look at you. Well, I wish I was someone else So I could look at both of us. So where's your date? Parking the car. Oh, I like it. Who is he? Okay, about that-- there's something you should know-- 'sup? Emmett, would you excuse us for a minute real quick? Okay, just-- Emmett? We needed transportation. It was either emmett or an eighth-grader With a skateboard. Let's just go have a good time, okay? Shall we? Teddy bear. Grizzly bear. You look really nice. You are really nice. Thanks. Whose car is this? My grandpa's. He thinks I'm at the store getting bread. But instead You'll be at the dance getting nothing. Wow, looks like my seat belt's broken. Maybe I should sit in the middle. Is that okay? Yeah. 'cause I'm all about safety. Teddy, you're blocking my view. You mind moving away from Spencer? Big guy, lean the other way. More. More. Emmett, if he leans any more, he'll fall out of the car. More. Well, this is my classroom. Mrs. Mellish looks busy. Maybe we should come back next year. Whoa, p-u alert. I get it, okay? I'm talking about Charlie's diaper. What's her problem? Heck if I know. And for your information, Some people find that scent very pleasant. A full diaper? I'm gonna be back in a minute. I'm gonna go change Charlie, okay? Okay Hi, Gabe. Hi, Mrs. Mellish. How is my brave little soldier? Not good. mom and dad are fighting again. Oh, you poor thing. They've been fighting all week. I don't think I can get that book report into time you on Tuesday. That's okay, dear. You take all the time you need. I don't need time. I need happiness. Oh. All right. That song was brought to you by Freddy's stereo hut. When you're ready to rock steady, go see Freddy. P. J. , what's with all the commercials?. That's how I'm paying for all the equipment. I got some sponsors to buy advertising. Who would buy advertising from you? You'd be surprised. This next one is brought to you by mom Who gave me 20 bucks. Mom-- when you absolutely, positively Can't get any more money out of dad. Bob, come here, honey, look. Look at this picture Gabe drew. Isn't that sweet? Yeah, it sure is. You know what, honey? I guess we're doing something right. Would you look at that? Gabe, it seems like your parents are getting along. I'm gonna go introduce myself. Gotta think. gotta think. It's go time, Ricky. Excuse me, lady. You've got a rat on your shoulder. Rat on the loose! Remain calm. Remain calm. Remain calm. Remain calm. Spencer, could you get me some punch, please? Sure. I'll be right back. Emmett, why don't you go get me some punch too? What, your feet don't work? Ice or no ice? Surprise me. I think it's time for me to make my move. Go get that kiss, girl. Hey, P. J. , put on a slow song, okay?. You got it, sis. Okay, we're gonna bring it down now, Just like you should bring yourselves down to Wally's Waffles. Tell them P. J. sent you. You can get a free pat of butter. Here you go. Oh, thanks. Let's dance. Yo, quick, throw on some hip-hop. But I just started this song. Now. Okay, this next one is brought to you by Emmett. Emmett-- he's Standing right there. What just happened? Emmett stole my date. Back we go, little guy, Safe and sound. Boy, really tired. We should go. Thank you, Mr. Duncan. That was very impressive. Well, when you've been in the pest control biz As long as I have, you-- You know, I really shouldn't talk about my work. It bugs my wife. No, it doesn't. Why would you think that? Because Gabe told me it did. Charlie looks more tired than me, so Gabe told me you hated my perfume. I never said that. What are you talking about? Oh, please don't do this here. Isn't it bad enough that poor Gabe has to listen To you two constantly fighting at home? We don't fight at home. We're very happy. Look at this picture Gabe drew of our family. That's not his. That's Gabe M's. This is Gabe D's. That's disturbing. Mrs. mellish, I assure you we're a very loving family. Gabe, get your butt over here. Now why would you tell your teacher that we're fighting at home. So I could get out of doing my work. I'm in big trouble, right? Oh, yeah. Have all your overdue assignments on my desk Monday morning. But that'll take me the whole weekend. You poor thing. Get your coat. We're leaving. I can't believe we let him play us like that. I know. How could I ever think you didn't like my perfume? Well, it's not my favorite. Said the guy with the cartoon cockroach on his blazer. It's an ant. Man, your jerking is dope. Man, your popping-- sick. I'd like to pop both of these jerks. Sorry you didn't get that kiss. Yeah, well, the night's not over yet. Follow my lead. Hey, what's that noise? What noise? The noise teddy is talking about. Sounds like it's coming from the back of the car. Yeah, I hear it too. It sounds bad. You should probably pull over and check it out. - I'm telling you--  - Stop the car! Just come on, I'll show you where the noise is coming from. I know where the noise is coming from. You want to keep that head? I suggest you not do that again. Oh, sorry, sorry. In my head that went a lot smoother. Hello there. Hi. Look, I'm sorry I got so caught up with Emmett and the dancing. I kind of like the way things were going before then. Yeah, me too. I'm glad we got to go to the dance together. I was a little nervous because Ivy said my window closing. And then Lauren Sandoval almost asked you. and then Ivy and Emmett showed up at my house And I was like, oh, no. how is it gonna working. And I just-- That was a really nice way of telling me to shut up. Well, Charlie, I finally got my first kiss tonight And now I can't stop smiling. I mean who knew that Emmett's grandpa's car Would turn out to be the most romantic place in the world? Okay, I'm gonna try and stop smiling. No, I can't do it. Man, look at that girl working. Wow. I thought we were good. Not as good as that. She's got it going on.
So then Spencer said, Are you coming to my party tonight? And inside I was like, Waah! But on the outside I was like, Sure, whatevs. So then I said, What should I bring? And he said, Just your cute self. And that time I did say, Waah! Hi, honey. Oh, hey, mom. Homework call. Sorry. Where's charlie? Kitchen, with Gabe. Charlie did it. What in the world? Well, charlie asked for a milkshake. Like a good big brother, I decided to make one. Then she forgot to put the top on the blender. So you put your baby sister in charge of an electrical appliance? And she let me down. Teddy, get in here. Mom, I'm on the-- wow. Gotta call you back. Care to explain what's going on here? Uh, a chocolate bomb went off? I asked if we could make milkshakes And teddy did this. And then she started talking about her party again. That's what we call homework sometimes-- a party-- cause it's so fun. Okay, you know what? That's it. No T. V. , no computer, no video games. For the rest of the day. I think that's fair. And you're watching him. That's so unfair! And Charlie. Mom, I have to get ready for my party. That's just too bad. And what did I tell you about lying? It only works on dad. Now both of you, clean this mess up. My poor little baby. I gotta give you a bath. Mwah. Or I could just lick you clean. Today's all burnt toast{\i0} Running late, and dad jokes{\i0} Has anybody seen my left shoe{\i0} I close my eyes, take a bite{\i0} Grab a ride, laugh out loud{\i0} There it is up on the roof{\i0} I've been there, I've survived{\i0} So just take my advice{\i0} Hang in there, baby,{\i0} Things are crazy{\i0} But I know your future is bright{\i0} Hang in there, Baby{\i0} There is no maybe{\i0} Eveything turns out all right{\i0} Sure life is up and down{\i0} But trust me, it comes back all around{\i0} You're gonna love who you turn out to be{\i0} Hang in there, Baby{\i0} Good morning, dad. you gonna get to that lawn today? You know, when someone says Good morning, The traditional response is Good morning back. Sorry. You gonna get to that lawn today? So where you off to? I'm meeting with some jingle writers, Getting ready to shoot a new commercial for bob's bugs be gone. A jingle? That's like a song, right? That's right, a catchy little tune that sticks in your head And drives you just a little bit crazy. You know emmett and I have a band, right? You know we have a lawn mower, right? Don't you think you should give us a shot at writing your jingle? P. J. , come on, music's a great hobby for you,. but I need a professional. Come on, just give us a chance. All right, okay. If you guys wanna take a shot at it, knock yourselves out. You will not be sorry. And then one day when I accept my grammy for best exterminator jingle, I'm gonna say, This one's for you, dad. And my girlfriend Taylor Swift. What up, Tay-tay? What's wrong with you? No t. V. , no computer, no video games. I'm freaking out. Why don't you read a book? Sure, right after I clean my room. Do you even know me? You're a strange little dude. Where are you going? To the store. We're out of diapers. Please take me with you. You wanna go shopping for diapers? No, but I will not stay here and have these machines mock me. Again, a strange little dude. Okay, read back what we have so far. Okay. Jingle number one, Written by P. J. And emmett. That's it. Think. Gotta think. Oh, hey, my dad's name is bob. Maybe we should think of things that rhyme with Bob. How about blob, glob and slob? I'm doing a load of his whites. Man, writing a jingle is harder than I thought. Mom, we need some inspiration. Well, lucky for you, I wrote quite a bit of poetry in high school. Published five times in the school's literary magazine-- Whatever. Actually, I was thinking You could inspire us with some sandwiches. My first piece or-- back it up-- Should I say my first published piece Is called simply Locker. That's great. I'll take a ham and cheese-- Hey there, locker, Filled with my books and papers And secrets. I can't remember your combination. 37 right, 17 left, But then what? Am I locked out Or are you locked in? So good. So good. It's still so good. You wanna do this at my house? Well well well, Gabriel B. Duncan. Afternoon, hugo. The manager knows you? We have a history, yes. A word of advice, Duncan-- You knock over a display or joy-ride a shopping cart, And I will personally open a can of Reddi Mart's finest butt-kick. Hey, have you lost weight? Just kidding. I'm watching you, punk. Soda and mints? What are these for? I'm gonna make a soda geyser. You drop a mint into the bottle And it makes this huge explosion. Wow, that sounds so cool. Put them back. How come you get to buy lip gloss and I can't buy this stuff? It's completely different. Soda and mints won't make you look totally cute at a party. Thank you very much. What's going on? Why, it's gabe. I must be getting psychic. I didn't do anything. Mm-hmm, come on. Receipt. There you go. Huh, I'm seeing diapers, But I'm not seeing sunglasses. Explain. Explanation-- we didn't get sunglasses. Well, someone did. Charlie did it. This time she really did do it. She must have grabbed these when we weren't looking. That's so funny. You see me laughing? There's nothing funny about shoplifting. In case you didn't notice, hugo, we're still in the store. Unpaid items are considered stolen once they leave checkout. In case you didn't notice, we don't have cash registers in the parking lot. Tell alice to call the police. The police? You're arresting a baby? Or a very small person. We don't have all the facts yet. Turn her to the left. Don't you think it's a little ridiculous to take mug shots of a baby? That's procedure for shoplifters. Turn her to the right. Okay, Charlie, smile for Huge-oh. Sticks and stones may break my bones-- Agh! Are these the shoplifters? That's right. The perp is in the stroller. She's not a perp. She's a baby. Still undetermined. I called the police, but they said this was low priority And they wouldn't be here for three or four hours. Three or four hours? Alice, why can't you do anything right? It's not my fault. Please don't yell at me. How many times have we been over this? Whenever you tell me not to yell at you, It makes me want to yell at you! Hi, as entertaining and twisted as this all is, Can we please move it along? I have a party to go to. - You're going to a party? - Yes. That must be nice. Nitwit, do not fraternize with the suspects. Might as well make yourselves comfortable, Looks like you're gonna be here a while. I'll stay here as long as you want. - There's T. V. Here. - that's a security monitor. It's a screen and it's giving me pleasure. Alice, register 2 needs nickels. Hugo, I'm gonna bring nickels to register 2. I heard. Gabe, we gotta get out of here. Are you giving me permission to be bad? - Yes. - How bad? Do whatever it takes. I've been waiting to hear those words my whole life. No whispering. Hugo, I have to go to the bathroom. Yeah. Is this some kind of trick? It is-- a magic trick. I drink stuff up here and it comes out down here. All right, let's go. And you, don't do anything stupid. Like that? Like that? All right, let's hear what you got. This first song is one of my personal favorites. It's called Jingle number one. One, two, three, four. Bob's bugs be gone, bugs be gone He kills them dead dead dead dead dead dead! What do you think? I think you just loosened one of my fillings. Where's Hugo? Bathroom. Oh, no. That means I'm in charge for 30 minutes. Where have I heard that before? Heard what? The In French class? Oh, yeah yeah yeah. You're Alice wheezheimer. It's Wartheimer. It is? Are you sure? Is that what people call me behind my back-- Wheezheimer? No, not at all. Nobody calls you Wheezheimer Or Wheezy. Hugo calls me Alice in Wheezerland. Why do you let him treat you so badly? He's my boss. I have to. No, Alice, you don't. You have to stand up for yourself. If he yells at you, you yell back. Oh, I don't know. Believe it or not, I'm not much of a yeller. This guy is treating you like a doormat. - And that's bad? - Yes. You have to stand up and say, You can't mess with me. I'm Alice Wheezheimer! Wartheimer! That's the fire I'm looking for, Wheezy-- I mean Warty. Hugo, get your butt in here, Please. Da bug, mon Yeah, da bug, mon Don't delay, call Bob today Dial three Zero Three Guys. Fi-yi-yi-yive-- Guys guys guys. You haven't heard the second verse. That's your fax number. It's a 30-second commercial. You can't place artificial limits on our art. Yah, mon, da song needs to breathe a little. Look, guys, I gave you a shot, But I can't use any of these songs. Why not? Because they're not-- What's the word? --Good. P. J. , come on. It's just business. It's not personal. So I guess the polka number's out? Did you just tell me to get my butt in here? Uh uh Yes, she did. She's got something to say to you which is She's not your doormat, okay? She deserves to be treated with respect. How dare you talk to me that way? She's gonna talk to you any way I want to talk to you for her about. Price check on aisle 1, Volcanic geyser on aisle 2. This ends now. Let's go, Charlie. We're busting out of here. You little--! Come out, come out, wherever you are. Jalapeno-style. Hugo, catch me if you can. Gabriel! Clean up on aisle everywhere. Hey. You okay? - Dad, can I ask you something? - Sure. Do you think I should give up my dream of being a musician? Well, I think the only person That can answer that question is you. Then the answer is no. I'm not giving up. Good. That's good. You don't want to have any regrets. - I should know. - What do you mean? I had a dream too. I was gonna be a professional wrestler, man. I was gonna call myself Bobzilla. Bobzilla? Maybe five more minutes on the name, dad. Well, it all worked out fine. I've got a nice life and a wonderful family. Besides, you wouldn't want to see your dad on T. V. ,. beating up other guys, would you? That would be awesome. I know. So awesome, right? Well, I'm not giving up. In fact, I used the pain of rejection to write another song. Good for you. Can I hear it? The bug man crushed my dreams Everything I wanted to be Bob's bugs be gone Was the death of me. You know what? I think you speed that up, Have a bug sing it and we've got our new jingle. - Are you serious? - I'm dead serious. Yes! I did it! Now all I have to do is find a singing bug. Alice. Hey, what's going on? I wanted to tell you something. What was it? Oh, I got fired. That's terrible. I'm so sorry. No, it's wonderful. Then congratulations. After I turned in my smock, guess what? I stopped wheezing. That's great. Well, it's only been an hour and the pollen count is low. Well, let's keep our fingers crossed. Anyway, I just wanted to thank you For helping me stand up to Hugo. See you in French class. Hey, Alice, Would you like to come to a party? Really? I've never been invited to a party. - Never? - Nope. I threw one once for arbor day. Nobody came. Just me and a tree. Well, no trees at this party, just lots of cute boys. Oh, cute boys are better than trees. But you do realize You're going to have to talk to them, right? Sure, no problem. Or I'll talk to them for you. Well, Charlie, what a day. You almost got us arrested. I had an awesome time at Spencer's party. And we totally trashed a store. But amazingly, mom and dad never found out, So I think we got away with it. Teddy, honey, can I ask you a question? Sure, mom. Why is charlie's mug shot all over the reddi mart?

Well, maybe it's just the way you do it. Well, I do have a system. It's alphabetical. Okay, cardamom comes before cinnamon which comes before coriander. Whoa, I could listen to you talk about spices all day. -Then we go onto dill - Okay. Then it kind of jumps around to fennel. But instead, how about we talk about clothes? Like that awesome new top you're wearing. You like this? Honey, I've had it forever. And I especially love that splash of color on your shoulder. What, that? I think that's Charlie's puke. Let's talk about your shoes. Hello? Oh, hey, Ivy. You want me to come over? Oh no, sorry. I'd rather hang out with my mom. Okay, talk to you later. Bye. Are you sick? Are you gonna puke on me too?

Oh, and there's a DVD! Which we will watch After the pamphlet and the instruction manual. Dad, how long is this gonna take? Oh, not long. Oh, hey, look at this! Oooh, a before you watch the DVD card. If there's anything better Than a homemade facial with my bmf, I haven't heard of it. - B. M. F. ?  - Best mom forever. Oh my gosh! I would be smiling, but my face is going to crack. What's going on? Oh, just a couple girlfriends hanging out. What, is Ivy here? No, I'm talking about me and mom. We've been hanging out all afternoon. We went to the mall. We went shopping. Then we did some other stuff I can't tell you about. Yeah, well, I didn't ask. That's good cause we're not gonna tell you. Yeah, I'm gonna be in the other room. Oh, dad, I actually need to ask you guys about something. Is it okay if Ivy and I go to a midnight movie on Thursday? Thursday? No way, it's a school night. Bob, honey, you don't understand, okay? This isn't just any movie. This is Dusk. - What's that? - Hello! The movie about the vampires. The prequel to Dawn. So lame! All right, you know what? You wanna let her go, let her go. - Okay! Thank you, daddy. Thank you, girlfriend. - Teddy. Call me! What's that in your hair? It's called glitter. Get with it, grandpa. Emmett! Thank you. I can't believe I have to do this whole chemistry project by myself. Stupid Van Brundt! Hey, don't call him stupid. That's an insult to stupid people everywhere. That idiot can't even count to 10, Which, coincidentally, is the number of years he's going to be in high school. Guess that's my phone. Oh, that's weird. It says I have a call in progress. You probably sat on it and butt-dialed someone. Hello? Nobody there. Must have gotten voicemail. Who'd you dial? Van Brundt. Van Brundt! He's gonna hear everything we just said about him! You mean he's going to hear everything you just said about him. We were both talking about him, Emmett. Stop saying my name! - And hang up the phone!  - Yes! - Hey! - Hey. So did my evil plan work? Did you butter up your mom? Like popcorn at a midnight movie! What was that? Oh, it's just my phone. It's always making weird noises. So how'd you do it? Oh, it was so painful. I had to spend the whole day with her pretending she was cool. Longest day of my life. But it was all worth it Because we're going to see Dusk! When the sun goes down, his fangs come out. And his shirt comes off! It was all just a big trick so Teddy could get permission to see that vampire movie. Bob, she thinks I'm just as uncool as I thought my mom was. It's the great uncool circle of life. Well, honey, if it helps, I think you're cool. It doesn't. All right, so what's the punishment going to be? No movie, grounded for a week? Too easy. Mama's going to get even. You know nothing good ever happens When you start calling yourself mama. Mama doesn't care. There he is. Guess we should just go in there and get it over with.

Hey, Charlie, so I have a little advice for you. If you ever want to fool a parent, And make them think they're cool, dad is definitely the way to go. Just ask him about his job and pretend you're interested. Heard that. You're grounded. Baby monitor! Stupid technology. Heard that too. Yeah, I can't even imagine What kind of gadgets they'll have when you're a teenager, so Good luck, Charlie. Hey, honey. Here we go. Careful it's hot. I had a little quick question to ask you. Sure, mom, what's up? Okay, I want you just to be totally honest with me. I am cooler than Mary Lou Wentz, right? Of course you are, mom. Now tell me the truth. I am cooler than Amy Duncan, right? Definitely. Hey, sweetheart. Yeah, I'm talking to you. Listen, we got a problem with your brother. Not him, the little one with the big mouth. - You just talking with Charlie? - What? Never mind. Anyway, that little stinker was trying to get rid of me. I say we get rid of him. 'cause that would make me a happy happy horse happy happy happy horse. Stupid horse. Watch your back, kid. I'm a happy happy horse happy happy happy horse.

Whoa, what is that smell? I'm pregnant. I have gas. Deal with it. No, not that. It's worse. No, actually that smell is coming from your lunch.

Yeah, but I have to go fishing with you. Oh, hey, dad, can you drop me off at school? Ivy and I are doing our children's theater thing today - And we need to get into costumes. - Sure. Oh, and, Gabe, if you're not doing anything you can come see it. I wrote it, you know? It's a delightful fable About people from different worlds Who overcome their differences and become friends.

I'm calling for Dr. Singh. Yes, could you please let him know that I have gone into labor? And to meet me at the hospital? Okay, thank you very much. Bye-bye. Okay, we're gonna do this barefoot. Let's go have a baby. Mom! Hello? Is anyone home? Then no one can tell me not to do this. Mmm! Mmm. Okay, I tipped over the boat. How many times can I say I'm sorry? We've got a 45-mile drive to the hospital, I guess we'll find out. - Is that a bear? - In the truck? How'd he get in there? I don't know, son. Why don't you ask him? - How do we get him out? - We don't. He's the bear. He makes the decisions. Dad, you're an exterminator. You should deal with this. I will-- when he loses 600 lbs and fits in a mousetrap. How are we gonna get to the hospital? Start walking. Come on, let's go. Oh, man! He ate all the egg salad sandwiches. Oh, yes! I love that bear. Oh, good, Halloween's come early this year. Who are you two supposed to be? I'm Frankenstein and she's Gretel. It's for a play I wrote. I don't get it. Neither did the audience. What are you talking about? No, the kids loved it. Are you out of your flat head? It was a disaster. Then why were they cheering? Because we had to leave early. We're here to see Amy Duncan. Right in there. When Hansel and Dracula get here I'll send them in. - Hey, mom. - Hi, Frankenstein. Hi-- I had the same reaction when I saw this wig. Contraction. - Are you okay? - Super, great. Couldn't be better. All my ducks are in a row And everything's under control. So where's Gabe? I guess I left one of my ducks at home. Wait, Gabe's home alone? Oh, that is not good. Gabe, you okay? I'm awesome! Hey, check it out. Hey hey, anybody here? Dad, what are you doing? P. J. , we've got to get to the hospital. I'm just gonna see if I can hotwire one of these things. Uh, dad! You trying to steal our bikes? Not steal-- hotwire. No, look look look, before you do something you might regret, There is a perfectly good explanation. And I'd love to hear it Right after I gut you like a fish. You want your big knife or your really big knife? Surprise me. Boy, Charlie's really loving her birthday cake. I know. Isn't it adorable? When she does it it's adorable. When I do it it's wrong. And that's because we were at a restaurant and it wasn't your cake. Come on, let's get back to the story. Did the bikers gut you like a fish? - You were there. - Oh, right. All right, anyway, bikers were coming on strong, I had to come back stronger. Please don't hurt us. Please don't hurt us. Give us one good reason why we shouldn't. Because it would hurt. Look look look, you don't understand. My wife is having a baby and there's a bear in our truck. That's why I'm trying to borrow the bike. I can't-- I can't miss the birth of my child. That's beautiful. We gotta help these people get to the hospital. He hasn't been the same since he took up needlepoint. Oh, thank you. Thank you so much for helping us out. By the way, I'm Bob. This is my son P. J. We're mad dog and Francis. Good to meet you, mad dog. I'm Francis. She's mad dog. My real name's Shirley. If you call me that You'll gut him like a fish? You catch on real fast. Mrs. D. , can you keep it down a little bit?. I'm trying to win concert tickets. Where is he? I'm starting to get worried. Okay, mom, relax. I'm sure dad's going to be here soon. Dad?! Who cares about dad? I'm talking about Dr. Singh. He's delivered all my children. And, lady, I am not having this baby without him. Frankenstein, can I talk to you a minute? Yep. - Dr. Singh's not here. - Not yet?. Not at all. He's taking a personal day. It's his son's birthday. So you mean he's not gonna be here. Look, I know you have someone else's brain inside your head, So I'm gonna tell it to you slowly. Singh not coming. - Is everything okay? - Everything's great. Just one tiny glitch. - Dr. Singh's not coming. - Oh. All right, fine. - So you're okay with this? - Of course. Serious, mom, that's awesome, because I thought-- - What are you doing?  - Going home. We'll just do this tomorrow when Dr. Singh can be here. I don't think that's how it works, Mrs. D. Oh, come on, the baby's been in here nine months, It can wait another day. Ivy honey, be a dear and jam that shoe onto my foot. Um, mom, please get back in bed. I am not gonna have this baby without Dr. Singh. Okay okay, then we'll go get him. - You will? - We will. Oh, that's so nice. All right, let's roll, Gretel. Oh good, more people get to see me. Yeehaw! New record! Gabe, it's Mrs. Dabney. Open up. I'm not supposed to open the door to strangers. I wish we were strangers. Let me in. What is going on in here? Just the best day of my life. Party's over. Your sister called and asked me to bring you to the hospital. No way. I'm not going just to see some stupid baby Who I don't even want anyway. I see what's going on. Have a seat. I'm gonna tell you a story. When I was four, I got a baby sister. Hated that girl from the first minute I laid eyes on her. I used to pull her hair And call her names and tease her till she cried. But we grew up and one thing led to another And after all these years I still can't stand her. How is that supposed to make me feel better? I didn't say it was going to make you feel better. I said I was going to tell you a story. Now take that helmet off and let's go. What did you do to your head? Gave myself a haircut. You like it? I want it documented that that happened before I got here. Wait wait wait wait, no, hey hey. All right, time out. Dr. Singh? Oh, it's about time. I-- Wait a minute. I ordered Batman. Not Frankenstein and Goldilocks? Close enough. No, we're not here for the party. You delivered me. I think I would have remembered that. I'm Teddy, Amy Duncan's daughter. She's about to give birth - And needs you at the hospital. - I can't leave. I have to stay here and enjoy my son's birthday. Who threw that? Was it you, Tyler? Or the other Tyler? No no no no no. No no no. How about we make a deal, okay? If you go to the hospital and take care of my mom, Then we'll stay here and entertain the kids. And how are we gonna do that? We'll do my play for them. Oh, it's a delightful fable about people from different worlds Who overcome their differences and become friends. I give it two thumbs up. Good luck. Hey, kids, who wants to see a play, huh? That is a yes from Tyler. Hey! If Gretel gets hit with a football, There's gonna be one less Tyler at this party. This should be good. We just drove 40 miles behind a truck Loaded with live chickens on motorcycles. The chickens weren't on motorcycles. We were. - You must be the Duncans. - How'd you know that? Wild guess. In there. Oh, uh, thanks for dropping us off. We can handle it from here. Oh, we can't leave now. We're emotionally invested. And I need to grab a quick shower. She's not kidding. I can't believe you threw up in my car. What did you expect? For lunch I ate two cans of frosting. We're looking for Amy Duncan. We know the Duncans. Good enough for me. - I like your hair. - Thanks. I like your scar. Hello, is anyone home in this gingerbread house? Frankenstein? What are you doing in German Switzerland? Me want friend. But how can a big monster like you Be friends with a sweet little peasant girl like me? It's possible. If you believe We can be friends, clap hands. Clap hands! Like this! T, give it up. What are you doing? Stick to the script. Look at them. They're bored silly. Let's just stop. No, we can't. Frankenstein hasn't found the courage to cry yet. Sorry, Frankie, Gretel's taking over. Hey, kids, who wants to play pin the tail on the Frankenstein? Me me me! That's a picture of our son Hog. His name's Hog? It was. He changed it to Kevin. The boy's been a real disappointment. - Is he like a criminal or something? - Worse. Vice president of marketing. - First baby? - That obvious, huh? Hey, I've been there. - You have? - Oh yeah. - This is my third time sitting in these chairs. - Wow. If you don't mind my asking, - How old were you the first time? - Two. - Has mom given birth yet? - Nope. - Hey, Teddy. - What happened to your hair? I'm conditioning. You're Teddy? You're exactly like Gabe described you. Hey, kids, come on. There's somebody I want you to meet. Hi. Come in, come in. Say hello to your new baby sister, everybody. Her name is Charlotte. Do you want to hold her, Teddy? - Can I? - Of course. She's beautiful. Hi there. Nice to meet you. And I don't usually look like this. I can't believe I have a baby sister. Would you mind taking a picture? Thank you. - What's the baby's name? - Charlotte. - Mama, can we call her Charlie? - Charlie! Oh, I love it. Quite a family you got there. Good luck, Charlie. Sweetie, I just love this present. Oh, thanks, mom. But to be fair, P. J. And Gabe set the bar pretty low. - What?! - Hey. Surprise. Oh, mad dog, Francis, Come on in. What are you guys doing here? We have a birthday present for our goddaughter. A baby biker vest. Let's try it on. That's so cute. I love it. Did you ask them to be the godparents? Of course not. Then you have to tell them that they are not the godparents. No thank you. Fine, I'll do it. Excuse me. There's something I have to tell you. Oh, welcome to the family. Guys, check it out. - Ohhh! - Cutie. I know I heard something. I think it's coming from the kitchen. Okay, you wait here. Or I could hide upstairs. You're here for the egg salad, aren't you? Okay, sit down. You bring back my truck? Full tank of gas? What, were you raised in a cave?
Hey, Charlie! It's your big sister Teddy with the latest installment of my video diary. Teddy, turn that thing off. It's breakfast time. In a minute! That noise you hear is our neighbor's annoying new dog. Ever since she got that little rat, none of us have gotten any sleep. Teddy, I asked you to do something. And I asked for a minute! Your breakfast is getting cold. Well, then just put it back in the toaster! Sorry you had to see that. There is no prize in here. There's supposed to be a prize. You took it out yesterday. I know, but I put it back in so I'd have something to look forward to. Bob, where are you? Can I have a minute?! Well, hurry up! You're missing quality family time! Gabe, stop hitting the toaster. But it's taking forever. I don't even remember what I put in here. Okay, Charlie, I will get you your juice in just a minute, honey. Whoa! Even Charlie's in a mood. Morning. Bob, did you forget to do something? I'll kiss you tonight. No. You only shaved half your face. Pick, pick, pick. Maybe this is how I like to wear it now. Well, it looks ridiculous. What if I decided just to brush half my hair? I thought you already made that decision. Oh, you are going down! Wait! Stop! Stop! Do you guys hear that? I don't hear anything. Exactly. The barking stopped. - Oh, come on!  - Really? Today's all burnt toast{\i0} Running late, and dad jokes{\i0} Has anybody seen my left shoe{\i0} I close my eyes, take a bite{\i0} Grab a ride, laugh out loud{\i0} There it is up on the roof{\i0} I've been there, I've survived{\i0} So just take my advice{\i0} Hang in there, baby,{\i0} Things are crazy{\i0} But I know your future is bright{\i0} Hang in there, Baby{\i0} There is no maybe{\i0} Eveything turns out all right{\i0} Sure life is up and down{\i0} But trust me, it comes back all around{\i0} You're gonna love who you turn out to be{\i0} Hang in there, Baby{\i0} Well, at least Charlie's getting some sleep. Why did Mrs. Dabney have to get that stupid dog, anyway? Why couldn't she get something that made less noise Like a fish? Fish don't make any noise. I wish you were a fish. Can we all agree that thing is a pest? Because as an exterminator, it is my job To take care of pests. When you say take care of, I know you actually mean kill. Which I'm totally fine with, by the way. I'll just go over to Mrs. Dabney's and demand She keep the dog in at night. Or we could just try being friendly. Friendly? With Mrs. Dabney? What is this, crazy idea day? Okay, look, I am serious. How about I invite her over tonight for a cup of coffee and I bake a pie? I thought you wanted this to go well. Okay, we'll have Mrs. Dabney over, but I want everybody on their best behavior, especially you, mister. I don't think I have a best behavior. Yeah, well, you'd better find one before tonight. In her defense, Mrs. Dabney wasn't always like this. She actually used to be kind of nice. When was that? Let's see, how old are you? All right, got my pie. What do you want? We don't want anything, Mrs. Dabney. Yeah, we're just being neighborly. What did he do? I didn't do anything. I don't like you, Gabe. But I like you, Mrs. Dabney. In fact, I'd like to take care of you. Out. Mrs. Dabney, so you have a new dog A little chihuahua. So that's what this is about. It's not not what this is about. Dog's got a name Hercules. That's funny because Hercules is like so big and strong And your dog is so Just being neighborly. Look, the thing is, Hercules has a tendency to bark A lot All night long. Right, so we were wondering if maybe you could bring him in before bedtime. Oh, no! Fresh air's good for dogs. Well, sleep is good for people. I had that same thought After every one of your many babies arrived. We were talking about the dog. Well, since we're airing our grievances We begged her not to make that pie. I was gonna say that maybe there's a little something You can do for me. Oh, Mrs. Dabney, we've already told you, We're not sending Gabe to military school. But if it's a deal-breaker, we are willing to send him To other places. I was talking about your oak tree out back. There's a branch that hangs over my yard Always dropping acorns and making a big mess. Well, no problem. Dog goes in, branch comes off. We got a deal? We have a deal. Dad, that branch holds our treehouse. Well, so what? You kids haven't been up there in years. I'm confused. Is Gabe going somewhere or not? You know, if that treehouse comes down, That'll be even better More sunlight for my vegetable garden. Start eating healthier Might even make my goal Of living to be 100. Mrs. Dabney, don't you want to stay and finish your pie? You have a good night, now. She's gone? But I didn't get my hug. Well, at least we'll finally be able to get some sleep. Too bad we have to lose our treehouse. We have a treehouse? Yeah. Teddy and I used to go up there all the time when we were little. Yeah, we had so much fun up there. Are you kidding me? All you two ever did up there was fight. That's not how I remember it. We had great times. Yeah, I mean, except for, you know, all those times That you fell out the window. Oh, I enjoyed those too. How did I not know we had a treehouse? Well, cause it's kind of overgrown. I built it that summer we went to Hawaii. You guys went to Hawaii?! Yeah. We used to do all kinds of fun stuff. When did that stop? Well, how old are you? Check it out, Charlie. Here's our old treehouse. Oh, look. Here's your old tea party set And all our board games. Oh! Wait And look at this. These are the Chinese handcuffs That pj always used to get stuck in. Uh A little help? Oh! Baby booboo! Oh my goodness, I thought I lost her. It's been so many years. And those years have not been kind. Yeah, I remember. I used to come up here And pretend booboo was a real baby. I was a very good mother, huh? Until you left your baby in a treehouse for 10 years. Oh, whoa, look! Here's something you carved into the wall. P. J. hearts P. B. Who's P. B. ?. Peanut butter. It was a simpler time. You know what stinks? When they premix it with the jelly. No, it stinks that Charlie's never gonna get to use this treehouse. She'd probably love it up here. Hey, kids! Come on down now! P. J. , we have to save this place for Charlie. Well, I wish we could, but Dad made a deal. Yeah well, deals are made to be broken. Right! The golden rule! - Hey, kids!  - Hey, Dad! We changed our minds. We don't want to lose the treehouse after all. It's too late. I already shook hands on it. Well, can we at least talk about this? Yeah, maybe take a family vote? This isn't a democracy, guys. And by the way, even if it was, The guy with the chainsaw Always wins. Come on. Come on down. No! No? No, we're not leaving. Yeah! We're staying right here. We're fighting the power! Get down here now or you're grounded! You can't ground someone who's not actually on the ground. Yeah! Right on, P. J. Fight the power!. You know what? Good luck fighting the power saw! You're coming down one way or another! No, we are not, okay? We have history on our side! We are going to protest peacefully Like gandhi and martin luther king. He had a dream. Yeah well, I got a dream too, Teddy To get some sleep! You're not scaring us. No! We laugh at you! All right, you know what? I'm done messing around. I'm bringing out the big guns. That's right Mom! You go get Mom. Yeah, she doesn't scare us! This is bad, he's getting Mom. Lock her up. Go out there and get your kids out of that tree. Okay, why are they always my kids when they won't do what you want? They're having some kind of sit-in to try and save the treehouse. Now, I appreciate that they're taking a stand. I just don't like that it's against me! Would you calm down? But I'm the father! I'm in charge around here! When you're not home. Honey, you are getting upset over nothing. This is Teddy and P. J. We're talking about. They can't be in the same room for five minutes Without getting into a fight. They won't last an hour up there. All right. But when they come down, they're getting punished for defying me! If that's okay with you. I'm tired. I'm cold. How much longer can we keep this up? We've been up here for 12 minutes. If I had known we were gonna protest, I would have prepared. For one thing, I wouldn't have had That extra-large root beer. All right, let's just stay focused on why we're here For Charlie. That doesn't help. Charlie gets to pee whenever she wants - Which is why my idea - Okay, please don't tell me About diaper-for-teens again. Hey, Gabe. Hey. So, this is the famous treehouse I never knew about. Want to join our sit-in? It's just like when Gandhi and Billie Jean King teamed up to stop the civil war. Almost every word in that sentence was wrong. What do you say, Gabe? Are you in? I'm in. - Great.  - Yeah! But first, you'll need to bring us some supplies, Just the essentials. Snacks, my video games, my guitar Whoa, dude, this is a sit-in, Not a move-in. Oh! And some peanut butter. Yeah, that's right, the love affair continues. Well, I'll be back. What are you doing? I'm gonna join the sit-in. I have to do what's right. How about I take you out for ice cream instead? I'll be in the car. What was that crazy card game We used to play with all the eights? Crazy eights. No Where is Gabe with the snacks? Now I'm getting hungry. So hungry. I keep thinking I smell steak cooking. Yeah, me too. Really? Oh, hey! Don't mind me Just making dinner for my family You know, the ones on the ground. Yeah, okay. We know what you're doing And it's not gonna work. Well, suit yourself.

You'll never get the T-Bone. Go for the filet. I think I got it. I got it! I got it! I have never loved you more than Idiot! I think somebody overcooked their fishing pole. This looks more medium well. I'm so hungry! And there's nothing to eat up here. Or is there? Acorns Acorns are food, right? For squirrels. How do squirrels do this. Well, they're squirrels. You know what? I can't take this anymore. I'm done. Wait, no! You're just giving up? That is so like you! What is so like me? To be a quitter. Yeah? Well, you're bossy! I am not bossy!

Are you quitting? What? You know, like, If I pull you back in, will you keep doing the sit-in? Since my alternative is a face-first dive into a hot barbecue Yes! One more thing. You have to drive me wherever I want to go For the next month. Deal. Now pull me up,my face is browning. Okay. Thank you for saving me. No problem. Although, you wouldn't have had to save me If you didn't push me out of a treehouse! Whoa whoa whoa! Hey hey! Stop! Whoa! Truce! Truce! Gosh, what is wrong with us? We're going at it like seven-year-olds. Mom was right. We did fight up here all the time, didn't we? Yes, and nothing's changed. We're still doing it. Is this the way it's always gonna be between us? I hope not. I don't want to be sitting on the porch Of our old folks' home whacking each other With foam bats. Oh, do we have to live in the same old folks' home? P. J. , if we can't come together. And do this one thing for Charlie, We're never gonna come together on anything. You're right. We can do this For Charlie. For Charlie. So What do you want to do now? I don't know. I wish we could hurry up and save this treehouse So we could get the heck out of this treehouse. They're still up in that tree. You said they'd be down by now. Well, I thought they would be. Why is there a plastic hook in my steak? Eat around it. You know, when you think about it, This is actually kind of nice. I mean, Teddy and P. J. Are finally working together on something. I'm proud of them. Whose side are you on, Ours or the rebels? The rebels? Okay, you realize We're not actually at war, right? Of course I do. For that to happen, someone would have to issue A formal declaration of war Which should almost be done printing out. Bob, they're doing exactly what we taught them to do. They're standing up for what they believe in. Well, you know what? Now we're going to teach them Don't mess with Daddy. Gabe, go get your water balloon launcher. Okay. Gabe, sit. Bob, you're taking this too far. No I'm not. And I gave you an order, mister. Gabe, stand down. Sorry, Dad, but I'm a little more afraid of Mom. Fine. I'll fight this battle myself. Hey, sweetheart, you're not really afraid of me, are you? A little. Good. I'm giving you one last chance to come down! Okay! All right! I don't like doing this, but you've forced my hand! Oh, come on! So lucky! You got so lucky! You know what? Next one's coming right through the window! Oh, yeah? Take that! What are you doing? Fightin' the power! But we're the power. The kids are right. This treehouse is worth saving. What is going on over here? You know, this really isn't a good time, Mrs. Dabney. You'd better get a handle on that family of yours 'Cause right now, it looks like they're kicking your butt. Would you let me deal with this, please? You'd better, cause hercules is getting kinda lonely. I'm thinking of getting another dog. Are you threatening me? This one's gonna be female Might even have some puppies. That's right. You go get them down. Time to put on the big pants! He's coming up. We have to stop him. Hold your fire! Careful, This could be a trick. I come in peace. I've come to join the resistance. All right! Yeah! That's right, Mrs. Dabney! I don't care about your dog! Oh, the big pants are on And they're staying up here with my family. We did it! Yes! You can have a treehouse, Charlie. For a long long time. What was that? Wait, have we ever all been up here at the same time? Is everyone okay? - Yeah - I think so. Whoa, look! Oh, hon! Was that so hard? Yeah. Well, the treehouse is down. So, you're gonna be bringing your dog in tonight, right? Oh, hercules doesn't belong to me. I was just dogsitting for a couple of days. I'm a cat person And an excellent negotiator. Do not throw that balloon. We're gonna launch that balloon, mister. Dad! Well, Charlie, Dad and the boys Are building you a new treehouse. So someday you can go up there and play with baby booboo, You know, just as soon as we find her head. Right now, she's baby tennis ball. Yeah! No, not as much fun. Oh, and I want to recommend that you make the treehouse No boys allowed Especially if that boy weighs as much as Dad, because if you do let him up there, well, good luck, Charlie. What are you doing? Gabe says he's more scared of Mom than he is of me. So I'm going to scare him. Hey, Dad! Gabe, honey, did you finish your homework? Ah Mummy mom. You'd got it all you don't.

Bob, wait. I forgot to tell you something. It's about your Uncle Mel he called. I don't wanna hear it. Oh, come on! He begged me to pass on the message. Thank you, and now I'm going to pass on the message. Who's Uncle Mel? Somebody you'll never know. He's your father's uncle. Okay, so you told me about Uncle Stanley Who knits sweaters for his cats, But you didn't want to tell me about Uncle Mel? Because, Teddy, if you don't have Anything nice to say about someone, Then don't say anything at all. And Mel's an idiot. Okay, mom, tell me about Uncle Mel. Well, he and your father had Some kind of falling out. That's all I know. Isn't there some way we can find out more? This is the first interesting thing about dad since Well, this is the first interesting thing about dad. Honey, trust me. I've learned the hard way: When it comes to Duncan family drama, Stay out.

Who knew? She's actually good for something Besides drooling and pooping. Walter Louper photography. Specializing in dogs, cats and babies. Forget it. I'm not exploiting my baby. But we don't have a dog or a cat. Mom, come on. This could be a big break for Charlie. P. J. , Charlie is not getting a job before you do. Well, the photographer didn't offer to shoot me. Ha. You don't have to have a modeling job. Any job will do. Come here. Man, this conversation sure took an ugly turn. Anyway, we will not be needing this. I knew we should've done it my way. What was your way? We don't tell mom we're doing the photo shoot, We go ahead and do it anyway and split the money. When did you come up with that? At the park. I told you when The girls' cross-country team ran by. Oh, yeah! What were we talking about again? Hi, Charlie. Teddy here. So it turns out there's a Duncan family mystery. Yeah, yesterday I found out we have an Uncle Mel. Does this look good on me? Well, only if you pull your pants over your face, because that is a belt. We need to go to the mall today.

Something went down between my dad and his Uncle Mel And I have to know what happened. What is this? Oh, that's a credit card my dad gave me a while ago. And I'm just now hearing about this? Well, it's for emergencies only. Honey, I've seen your closet. It is an emergency. Okay. Well, if you go to the rest home with me, I will go to the mall with you. Okay, but I have to warn you: My grandpa was in a rest home And it was depressing. He'd just sit there And complain about how nobody ever came to visit. Finally, I just stopped going.

What happened between you and dad. After this inning. Hot stuff coming through. Ivy! Ivy, what is all this? It's your fault for giving me a credit card. Right. The emergency credit card.

Hey, control your grandpa! He's scaring my kids. Hey, your kids stink. Sorry. He didn't mean that. I'm sure your kids smell awesome. Okay, Uncle Mel, why don't you just sit down And enjoy a nice, quiet hot dog? I'd love a hot dog. Hey, weiner, have a weiner! No! Are you gonna do something about him or should I? Yeah, I said I'd handle it and it would be a lot easier without your helpful suggestions. Oh, well, here's a helpful suggestion: Take him out of here or I take you out of here. Oh, you shouldn't have said that, 'cause now Ivy's about to get out of her chair. T, hold my ring. Okay, can we all just chill? Hey, losers! Get a load of this! No! Oh no, we're on the jumbo screen. Are we almost done? 'cause if not, we're kinda getting into overtime. Is that a problem? Not for us. But for mom. I think it's gonna cost you. Exactly what I was thinking, little brother. I'm gonna run this by the boss Mom. What are you doing here? I live here. But you're not supposed to be back yet. Well, I finished everything I needed to do got the car washed, Did the grocery shopping, went to the bank. What is that flashing coming from the living room?

Yeah, the camera loves you. You two are so grounded. Then the police politely asked us to leave, At which point Uncle Mel invited them to kiss something That had been on the jumbo screen. Oh, good. All right. Now you know why I wanted you to stay away from your Uncle Mel. The guy's a maniac, especially when it comes to baseball. Yeah, that would've been useful information. You know what? Just go to bed. I really don't want to talk about this anymore. Well, there is one more thing I should tell you about Uncle Mel. Yeah? What's that? He's in the living room. What?! You have to talk to him. No, I don't. I don't. I've got nothing to say to him. What is this all about, anyway? Why won't anybody tell me? Because it's ancient history. All right? It's done. It's forgotten about. I've moved on. Now get that old fart out of my house! Be right back. So dad says welcome. He doesn't want to talk to me, does he? Well, I don't want to talk to him either! And you can tell him I said that. I'll be right back. Uncle Mel says he loves you. Really? Uncle Mel said that? Yeah, he said something like that. It's so long since I've been in the living room. Well, when is he gonna leave the living room? Okay, Uncle Mel wants to sort this thing out. Maybe you should start. I think he should start. I'll be right back. Dad says he loves you. Hogwash! And he thinks it would help if you told me what this feud was about. When your father was 10 years old, I was his baseball coach. Oh. Now I get it. What's that supposed to mean? Well, you get a little bit too excited about baseball. I share my opinions! Anyway, I gave him some constructive criticism You said I swung like a girl! I was sugar-coating it! You swung like a baby girl! Hey, we're talking. This is a start. You humiliated me in front sof the entire team. I was trying to make you better. Well, you didn't yell at any of the other kids. Because I didn't care about any of the other kids, fathead! Whoa. Did you hear that? Before the fathead part. He said he cared about you. I was trying to make you tough And I guess sometimes I got a little carried away. I'm sorry. We have an apology. Hey, dad. Well, maybe sometimes I was a little oversensitive And I'm sorry. And a return apology. Now you know what we do in this family after we fight? I'm hoping eat. We hug. Hugging's for girls. Baby girls. That's I gotta tinkle. Be back in 20 minutes. Right over there. Come here. You did good, kid. Thank you. Yeah, well,you guys are always saying how important family is. Yes. Yes, it is. He just walked into the'? I'm afraid so. Hey, Mel, That's not a bathroom.

About that I talked to Gabe And turns out he kinds of likes you too. He does? Why are you clenching your fist? I feel like punching someone. Okay well we need to work on how you express yourself with boys. Why don't we try a little role-playing okay? I'll be Gabe. You'll be you. Okay. So let's pretend we run into each other at school. - Hi Jo. - Hi gabe. I like your jacket. Well somebody knows karate. Sorry. It was a reflex. Let me try again. Okay but this time Let's keep our hands to ourselves okay? Got it. Okay. Hi Jo. Hi Gabe. Want to sit with me at lunch? Yah! I see you found a loophole. You didn't say anything about the feet. And now you've learned the word loophole. Now try this time With no hands and no feet Or anything else you could hit me with. Got it. Hi Jo. You look nice. Very good Jo. You clenched your fist and then you unclenched. That is called progress. Feels weird without hitting But I kind of like it. What is she doing here? No no it's okay. You have nothing to worry about. Right Jo? Right. Hey Gabe. You look nice. What? She gave you a compliment. Say something nice back. Uh Your hair looks softer than your fists? Thanks. Why don't you two hang out for a while? I'll be upstairs trying to decide If I should apply ice or heat. So what do you like to do? I like monster trucks Mixed martial arts and dolls. You like video games? What do you got? Galaxy of Death. Is it violent? Level two comes with the barf bags. It's really fun. You had me at barf bag. Hey what are you doing here? I'm between deliveries But I really wanted to say something to you. First I'm like totally psyched that you're my girlfriend. Great. Anything else? Well yeah. I was just thinking That we should be spending a little less time together You know so we still have time for friends. Works for me. Not starting right now. Madison what's going on? Nothing. Gotta get to work babe. Who's that? Nobody. See you later babe. Nice hat. Thanks. You too. Who was that? Just the pizza delivery guy. Really? Don't they usually deliver pizzas To your house not from your house? I don't And don't they usually not kiss the customers And call them babe? You were cheating on me with Pizza Pirate. No actually I was cheating on Pizza Pirate With kwikki chikki. That's it. We're through. Are you breaking up with me? Unless you promise never to see him again. Yeah we should probably break up. He gave me a whole bunch of coupons. Get off me! Help! Ow! Jo what are you doing? This is not the way to express yourself. This is not about me liking Gabe. This is about him cheating at Galaxy of Death. I didn't cheat. Get this whacko off me! Come on Jo get off him. Let go. Let go. Whoa! You want some of this? Hey Charlie. Well today was a bad day for the Duncan kids. We learned that sometimes love hurts. No kidding. Jo dislocated my shoulder. Madison dislocated my heart. Well maybe love gets easier as we get older. Honey it's no Kitty-kat but at least it's a nickname. Amy-potomus? Well when you say it like that Or maybe love never gets easier. Then again you might be the one to figure that out. Good luck with that Charlie. Hi. Heard about your breakup. Who told you? I saw you change your online status From in a relationship to dumped. Bring it here. It hurts so much. I know. Emmett's here. Let it out. And ignore my last voicemail. - What? - No no no no. Hey Gabe. Nice backpack. What do you want Jo? I think I was pretty clear. I want your backpack. No. I'm sorry did you just say no? You heard me. You're not bullying me anymore. What you're gonna sic your sister on me again? I'm not afraid of her. I have more than one sister. And that's after only one karate lesson.
Hey, Charlie, check this out. Here's something nobody has ever seen before. Gabe is brushing his hair Do you have to videotape everything we do? This isn't a reality show. Oh, I know it's not reality because he took a shower without being asked. You know what I think? I think you like someone. What if I do? No big deal. Are you kidding? Your first crush is a huge deal. Look, she is a girl. I'm a guy. These things happen every day. Not to you. I know. Can you believe it? Hey, kids, come on, let's go. P. J. Honey, can you watch charlie after school?. I have to work. I can't. I'm working too. I can take charlie with me if you want. You want to help your big brother deliver chicken? Or you could come to the hospital And help mommy change bedpans. You take her. Gabe, are you wearing aftershave? A little. Why would you do that? You're not shaving yet. As long as we're being logical, why do you still have a comb? Get in the car. Today's all burnt toast{\i0} Running late, and dad jokes{\i0} Has anybody seen my left shoe{\i0} I close my eyes, take a bite{\i0} Grab a ride, laugh out loud{\i0} There it is up on the roof{\i0} I've been there, I've survived{\i0} So just take my advice{\i0} Hang in there, baby,{\i0} Things are crazy{\i0} But I know your future is bright{\i0} Hang in there, Baby{\i0} There is no maybe{\i0} Eveything turns out all right{\i0} Sure life is up and down{\i0} But trust me, it comes back all around{\i0} You're gonna love who you turn out to be{\i0} Hang in there, Baby{\i0} Okay, this is my chance. Don't blow it. Say something to her. H-h-hi, Kit. Hellllooo, Kit! Yo yo yo, Kit! My mouth's so dry. I need juice. It's juice. This is not pee. That went well. Is your sister home? Yes. Who was that? Mrs. Dabney with her stupid questions. I have a follow-up question-- May I speak to your sister? What can I do for you, mrs. Dabney? I'm going out of town for a couple of days And I was wondering if y'd be kind enough to look after my cat Caboodle. Oh, I don't know. I'm awfully busy. I'll pay you $20 a day. My schedule just opened up. Mm-hmm. I can trust you, right? Of course. You do seem to be the least disturbed of all the Duncan kids. What an almost sweet thing to say. You need to know that Caboodle Is the most important thing in the world to me. How's mr. Dabney doing? Like I said, love that Caboodle. Who is it? Kwikki Chikki. Oh, hello. Hi, it's $21. 07. Oh, okay. Who is this cutie pie? I'm p. J. I meant the other cutie pie. Oh, this is Charlie. She's my baby sister. Why, isn't she the most precious thing in the whole world? Yeah, my mom's at the hospital, so I'm looking after her. Oh, you poor dear. Keep the change. Are you sure? This is almost a $20 tip. Oh, you need it more than I do, What with your mom being in the hospital and all. Oh, you think my mom is in-- I'm not gonna lie to you. It's been hard. Enjoy your chicken. Charlie, welcome to the chicken delivery business. Give him dry food twice a day And make sure his water bowl is always filled. Oh, and my sister Virginia is coming by later for a play date. You want me to have a play date with your sister? Not you-- Caboodle. Virginia brings her cat Stanley over. What a ridiculous name for a cat. Caboodle? Stanley Oh, I should go. But so my little Caboodie won't make a scene, You need to distract him. Should I pretend to be a mouse? Yes. I was joking. I wasn't. The cat seems fine to me. I'm paying you. Now put him down and act like a mouse. Squeak squeak. You can do better than that. Bare your teeth, wiggle your nose And act like you're eating a piece of cheese. Now keep doing that for 20 minutes, And he should be fine. Goodbye, my Caboodle. Teddy honey, did you lose something? Only my dignity. Mom, can you help me with something? Sure, honey. What can I do for you? Well, I have this friend And he needs to know how to talk to girls. Does this friend have a name? No-orman. No-orman. That's an odd name. Well, I think he's from No-orway. Gabe honey, I'm your mom. You don't have to be embarrassed About telling me about your first crushy-wushy. I'm just gonna go look it up on the internet. No no no, it's okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, so what have you said to her so far? Um, I said, that was juice, not pee. And then she walked away. Oh, no-orman. Every time I get near her, My heart starts pounding, my hands get all sweaty And I can't speak. Oh, you've got it bad. I remember my first crush. Was it dad? Sure, why not? So what do I do? How do I talk to her? Well, when you start to get a little nervous, Just ask her questions. Let her do the talking. Find things you have in common. So just ask her stuff and listen to the answers? That sounds easy. Sure. Relationships are a piece of cake. That's why married people are always so happy. Did dad ever get nervous talking to you? Oh, when your dad and I first started dating We didn't do a lot of talking. Mostly we just-- Just what? Played checkers-- Lots and lots of checkers. Hey, dad. Hey. You're taking care of Charlie tomorrow afternoon, right? I believe I am. You know, I was thinking maybe she should come to work with me. Why? Because I feel I didn't do enough to help out When Teddy and Gabe were babies. Enough? You didn't do anything. I know. And it haunts me. It haunts you? Yes. That's why I have to make it up to you with Charlie. Okay. I'll miss you, dad. Oh, that boy's up to something. I should probably get into this. Eh, he's all the way upstairs. Listen and find things in common. Listen and find things in common. - Hi. - Hi. Tell me about yourself. Why? I mean, only if you want to. Okay, what do you want to know? Tell me about your family. Oh, the family. Actually there's not much to tell. I'm an only child. Me too. Cool. What else? Well, my parents are divorced. Mine too. Who do you live with? Who do you live with? My mom. Me too. Wow, we really have a lot in common. You know, I had a feeling we might. Want half of a peanut-butter sandwich? No, thanks. I'm allergic to peanuts. Me too. You dnt do much, do you? Hey hey, catch. Or stay. Good cat. Mrs. Dabney, why are you back here? Oh, I'm not Estelle. I'm her sister Virginia. Wow, you really look like Mrs. Dabney. Except for my laugh lines. Estelle doesn't have any of those. Gabe, this is mrs. Dabney's twin sister Virginia. This is my brother gabe. Oh, you look like a nice little boy. Would you like some candy? Only if you eat one first. You're as cute as the dickens. Okay, this is dang freaky. Okay, Stanley. Let's go play with Caboodle. Here we go. Uh-oh. What's wrong? Caboodle always gets excited when Stanley arrives. He's just been lying on the couch all day. Do you think he's sick? You'd better hope not. I'd hate to be in your shoes If something happened to my sister's baby. Well, it's not my fault. She'd understand that, right? Oh, yeah. She's very understanding. Come on, caboodle, perk up. This does not look good. Oh, I know what will cheer you up-- Mr. Mouse, right? This does not look good either. The whole family's pitching in to help out with Charlie, Because my mom's in the hospital. Thank you. And thank you. Used to be her Halloween costume, But with mom in the hospital, We can't afford to buy her a winter coat-- A new winter coat. Is your mom any better? The same, But we're trying to be brave. You poor thing. Aww. It's hardest on the little ones. Whenever we visit mom in the hospital, Charlie does this. Mama mama mama. Warren, get out here! And bring your wallet! Thanks for coming on such short notice, Dr. Tushy. It's pronounced Tushy. you don't have to thank me. Caboodle Dabney is one of my favorite patients. I didn't know veterinarians made house calls. Oh, they don't. I'm a therapist. A therapist for cats? And birds. But never at the same time. You only make that mistake once. Uh-huh. Huh. Oh. So what's wrong with caboodle? Well, his aura is off. His chakras are out of line. How's his poop? Fine. How's yours? Well, that's a little personal, But since you ask, super good and getting better. Maybe we should get back to the cat, Dr. Tushy. It's Tushy. Tushy. Huh-uh, tushy. Tushy? Tushy Tushy Tushy. Do you have a first name? Tish. Tish Tushy? Doctor. Anyway, can you fix him? No. But you can. Caboodle is feeling abandoned. He needs to know he's safe and secure. Now close your eyes and send him a thought To let him know you care. Can't you give him a shot or--? Send him a thought. Send him a thought. Send him a thought. Do you have a thought? Oh, I'm having a few of them. Kit. Hi, Gabe. What are you doing here? I told my mom all about you And we just wanted to say hi. Yeah, it is so wonderful that Kit met someone With a family just like ours. Okay. Do you mind if we come in? Yeah, sure, I guess. Okay. You know, I'll actually be right back. Okay. I have a big problem. What are you doing? I'm readjusting caboodle's aura. Duh. I'm in big trouble. What's wrong? The girl I like is here with her mom. What's wrong with that? I told her mom and dad are divorced And I'm an only child. What am I gonna do? Okay, the first thing you're gonna do is calm down. Your negative energy is upsetting the cat. You gotta help me. Okay, relax, Or later you're gonna have trouble with your poop. Teddy. Fine, I'll go and get rid of them. Wait, they can't know you're my sister. Right, so I will be somebody else. Hi, I'm Teddy, the housekeeper.  See? Hi, I'm Dana. This is Kit. Why are you wearing a cat? Because in my country we have a saying the house looks its best when a cat's on your chest. What country is that? Canada. Mrs. Duncan isn't home and I have a house to clean, So as we say in my country, oot. oot oot. Okay, could you just tell her we stopped by? You betcha. Hey, everybody. Who's that? That's the chicken delivery guy. Dude, what's with the cat? None of your business. And don't call me dude, chicken delivery guy. Now come out to the porch Where I will teach you how to use a doorbell. You know what's weird? He didn't have any chicken. He's just here to take our order. Then another guy comes and delivers it. It's not a good system. I'm the chicken delivery guy. See? That is such an adorable baby. Is she--? Part of the promotion. Right, P. J. ,. Which may or may not be your name? That's right. A promotion. Kwikki chikki is introducing Baby back ribs. And they make you carry around a baby? That comes from corporate. They have no idea what it's like out in the field. Look who's here. Who is here? Hi, I'm Bob. The exterminator. Yeah, I'm a little more than that. Why are you wearing a cat? Oh, forget the cat. There is a skunk in the backyard And I demand you go exterminate it right now. What are you talking about? Skunks don't come out during the day. Well, then go out and tell him that. Sorry about that. He does good work, but he's a little chatty. Mom? No! Well, hello to you too. Hello. Hi, I'm Dana. I'm Kit's mom. I'm Amy. This baby is so cute. Isn't she? She sure makes me want some baby back ribs. Beg pardon? No skunk back there. Oh, hey, sweetie. Hey. Wow, you're very friendly with the exterminator. I do sleep next to him every night. I didn't realize you had a boyfriend. She's got a what? The exterminator is your boyfriend. The exterminator is my husband. So you remarried? I was never divorced. Well, Kit told me you were. Because that's what gabe told me. I may have told a teeny little lie. Sorry. I just wanted you to like me. Gabe, you should have just told me the truth. I know. And I promise, From now on I'll always be completely honest with you. I'm back. Now who's this? That's either virginia who's nice and gives out candy Or Mrs. Dabney-- her evil twin. We're out of here. Well, Charlie, the good news is Caboodle's fine. Turns out all he needed was a trip to the litter box. But the bad news is Gabe's romance with Kit is over. Well, the good news is I don't have to shower anymore. That's really good news. So if your brother gabe goes to give you a hug, Well, good luck, Charlie. Don't worry. That won't happen. Hey, mom, Charlie and I have to work a double tomorrow. What? Why do you keep taking Charlie to work? Because I love her. Nobody? May I help you? I just wanted to drop off this casserole. Excuse me? Well, with P. J. 's mom being in the hospital. And him practically having to raise Charlie on his own-- It's just so sad. You think-- Gosh, that smells good. It is sad. - I find when people are in need-- - Thank you. Kids, dinner's ready. It's open. There's another one? There's another one? What? I don't know. We're the world famous quintuplets, Wisconsin. We were the biggest news story of 1958. This was supposed to be a family reunion. What happened? Estelle kicked us out. That woman's not right. Tell me about it!
All right, class. These progress reports will let you know how you're doing in English so far, and for many of you I use the word progress loosely. Please let it be an A. Please let it be an A. Please let it be a C. Please let it be a C. Mr. Gerkin, the fast food industry is booming and offers a bright future. This is great. This is terrible. I got a B. So did I. I can't believe I got a real B. As opposed to what? A D that I have to write another D on top of to make it look like a B. Mr. Dingwall, can I ask you a quick question? You just did. Goodbye. No, actually it's about my grade. I was kind of expecting an A. A the same letter that begins the words annoying and adios. Can you just explain to me why I got a B? English is my best subject. Although my math and science teachers would argue with that. Here's another one-- aloha. Today's all burnt toast{\i0} Running late, and dad jokes{\i0} Has anybody seen my left shoe{\i0} I close my eyes, take a bite{\i0} Grab a ride, laugh out loud{\i0} There it is up on the roof{\i0} I've been there, I've survived{\i0} So just take my advice{\i0} Hang in there, baby,{\i0} Things are crazy{\i0} But I know your future is bright{\i0} Hang in there, Baby{\i0} There is no maybe{\i0} Eveything turns out all right{\i0} Sure life is up and down{\i0} But trust me, it comes back all around{\i0} You're gonna love who you turn out to be{\i0} Hang in there, Baby{\i0} Hey, ready for your basketball game? Do I have to go? All we ever do is lose. That is not true. Sometimes you forfeit. Oh, honey, it's important to think positive. True, you've lost 11 games in a row and you're dead last in the league, but-- I don't know where I'm going with this. Bad news, Gabe. I can't coach your game today. Just got an emergency extermination call. What's the big emergency? Ladybug infestation. Aww. Oh, sure, one's cute. Thousands-- unspeakable horror. So I guess without a coach we won't be able to play our game today. Hey, wait a minute. I can coach. That's cute, honey, but coaching's a little more complicated than you might think. Oh, honey, I can lose just as good as you can. What am I saying? I can't coach. I have Mommy & Me with Charlie. I could take Charlie to Mommy & Me. Honey, that's cute, but Mommy & Me is a little more complicated than you might think. Actually, it's really not. You go ahead and take her. All right, honey, looks like you're in. Here's the playbook. Now this might be a little over your head, so just do your best. Xs are our team. Os are the other guys. Okay, the xs have lost 11 games in a row, right? Right. We're gonna be the os this week. Hi, Charlie, it's your big sister Teddy here. Or should I say big failure Teddy? I just wanted to show you how sad I look after I got my first B. And I just want to show you how happy I look when I got my first B. Whoo! Sorry you had to see that. I do not deserve a b. I felt the same way. You know, I know why Dingwall gave me a bad grade. He just doesn't like me. You know, that could be. Whenever he talks to you, he makes a face like somebody just cut one. But it's not fair. I never cut one. It's always Gerkin. So what if Dingwall doesn't like you? Who cares? I care. No one's ever not liked me before. I don't mean to be conceited, but likable people like me are liked. It's just a fact. As long as you're not conceited. I know what I gotta do--get Dingwall to like me. I know what I gotta do-- more dancing. I still got some happy left in me. You'd better watch out if I ever get an A. Hey, dad. Hey, how was Mommy & Me? It was awesome. The moms loved me. I told them some jokes, made them laugh, taught them how to change their ringtones. Did Charlie have a good time? I don't know. I wasn't really watching her. So? How bad was it? It was terrible. It was terrible for the other team because we won! We won. Ooh ooh! I don't believe it. Where's Gabe? He went out for ice cream with the rest of the team, right after they carried me to my car, chanting Amy! Amy! Really, such a fuss. Did the other team just not show up? Oh, they showed up, but they wish they hadn't. Kapow! That's amazing. Actually, it wasn't as hard as you thought. I just told the boys to go out there and have fun. Did you at least use the playbook? Absolutely. The bench was freezing, so I sat on it. Hello. Hey, Angie. Look, I'm sorry I couldn't make it to mommy & me-- you want to talk to p. J. ?. I think he's here. Hang on a sec. P. J. Yeah? Hello. Oh, hey, Ange. Yeah, it was fun hanging out with you too. That's hilarious. Oh no, you didn't. You guys mind? This is kinda personal. By the way, did you see Linda's hair? Right? Hey, there's my winner. Hey, dad. Congratulations. I mean, obviously a fluke, right, happening when your mom was coaching? But you know what? I think we can build on this. Yeah yeah. Dad, we need to talk. What about? Have a seat. Okay. What's up? These things are never easy. What things? Look, the team talked things over and we think it's in everyone's best interest if we make some changes involving the coaching staff. The coaching staff? I'm the coaching staff. Yeah. Oh, wait a minute. Are you firing me? After everything I've done for this team? We wish you the best. Oh, come on. Oh, come on. Hey, give me another chance. I can turn this thing around. I think we're done here. Oh, dad, would you send mom in? I have some good news for her. Hey, Mr. D. Got a little present for you-- some yummy homemade brownies, just cause. School district policy prohibits me from receiving gifts which, judging by these, does not appear to be a tragedy. Well, I thought you might have a sweet tooth like me-- just one more thing we have in common, I mean, besides our ethnic heritage. This should be good. Dingwall is a scottish name, like Duncan. I looked up your family crest. Did you know that it's two eagles in flight? Miss Duncan, let's cut to the chase. You're here about your grade, right? You are one sharp scottish cookie. The issue is your oral book reports. I work very hard on those. They're lifeless and dry, and that's coming from me. Okay, so I'll jazz them up. Find a way to make the book come alive. Put your energy into that instead of kissing up to your teacher, which I find shallow, insulting and-- adorable! What? Honey, come on, let's go. Who-- who-- who is that? Who is that? That's my mom and my sister Charlie. Aren't you the cutest baby ever? We like to think so. And you look just like your mommy. If you're saying I'm the cutest mommy ever, I accept. Teddy dear, I had no idea you had a baby sister. Teddy? Dear? Who is that? Who is that? Who is that? What are you doing? I'm watching my book. For your book report? That's right. Aren't you supposed to, oh, I don't know, read your book? Teddy, get with it. Kids don't read anymore. You're so old school. And if you don't read your book, you're gonna be old and still going to school. Hey. Sorry. I'm just a little upset about my conversation with Mr. Dingwall. He was telling me how boring I was, and then Charlie came in and he lit up like a Christmas tree. Well, there's your answer. To what? To getting an a. You should do your presentation dressed up like a baby. You know what? I might have a better idea. And I'd love to hear it, but the last of the Mohicans just took off his shirt. Gabe. Hey, honey, you coming to Gabe's basketball game? What for? Because you're his father. Or has he fired me from that too? You're still upset about this coaching thing? Of course not. Although according to the by-laws of the Denver junior basketball association, article 17, section 9, the team is not allowed to take a vote and replace me, but I've let it go. Good. Oh. Hi, dad. Gabe. This is awkward. I didn't expect to see you here. In my home? Gabe, honey, Is there something you would like to say to your father? Yeah. Dad, I'm gonna need the whistle. Hey, ange. What are you doing here? It's girls' night out. Oh, you're kidding. Tonight's not good for me. Actually, I'm here to pick up p. J. What's up, girlfriend? Ooh ooh! Are you going out with the moms? Yeah, gonna have some appetizers, maybe do a little karaoke, just let our hair down. Actually, Jeannie rented a chick flick, so we're gonna hang at her place. A chick flick? I'm good to go. Don't wait up. Okay, that's just weird. No, what's weird is that I coach those kids for half a season and-- Oh, let it go, Bob. Are you having fun out there, kiddo? Mom, can you not see the scoreboard? It's 44-12. We're getting creamed. Gabe, over here now. What? We never should have fired your dad. It was your idea. Dude, I was hopped up on ice cream. Well, it's too late now. Or is it? You know what you gotta do. What are you saying? I'm saying it's time to hike up your skirt and fire your mom. Hey, mom, we need to talk. Sure. What's on your mind, honey? These things are never easy. You're firing me, aren't you? Yep. Well, at least one of us is undefeated. Good luck, losers. Hey, dad, old pal, what's goin' on? Let me guess-- coach fun didn't work out, so now you're crawling back to dad. Well, you know what? Maybe I've moved on. Fine. I'll go ask Nick's dad. No no no. I'll do it. I'll do it. Guys, men, come on, gather round. Listen up. All right. We're gonna pull together. We're gonna play as a team. And we're gonna give it our all. And then we'll win? Not a chance. But here's what we can do-- we can go out there and we can lose with dignity. Lose with dignity! Lose with dignity! Yeah! Hey, guys, come on back. It's only halftime. Animal farm by George orwell. Animal farm is a story about what happens when idealistic animals take control of their farm from the evil human owners. Oof. Now I'd like to introduce you to some of the animals. Meet snowball the pig. Charlie's a pig. I've died and gone to heaven. Snowball, tell us about yourself. Oh, I'm good-hearted and I believe that all animals should be treated fairly and share their property equally. Thanks, snowball. Time to get back to the farm. Bye, snowball. Bye. But all is not well on the farm, because here comes-- Napoleon, the conqueror pig. I am a troublemaker. I tell some of the animals they're better than others. That's right, I'm a bad pig. Oh oh oh. That is my new screen saver. But thankfully, Muriel the goat calms things down with some of her words of wisdom. Come on, Muriel. I'm gonna see what's keeping her. What's the hold up? Charlie's kinda gassy. Might be those fish sticks we fed her in the cafeteria. They're talking back to me too. Okay, I'd better wrap things up. Come here. Come here. Yes yes yes. All right. Okay. And here is Muriel the fast-talking goat. Hey, kids. Want to know what I have to say? Read the book. So in the end the animals become just as evil as the humans they overthrew. And now you can't tell the animals from the humans. Thank you, everyone. Bravo, Miss Duncan. You made the book come alive, and in the most adorable way. I'm-- I'm-- I'm so sorry. Ivy, help. Oh, here come the sticks. Well, now it smells like an animal farm. Hey, mom. Hey, dad. Hey, how was story time at the library? It was okay. We read Everybody Poops. The title kind of gives away the ending. Did Charlie have fun? I don't know. We didn't sit together. Anyway, I'm gonna be taking off again soon. Going out with the moms again? No no, I'm done with that. I'm glad you're over it. Me too. What was I thinking? What do I have in common with a bunch of women in their 30s? Mom, dad, this is Marge, the story lady from the library. We're going to tea. These are your grades on yesterday's final presentations. Mr. gerkin, fit yourself with a hairnet. Miss Wentz. Oh my gosh. Miss Duncan, your grade and my dry-cleaning bill. Oh my gosh. Two Bs in a row? What if my mom starts to expect this? I'd better turn this into a d. Mr. Dingwall. Yes? I just wanted to say thank you for my A. You earned it, for creativity, imagination and style. Nicely done. Thank you. Now pretend that bell was a fire alarm and the flames are upon us. Just one more thing. You know, I had this crazy idea that the reason you were being so tough on me was because you didn't like me. It's crazy, right? Because obviously you like me, right? Teddy, not everyone in your life is going to like you, and the reason may have nothing to do with you. Doesn't mean you've failed. Just means you're human. Okay? Okay. But, you know, you never actually said if you like me-- okay. Okay, if you like me, don't say a word. Goodbye. Ugh! Well, Charlie, no more fish sticks for you. But thanks for all your help with Mr. Dingwall. Because of you I got an a. Whoo! And I learned that not everyone is going to like me, and I'm okay with that. I'm working on being okay with that. But just in case Wish me good luck, Charlie. Go go go. Come on, come on. Have you seen the team? They went that away. Come on, come on. Have you seen the--? Duncans. Still can't find them? No. And I've searched the entire city. How was the so insanage done with Gabe You know, when I was coaching we didn't have this problem.
Uh-oh, Charlie, look at your tummy. I think somebody's had enough pancakes. No no. Oh my goodness, Somebody loves her blankie. Whoo! All right, dad, now pull out your blankie. Sure thing, son, Right after I drop you off at a military school. Oh, hey, look what's gonna happen on Saturday. Oh, yeah, the truck from the thrift store is coming. And it's your wedding anniversary. Right. What time is the truck coming? So how are you guys gonna celebrate this year? There's no better way to celebrate than the tax deduction. We're gonna get from donating old clothes. Bob, remember the deduction from our 10th anniversary? Ooh! Guys, guys, guys, you know what? I think we should do something for mom and dad on their anniversary. Don't we do enough for them on mother's and father's day? You never do anything for them. Excuse me, I was born, which made them a mother and a father. My work is done. Well, I think. We should surprise them with a romantic dinner. You're gonna make a dinner? I think we should surprise them. And order a romantic dinner. Then we can serve it to them like waiters. Why do girl ideas always take so much work? I get it. If we do something nice for them, They have to do something nice for us. Like give us presents. Yes. Why can't we just do it because we love them? Because then we don't get stuff. Duh. Today's all burnt toast{\i0} Running late, and dad jokes{\i0} Has anybody seen my left shoe{\i0} I close my eyes, take a bite{\i0} Grab a ride, laugh out loud{\i0} There it is up on the roof{\i0} I've been there, I've survived{\i0} So just take my advice{\i0} Hang in there, baby{\i0}, Things are crazy{\i0} But I know your future is bright{\i0} Hang in there, Baby{\i0} There is no maybe{\i0} Eveything turns out all right{\i0} Sure life is up and down{\i0} But trust me, it comes back all around{\i0} You're gonna love who you turn out to be{\i0} Hang in there, Baby{\i0} Hey! Shouldn't someone go tell Charlie to shut up? You know what? You give it a shot. We've been trying all night long. And by We He means me. Come on, I got up that one time. And when you flushed, you woke her up. But why is she so fussy? We can't find her blankie. And we've looked everywhere. Oh, that's ridiculous. She shouldn't need something to help her sleep. What about your stuffed monkey? Coco's different. Guys, what a horrible way to spend your anniversary. We should really get out of the house. Ow. What are you doing? Oh. Mom and dad, on your anniversary I'm taking you to lunch and a movie, My treat. Oh, dad, bring your wallet. You don't know what My treat Means, do you? Okay, we'd love to go to a movie, kids, But not when Charlie's so upset. I'll find Charlie's blankie and take care of her. Now you two go out and enjoy some alone time. On your anniversary. With Gabe. And I know the perfect movie to see Star Exploders II: Ticking Asteroids in 3D. Hey, you know what? The critics hated that. That means it's gotta be good. Oh, yeah. Or we could see The Willow Weeps Tomorrow. What's that about? It's a haunting tale of a young girl. Who lives on a farm, plants a willow tree. And grows up with dreams of becoming a ballerina. And then on the day of the big audition. She twists her ankle, goes back to the farm, Gets married and has a baby. And do you know what she names it? Willow. I feel like we just saw it. And hated it. Oh, come on, guys. It's my anniversary too. No no no, you're absolutely right. Look, we don't have to figure this out now. We'll decide when we get to the theater. Okay. Okay. Star Exploders! Charlie, I'm looking for your blankie. Please stop crying. Oh, look, it's your favorite show The circles. They're the colorful singing shapes. That teach you about shapes. I am a red circle, yes, I am I am big and round and red. Hey! Man, this is annoying. Oh, what's this I found? Is this your blankie? I'll take that as a no. Let's take you on a walk. That'll make you feel better. Yay! Excuse me. Excuse me. Great, I think I'm the only woman in here. Hey, what about? Nope. I'm kind of getting hungry. Yeah, you know what? Let's eat. Pass this to your dad. Isn't this great Not having to buy that movie theater food? We're saving so much money. I guess I had a different picture in my mind. When Gabe said Lunch and a movie. I think he said Lunch in a movie. Mom, do you have my milkshake? Oh. You know what? I think it's easier. If you just stick the straw in. Hey, the movie's starting. Really? Excuse me, could you take off your tentacles? Got the cake. Whoa. What's all this about? Oh, it's the theme for tonight's dinner. I turned the living room into a moroccan palace. So we'll be serving moroccan food? Won't that make dad gassy? Name a country that won't make dad gassy. Good point. Are you still looking for Charlie's blankie? I can't find it anywhere. I thought I put it in that pile of dirty clothes. We have a dirty clothes pile? Yeah, it's where your clothes magically go. After you throw them on the floor. I hope you didn't put it on the donation pile. For the thrift store, cause that is long gone. We gave her blankie away? You gave her blankie away. We have to get it back. You have to get it back. Stop saying that. You stop saying that. You know, I'm usually the one who messes things up. But this time everything on my side of the operation. Is going just fine. See? Bon voyage, Esther & Marty? Oops. You brought home the wrong cake. Can't we just tell mom and dad. That Bon voyage Is french for Happy anniversary? What about Esther & Marty? Who cares about them? They're on a ship. Okay, we still have time before mom and dad get home. We can fix this. How? You drop me off at the thrift store. I'll grab the blankie while you go switch cakes. Let's do it. Let's do it with Charlie. Oh! Yeah! That was awesome. And derivative. They did it in Solar Troopers: Star Quest IV. How many stars have to explode before this thing is over? 10, 365, Or so they said in the chat room. Hey, mom, could you jiggle your purse? My shake's clogging. Honey, put your phone away. It's distracting. My phone is distracting from the 3d destruction of the milky way? Do you mind? You were talking too. About the movie, which is totally allowed. Oh, yeah? Honey, honey, where are you going? Out. Excuse me, could you move your flipper? I should go talk to her. Mr. President, Only you can give the order to explode the supernova. May the galaxy forgive me. Whoo! Excuse me, excuse me. Hi, I donated something and I have to get it back. Oh, dear. Someone doesn't know what the word Donation Means. See, darling, when you donate something, you do not get it back. You don't understand how important this is. I accidentally gave away my baby sister's blankie. Your baby sister's blankie?! I still don't care. Did someone wake up on the wrong side of the bed? I sleep on the futon. Mama gets the bed. Can you help me? I'm afraid it's out of my hands. Everything that was donated this week is already on that truck. Leslie's dog-washing service. If your pooch is dirty, I'll make him purty. Side business. I'm also a life coach. Yeah, uh-huh. Oh, I think I see it. No, ma'am, we don't wash cats. Cats wash themselves. Uh-oh. Wait, no. Hold it, no. Boop boop boop! This is zaalouk, couscous, Tajine, pastilla and harira. Any questions? Actually, I do have a question. Is your name really Aziz? It is on saturdays between 5:00 and 9:00. Tuesdays and thursdays I'm Raoul from El Gaucho. Oh, cool. I'm also in the food delivery business. I work for Kwikki Chikki. You mean the guys who wear the rooster hat. With the cartoon beak? Where's your pride, man? Gotta answer the phone. Hello. PJ Teddy, what happened to you? I went to the thrift store and you weren't there. I'm locked in the back of a truck. Ooh, this is cute. Someone threw this out? What? Teddy, I can't hear you. Try going outside to get better reception. If I could go outside, I wouldn't have to call you. Okay, I have an idea why don't I go outside? Can I hear you now? I'm locked in the back of a truck. Locked in the back of a truck? Teddy, how could you be so stupid? Um, forget that question. I gotta go. Wait, no. Wait, no. Um, yeah. Charlie, hi. Can you open the door for me? Charlie, come here. Charlie, where are you going? Charlie, Charlie. Charlie, can you come here? Thattagirl. A little closer. A little closer. Charlie, no. No, not the food. Charlie, please. Please come here. Charlie, Charlie, hi, hi. Come here. Come here. Yes, thattagirl. Thattagirl. A little closer. A little closer. Ugh. You can do that, but you can't open the door? Hey, honey, you're missing the whole movie. Yeah, that's kind of the idea. What are you doing out here? The guy with the tentacles cut the cheese. Yeah, it was the guy with the tentacles. Honey, what's wrong? I don't know. I guess the truth is it would be nice to do more on our anniversary. We used to do special things. Now we're eating onion rings out of my purse. There were onion rings? But I thought we agreed we weren't gonna do anything special. Yeah, I know. I know we did. So now you want to do special things? Well, it's better than doing unspecial things, Like sitting in a theater full of 40-year-old nerds. Hey, I'm only 36. Okay, you know what? You guys go back and enjoy your movie. And I'm gonna go see The Willow Weeps Tomorrow. No, honey, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Are you gonna want the onion rings or? Here you go. Happy anniversary. I don't think I handled that very well. Ya think? Oh, man. I should have planned something. Well, maybe you did. What do you mean? Well, Teddy, p. J. And I are surprising you guys. With an anniversary dinner. It was all my idea, not Teddy's. But I can let you take the credit. Are you serious? You'd do that for me? Sure. Just remember me on Gabe's day. What's Gabe's day? Surprise me. Agh! An arm! My goodness, people will donate anything. A little help here. What are you doing in the back of my truck? Looking for my sister's blankie. And it's not in here, Although I did find this really cute top, see? You know what would look good with that? Get out of my truck! But I don't even know where I am. You're in the driveway of my house. Mama always likes first dibs on my pile. Wait, and you still have to sleep on the futon? That just doesn't seem right. Would you mind telling that to my mama? Charlie, please open the door. Open window. Ha ha! Coming, Charlie. This is so sad. I know. First she loses her man, And now her sense of smell. Her problem is she loves too much. I smell Oscar. But she won't. What are you doing here? I was worried about you. And our movie ended. Ow! Look, honey, I wasn't gonna tell you this, But I've got an anniversary surprise waiting for you at home. Really? What is it? If I told you, it wouldn't be much of a surprise now, would it? Oh. I love you. Thanks for staying and watching the rest of the movie with me. Oh. Okay. Why do I have to stay? Because if you don't, Gabe's day is canceled. What are you doing here? I have a heart as well as a brain. I'm not a robot. I wish I was. Hey, dad, do you want to switch seats? So then I left Broadway. I've never looked back. I can't believe I didn't find Charlie's blankie. I could have sworn I looked at every single thing in that truck. Were you even listening to my life's story? Does the name Patti lupone mean nothing to you? I'm sorry, I just What are you sitting on? Just a little blanket. No, that's Charlie's blankie. Give me that! Oh, there. Why were you sitting on it? How shall I put this? I have a medical condition known as posterial hydrosis. What's that? Butt sweats. Eww. Well, at least I got it back. Stop the truck. Back it up. Boop boop boop! Okay, look, before we go in I just want to say something. Now I know I'm not always the most romantic guy, But I should be, because you deserve it. Happy anniversary! Surprise! Oh, Charlie. What happened? Ask dad. He planned the whole thing. For your anniversary we'd like to serve you a traditional moroccan feast. But since that ended up on the floor, we bring you Peanut butter toast. This is so sweet of you kids. You know, I think this turned out to be a pretty great anniversary after all. I don't even mind that I'm sitting in couscous. And now it's time for the entertainment. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present to you The dancing Duncans! Isn't it amazing how a little piece of cloth can make someone so happy, Even when it's covered in tire tracks and butt sweat? I'm gonna wash it after you fall asleep. But it's so funny, because we love our blankies so much, And then one day we forget all about them. And if you're like me, you'll grow out of yours by the time you're five. Good night. But if you're like Gabe, You might bring it on your honeymoon. Good luck, Charlie. Hey, you know what? I'm kind of hungry. Pass this your dad. Anything else? I had chicken yesterday. Got anything else? What, no fixings? Hold on. Hey, honey, aren't you gonna have something? Oh, I almost forgot. Okay, Who ordered nachos? That would be me. Shh.

You know, Gabe, you're gonna need the girl vote to win, Which, lucky for you, I can deliver. - How would you do that?- We shoot a campaign video, Post it on the class website. And we'll put your baby sister in it. Girls go nuts over babies. I don't get it, but they do. Why do you want to help me? I thought we were enemies. Gabe, let's not put labels on our relationship. We both know it's complicated. No kidding. I had this dream last week where you Yeah, it's complicated. Okay, probably something like this. Got it. Cool. Now you do it. Okay. So? Really good, But you're not doing what I showed you. I know. I feel like it needs something more, right? Or less.

I think it's a great idea. Some of the teachers think we should have more homework. Thoughts? That's a terrible idea. The amount of homework we do now is good. And finally, new playground rules pro or con? I don't like them at all. There's safety and there's fun. You can't have them both. Loving it.Now say, I'm Gabe Duncan and I approve this message. I'm Gabe Duncan and I approve this message. Awesome. We're done. You want to play a video game? Until the election I think it's best we keep this professional. Or you could be the dummy. Or you could be the dummy. Or you could be the dummy. We could do this all day. We have been doing this all day. Well, I can't be the dummy 'cause I'm not comfortable with you putting your hands up my shirt. You didn't feel that way last week. When you had that itch you couldn't reach. All right, then what if we're both dummies? Fine, we're both dummies. I don't know what's been going on in here, But you two just made a breakthrough. Hey, ivy, you got a minute? You found out Teddy can't dance, right? She's awful. I don't want to embarrass myself. In front of the whole school.What am I gonna do? You gotta tell it to her straight. Just rip the bandage off and say, girl, you stink. You know, that kind of honesty. Might be better coming from the best friend. You're funny. Fine. I'll do it. I'll just be honest with her. I sprained my ankle. Oh, no. What happened? I was trying to practice some of your dance moves. And then I slipped. Mm, too much hacking on the sacky? Exactly. And right before the talent show. Talk about bad timing. You poor thing, come in. Have a seat. I'm gonna put your foot up. Can I get you anything? Are you hungry? A little. You know what you need? Some homemade chicken soup. Mm, chicken soup. For the chicken. Jo just put the campaign video on the website. You want to watch it? Sure, honey. How well do you really know Gabe Duncan? I will fight you! He hates babies. Gabe, how would you feel if there was no more recess? I think it's a great idea. Really? And what's your opinion about less homework? That's a terrible idea. The amount of homework we do now is good. And finally, how do you feel about girls? I don't like them at all. Gabe Duncan No recess, more homework, hates girls, Especially baby girls. m jo keener and I want to be your president.

Oh, spence, not everybody gets the exploding jazz hands. The first time out. It's a process. The problem wasn't me. Oh. It's no big deal. Lots of people can't dance. And you're one of them. For your information, I'm a great dancer. Teddy, I'm just being honest. Oh, like you were about your ankle? No, you know what? I'm gonna find myself a new partner - Someone who appreciates my talent. Teddy, come on. I even knitted you special socks to keep your toes warm, 'cause that's another thing I'm good at knitting. My class is this way.

And be honest. I love it. Duh. Really? Cause spencer said I was a bad dancer. Let's not talk about spencer. He's in the past. It's emmett time. So which of my moves should we start with? Actually I'm thinking that we should save your moves till the end. You don't start a fine meal off with dessert, right? Right. So I'll just start dancing,do whatever it is I do The meat and potatoes And then you can bring it home with the Crimble leg. The Crimble leg. A little less Crimble leg The Crimble leg. A little less.

We have to do something about this jo person. You don't have to do anything. No, I do, I do, Because nobody attack my babies. Now bob, I want you to go over to jo's house. And punch her dad in the face. If he's anything like jono, thanks. Once again I am the one who has to do the butt-kicking around here. Honey, would you relax? Nobody needs to kick anything. That's right. I've got a plan and I need your help. There, you see? He's got a plan. Yes. Would you stop stretching? Let's go. I'm not stretching. I'm stuck.

And now please welcome the dance stylings of Locomotion! Emmett! Are you okay? Get away from me. Thank you, locomotion And friends. And now for our next act. Did anyone survive that? I'm still here. Please give it up for master ventriloquist. P. J. Duncan!. Hi, everybody. I'm p. J. This is Charlie. Say hello, Charlie. I was hoping to get by on cuteness. How are we doing so far? And as your president I promise to represent you. I also promise to fight. For more recess and less homework. And of course, I don't hate girls. Like some candidates. Named Gabe Duncan. Thank you. Before I begin, I would like to say something about this campaign. Now a lot of things have been said about me. And even though they aren't true, I'm okay with that. But when somebody starts attacking my family That's where I draw the line. Now I could stand here. And tell you who I really am, But I'd rather show you. I love all my kids equally, But if I had to pick a favorite, It would be Gabe. I changed the oil in your truck, dad. Without being askedclassic Gabe. He's just so loving and so caring, Especially with his baby sister Charlie. In fact, Gabe was the most excited about Charlie's arrival. And he made it himself. Gabe's the kind of guy you want to have a root beer with. We'll stay up all night if we have to, But I'm gonna make sure you pass that test. Don't you have to rescue stray animals. And find them good homes? Did that before school. Classic Gabe. Gabe's not only sweet and kind, He also has an amazing fashion sense. This onefun and playful. This one is off the hook! And they all lived happily ever after. Mwah. Gabe Duncan Family first. Gabe, Gabe, Gabe, Gabe! - Hey. - Hey. I just wanted to say I know what you're gonna say. You saw the talent show and now you want to say I told you so, Because you were right. I can't dance. Actually I was going to apologize. For lying about my ankle. Oh, okay. Go ahead then. I'm sorry for lying about my ankle. I'm sorry I lied about those socks. What? I didn't actually knit them myself. I can't knit. Or dance. Hey, if I wanted a dancing knitter, I'd date my aunt betty. So we're good? We're great. Emmett Get away from me! Hey, Charlie. So yesterday was the school talent show. And I hold in my hand the winning check for $25. Which is made out to PJ Duncan. Yeah, the one that's based on your cuteness, Charlie. And mine. Anyway, I on the other hand owe the school. Some money for damages. And erwin said he'll shee me in court. So my advice is, If someone ever tells you you're bad at something you love, Don't give up. Just make sure. You don't do it in front of the whole school. And if I ever offer to teach you how to dance, Well, good luck, Charlie. Gabe, lunch. All clear. Gabe, really, is all this necessary? Yes, it is. I'm the president. Of room 12.

No. All right, look, it may not be as glamorous as nebraska, But you know what? Hawaii's a pretty cool state. Name one cool thing about it. Well, it's the only state made up entirely of islands. Okay. It has lots of unique flora and fauna. Dad, we can't just fill up our report with a bunch of facts. All right, you know what? Hawaii's got an active volcano. Hey, we could build a volcano. I like things that explode. I don't know. Sounds like a lot of work. Okay, well, I do have another idea. Volcano it is. P. J. , you know what I was just thinking about?. Remember when we used to have a mommy-and-p. J. Day?. We should do that again. We haven't done that since I was seven. How about tomorrow? We'll do whatever you want. You know what'd be fun?

Tomorrow after school, We are having a p. J. -And-mommy day. And you are gonna love it. Mom, you can make me go, but you can't make me love it. Okay, I'll love it. I thought mommy-and-teddy day would be fun, But apparently not. Honey, it's actually p. J. -And-dentist day. Oh, sneaky. The only way for me to get him there is for me to trick him. So what's this take gabe to laser tag? Haircut. What's this? I was cleaning out my desk drawer, Came across this gift certificate to a day spa. I think I forgot to give it to you, like, on valentine's day. Or something. I don't know. Dad, was there anything for me in the magic drawer? Uh, yes A flyer to your fourth-grade production of the sound of music. I look forward to attending. Bob honey, this gift certificate expires tomorrow. - Well, let's go tomorrow. I can't. I have to take p. J. To the dentist. Mom, go. I'll get p. J. To the dentist. How you gonna do that? I'll figure something out. I don't know if you've noticed, but I'm smarter than him. What about charlie and gabe? Yeah, they're smarter than him too. Volcano's looking great, dad. Do you think it's big enough? Good point. Little bigger, dad. This is just the frame. It's gonna be a whole lot bigger. After it's been papier-mached. You don't have to tell us. Just do it. Gabe, this is my house. I don't take orders from you or anybody else. Bob, time to go to the spa. Coming, honey. Okay, kids, let's listen up. Now the volcano is going to erupt when you press this button. If you wanted it to erupt again, You'd have to take the whole thing apart. Therefore and I cannot stress this strongly enough Do not press the button. What'd he just say? Something about a button. This is bob. Yeah. No, I got it. I got it. Okay. Yeah, we'll see you there in about 20 minutes. Sorry, honey, it's an extermination call. We gotta make one little stop before we get to the spa. Really? Honey, it's a 313 code yellow. What's that? Possum. Wouldn't it be faster to just say possum? Well, sure, you want to take all the magic out of it. What's this stuff called again? Newspaper. It's how people in the olden days got their news. Uh, gabe, jo, listen up. So p. J. And I have to leave, but I'll be back in like 15 minutes. That means you're gonna be alone with charlie. Now she's taking a nap upstairs. She probably won't bother you. But if you have any problems with charlie, just give me a call on my cell. What'd she say? Something about charlie. Ow, p. J. !. Oh! Ow, p. J. !. What? What's wrong? I think I broke my tooth. Let me see. Ew! It's a bloody mess in there. And there's seeds. Yeah, well, can you take me to the dentist? Ha, so awesome. What? That I broke my tooth? No, that I got out of mommy-and-p. J. Day. This is so cool. I've never seen you in action doing your bug-catching thang. Okay, look, the thang that we're catching. Is not a bug, it's a possum. Mm-hmm. Which rhymes with awesome. Bam! Ow! Will you cut that out? I'm on duty. Thank you. Okay. All right, here we go. I think we've got a problem. Oh well, guess I'll have to see you do your thang some other time. Come on. Let's go get massages. Um, or Pop! Nah nah nah nah nah! Oh no. Please? I would do this for you. Well, this is officially our second-worst date ever. What was the worst? Hot tubbing with your grandparents. No, you're right. That was a bad idea. Ow ow. Oh, excuse me, excuse me. Uh, my sister needs to see the dentist. Her mouth is all bloody. It's really bad. There's seeds. Last name? Duncan. Oh okay. Yeah, we have you right here. P. J. Duncan, 3:00. What? But that-that can't be right. No, that is right. Hello, P. J. Emmett? What are you doing here? I asked him to come. Why aren't you holding your mouth anymore? Because I'm not seeing the dentist today. You are. P. J. , it's time. No! Ow! I can't do this. No! Yes, you can. Okay? You have a problem, But we're gonna help you through it. We all want what's best for you, man. Look, what if I promise to start flossing? Okay, we've heard those promises before. Come on, man, be strong. You're right. It's just a little tooth. It's just a little tooth. Thattaboy. No no no! Get him, get him! P. J. , let go! Let go, let go. Our first hug. Oh, not now! Don't make me brush you! Oh no. Where are my Glasses? Oh! Now my tooth is really broken. Oh! P. J. , let's go. I said, let's get a fish tank. He said, no, the big toothbrush will be fun. Charlie, go to sleep, please. Just stop. Gabe, unless that kid can paint, get her out of here. Teddy, when are you getting home? I don't care about your stupid tooth. You can't leave me alone with charlie. Wait, teddy! Oh. You're not alone, Gabe. I'm not gonna help you, but you're not alone. What's that smell? It's coming from the business end of that kid. You gotta change it. I don't know how to change a diaper. It's just like taking apart a burrito. And then putting it back together. I think I've eaten my last burrito. You look adorable. Shut up. Okay, honey, look, the possum's in the trap. All you gotta do you just gotta tie the rope to it. And I'll pull it right out. OH I love you. Whatever. Oh my gosh. What do you see, honey? Dirt, cobwebs, bugs. I don't know how you do this all day, Bob. That's cause I know I'm coming home to you, sweetie. Oh, shut up. Okay, I see the trap. Bob, I'm not so sure, this is a possum. What do you mean? Well, are possums black with a white stripe? What? No, get out. That's not a possum. That's a. Skunk. Ah, charlie, stay still. Stupid diapers. Can you please keep it down back there? I'm trying to work here. Okay. You know, this would be a lot easier if you helped me. Yes, it probably would, but we had an agreement. I'll handle my thing that explodes and you'll handle yours. Well, we've got a problem. I'm all out of clean diapers. Now what am I gonna do? Okay, Charlie, all better now. Is that a shirt And duct tape? Yes. Oh. See, I call it the shirt diaper. The good thing is that she's protected. And it's not my shirt. Oh, now what? Why can't she just sit still? I bet some more duct tape would make her sit still. Hey, I'm gonna need to practice for my debate later. Could you give me a topic? Okay. How about, why won't you go out with me? No, I need a topic I can argue from both sides. Okay, here we go. Is this real life? The doctor gave him some anesthesia. Teddy, come on back. Teddy? I have a sister named teddy. Okay, so you didn't like carrots. How about some yummy peaches? There you go. Oh! That's it. You're in trouble now. Jo, get in here! What do you want now? She won't eat. Not my problem. Hey! Don't walk away when I'm talking to you. I have work to do. I don't care. I'm having a really bad day. And all I'm asking for is a little respect. Oh, so what I do isn't important? Stop putting words into my mouth. You know what? That's it. I'm outta here. You can't leave. Oh yeah? Watch me. Jo, wait, don't go. It's the first time I've been left alone with Charlie. I'm blowing it. I can't do this by myself. All right, I'll help you with the baby. But just so you know, every doll I've ever had ended up without its head. Would you look at that? You're really good with babies. Yeah, I guess I am. If you ever tell anyone, I'll hurt you. We're back. Oh, here we go, charlie. Here you go. Am I in hawaii With grandma? I told you, these are my grandma's glasses. Just because I'm wearing them doesn't make me grandma. You're cranky, old lady. Hey, Emmett, where's teddy? Dropped her off at her debate. Okay, buddy, how about we have a seat? This thing followed me all the way home. Hey kids. Hey dad. Why is charlie wearing a shirt diaper? Uh, long story. Where's mom? Longer story. Hi, everybody. Mommy got stung. It was all daddy's fault. Uh, honey, can you get that thing behind you? Right back there. Love you. Shut up. Honey, just scrub yourself real good with that tomato juice for about two hours. It'll get the smell right out I hope. Kids, don't ever go to the spa with daddy. Hey hey hey. Hey, baby girl. I tell you what: Let's get you a real diaper, okay? Oh, that's my ride. I'm starving. Are you hungry? I can't believe I'm gonna say this, But I had fun. Me too. And we finished a pretty awesome project too. I know. Can't wait to see that volcano erupt. I know. Okay. No! No! Wait, don't don't don't! Volcano made a boom boom. And that is why. For the safety of our students. And the peace of mind of our parents, I would argue that cell phone use in school. Should not only be allowed, It should be encouraged. Thank you. Miss duncan, your rebuttal? 咳 Cellular phone usage. Is a serious problem. That presents many challenges for the consumer. What? I said, Cellular phone usage is a serious issue I concede. Hey, charlie, gabe here. And I'm doing the video diary tonight. Because teddy's having some troubles with her words. Nothing serious. Yeah. Anyway, today was the first day I took care of you. It went totally perfect. What? Okay, there were a few problems. But, I mean, you're fine. So they're probably going to make me take care of you again. Yeah. Good luck, charlie. I've got to say, gabe, I wasn't sure about these things, But they are really comfortable. Yeah. I can't believe how much time I'm going to save by not having to go to the bathroom. Dude, ha!

Who's your buddy? Ow! She bit me. Charlie. Man, this really hurts. I'm so sorry. Maybe she thought you were yummy. Maybe you guys should feed her. We do feed her. I mean, I don't, But I assume somebody does. I'd better go get this looked at. I'm so sorry. Oh, maybe we could not study some other time. I'll call you. Okay. Charlie, you chased my boyfriend away. Are you happy now? What are you doing? Looking for loose change. Gotta scrounge up 300 bucks somehow. How much do you have so far? A Penny. A checker. Possibly a grape? No. What if I said I could take care of your little problem? You can get this taste out of my mouth? No, I'm talking about the 300 bucks. How do you have $300? Simple every day I have mom make me lunch. And ask dad for lunch money. It adds up quick. So you'll give me the money? I will loan you the money. Oh, you know I'm good for it. Hey, you know where I live, right? Yeah, gonna need you to sign this. What is it? Just a simple contract. That I downloaded from the Internet. Feel free to look it over. Whoa, a lot of words here. It's pretty standard. It just says you'll pay me back some money. And some, you know, other stuff. Good enough for me. Okay. You signed where it says Date. And thinking that might happen, Here's another copy. And then Charlie bit him. Why would she do that? Was he dressed like a giant cookie? Yes, Ivy. Spencer was dressed like a giant cookie. I'm serious. Charlie's never done this before, like, with anyone. Well, maybe Charlie senses there's something wrong with Spencer. You know what they say Dogs and kids are the best judges of character. Yeah, what could possibly be wrong with Spencer? He's good looking. He's smart. He's Captain of the football team. And he likes me. But how much do you really know about him? Spencer could be hiding something. Everybody has a secret. Oh yeah? What's your secret? I love country music. There, I said it. You do not. Oh? Check this out. Oh yeah. Come on, do it with me. You know you want to. Oh, what the heck. To the left. To the back. Kick it. What do you think, mom? Wow, it's It's a car. Where did you get it? It used to belong to my friend's grandma. Oh, did she stop driving? No, breathing. She was on her way to a buffet. And took a detour to heaven. Oh no. Luckily she was at a stop sign, So there was no body damage to the car, I mean. Okay, so she passed away in here? Right where you're sitting. And I'm out. Ahh. Ah, the new car smell. Or is it death? Take me to the arcade. Step on it. Excuse me? Arcade place for fun and games. Step on it to drive quickly. I'm not taking you anywhere. I guess somebody didn't read his contract, Which clearly States. That you have to give me a ride. Whenever and wherever I want. You tricked me. Here, I brought you a cute little cap to wear. While you're driving me around. Hey, Spencer. What's up? I just wanted to see if we were still on for tonight. My mom's working, so it's just gonna be you and me. That's great. And of course Charlie. Oh, wait a minute. Tonight? I totally forgot. I have a thing. A thing? What kind of thing? It's a family thing. I can't get out of it. Oh really? Are you sure? Honey, he's not coming.

What's going on? Teddy, I don't think this is working out. What's not working out? Us. Wait a minute. Are you breaking up with me? Yes. Why? Because of her. Spencer, wait! Spencer! Spencer! It was just a dream. Oh, Teddy honey, I almost forgot. I'm gonna need you to watch Charlie after school. I have a dentist's appointment. No, I can't watch Charlie. I have plans. I was gonna go surprise Spencer at work. Teddy, I've had a temporary crown. Since I was pregnant. With you. Mom, mom, mom, Charlie's been driving Spencer and I apart. And if I don't go see him today, Our entire relationship might be at stake. Whoa. Okay, calm down here. I was a teenager once. I know what you're going through.

Bob and Amy, you're on the couch. Teddy enters from over there. Now remember, guys, This is just a rehearsal so use your scripts. And action. Teddy, can you come here a minute? Teddy crosses to the couch, nervous. 'Am I in trouble' question mark. No no no, kimmy, just the lines, honey. Not the other stuff, okay? And action. Teddy, we need to talk to you. Am I in trouble? Well, I'll just say it. - Your mother's gonna have a baby.   - Okay, can we stop? Can we stop? I'm sorry. These words they just don't fit into my mouth comfortably. But it's what happened. It's exactly what you said. The day you were supposed to be wearing scrubs. Okay, valid point, but do we want to make it real. Or do we want to make it good? I want to make it before my battery dies. Yeah. Well, that new bike sure is a beauty. Sure is, dad. - All right. Have fun. - Okay. - Gabe, before you go - Yeah? - One quick question. - Mm-hmm. You know that garage door remote that charlie had? - Mm-hmm. - How do you think she got that down from the cupboard? - Maybe you should ask charlie.  - Yeah, well, You know I can't do that. Oh, because she can't talk yet. - Yeah. - Yeah, that is a bummer. Yeah, it sure is. All right. You know what? I'll see you later. Okay. You know what? Just one more thing. Mm-hmm. You know, I don't even think. That remote works from the kitchen where charlie was. Dad, what are you trying to say? Are you accusing me of something? No, I just wanna know when you're gonna be back. Oh, half an hour. Can I go now? Of course you can, gabe. You've always been free to go. Okay. Okay okay, there she is. Now I'm going to prove to you that she likes me. - And not you. - Okay. Okay. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. So far it's a tie. Okay, I know we both have a lot to offer, But you're gonna have to choose between us. Oh, I choose P. J. Okay, let's try that again. And remember it's a multiple-choice question. My choice is still P. J. I'm sorry, I can't go out with you. I wouldn't do that to emmett. Pals before gals. - Thanks, man. - You'd do the same for me, right? Yeah, let's go with that. Wait a minute. I know what's going on here. - You think I'm nina.  - You're not? No! I'm tina. That's nina. Twins! Wait. What are we doing? And then I could say, Teddy girl, mama's having a baby child! Right? Right? Isn't that better? Doesn't it make more sense. That Amy would tell Teddy about the baby? Mama's having a baby child? Well, teddy, I'm just trying to find. The emotional truth to the piece. No thank you. Okay, fine. You want me to be a robot, I'll be a robot. I'll be a robot. Am I in trouble? No. No no no no no. Nobody's a robot. We're doing the script as written. Okay, places everyone. And action. Teddy, can you come here a minute? Am I in trouble? Teddy, we need to talk to you. Well, I'll just say it Your mother's gonna have a baby. A what? A baby. You're gonna have. A new little brother or sister. - Oh! - Now what are you doing? I just felt the baby kick. No. No no no. That's impossible. The baby doesn't have feet yet. Okay. You know what? I'm just trying. To figure out the mix of emotions that I was feeling that day. You know, the excitement, the confusion, The fear, the hormones. Yeah, do you know what I was feeling that day? It was why are you having another baby? You barely have time for the three kids you have now. Was that in the script? Because I'm lost. Teddy honey, What was that? I'm sorry, mom. I shouldn't have said that. Well, is that really how you felt? Were you really mad that we were having another baby? - Yeah, I kinda was.  - Why didn't you say something? Mom, what was I supposed to say? Charlie was on the way. You were all so excited. Excited? I didn't know how we were gonna make it all work. - I was terrified. - Really? Cause you didn't show it. That's because I'm a really great actress. Come here. Sit down. Do you still feel that way, Like we don't have enough time for you? Actually, today I thought maybe you had. A little bit too much time for me. No. Seriously, I don't know how you're doing it, But you guys are doing a great job. Well, that's because we're not doing it alone, And one of the big reasons it works is you. The boys help out too. But you're right, it's mostly me. Look, teddy. In the future, If ever you're feeling something, you've got to tell me, okay? Come here. Come here. I want us to always be honest with each other. Okay, I'll be honest with you. Say the lines as written or you're fired. Aww. What's the matter, gabe? - Um, dad   - Are you okay? You look shook up. - Wheelie's back.  - I know! Isn't it great? Yay. Um How did you find him? Oh, I came home from work, I saw that kid Jake on your bike, So I called the cops and they arrested him. They arrested Jake? But he's just a kid. Ooh, he won't be when he gets out. - What?   - What's wrong, son? Something bothering you? Um No. No? Well, something's bothering me, Because here's what I think really happened. First, you sold your bike to Jake And then you pocketed the money. Then you opened the garage door Using the keypad. Finally, you grabbed the remote From the kitchen cabinet And you planted it on charlie. Interesting theory, but it doesn't prove a thing. You're right. You're right. I didn't have any hard proof, But I kept thinking, thinking. And thinking. And then a bell went off. - Is gabe here?   - No. Tell him Jake wants his $10 back. This bike is a piece of junk. And that's when all the pieces fell into place. All right, you got me. Now what happens? Ask your mother. Back from the bike store. Charlie, your brother has something he would like to say to you. Go ahead, gabe. Charlie, I'm sorry I tried to frame you. Aw. Remember the first time I said that to you? Like it was yesterday. And now here is a little I'm-sorry present from your brother. Okay, bring it in. - Oh.  - Yay! Yeah, we exchanged gabe's new bike for this one. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Charlie, there you are on your very first bike. Yeah yeah. Teddy girl, Mama's baby child has a new tricycle! It's pink and red and it's got little stickers on it. Yup, and there's mom stealing your very first spotlight. Good luck, charlie. I feel so bad. I just can't tell them apart. - It is hard. - And I don't want to offend them. Well, you just have to find one little thing that's different. What do you think? I have no idea, and I'm married to one of them. Hey, uh, dads, Can I have five bucks? Huh. I love having two dads. Unbelievable! We'll never figure it out! Wait. Wait. Yup. That's my guy. Today's all burnt toast Running late, and dad jokes Has anybody seen my left shoe I close my eyes, take a bite Grab a ride, laugh out loud There it is up on the roof I've been there, I've survived So just take my advice Hang in there, baby,  Things are crazy But I know your future is bright Hang in there, baby There is no maybe Everything turns out all right Sure life is up and down But trust me, it comes back around You're gonna love who you turn out to be Hang in there, baby.

And I can assure you, we will not be making that announcement ever again. Yeah, this family is big enough. Hey, you completely clear on that, dad? Why you pointin' your finger at me? Having babies is a team effort. What do you mean? This should be good. Uh You know what? Getting back to that big announcement We're going on a family vacation! And it's our first one with Charlie. And Gabe. What are you talking about? You've been on lots of vacations. Okay, visiting grandma after she had the fat sucked out of her butt. Is not a vacation.

And it happens to be  Where your dad and I got married. It's very romantic. Honey, you just interrupted me. I was just trying to get to the point, Bob. You know your stories go on forever. And the romance continues. You know, the weekend we got married, We weren't even planning on doing it. Getting married. Then we met judge Lawson and he said we were perfect for each other. -So we did it. -Got married. Why do you keep saying that? Haven't you had the talk with him yet? I haven't had the talk with P. J. Yet. I'm good. Today's all burnt toast running late, and dad jokes Has anybody seen my left shoe I close my eyes, take a bite Grab a ride, laugh out loud There it is up on the roof I've been there, I've survived So just take my advice Hang in there, baby, Things are crazy But I know your future is bright Hang in there, Baby There is no maybe Eveything turns out all right Sure life is up and down But trust me, it comes back all around You're gonna love who you turn out to be Hang in there, Baby Oh, isn't it beautiful? A lot of good memories here. More to come. It's gonna be like this the whole week, isn't it? All right, why don't you kids have a seat while we check in? Hey, P. J. , I have to go to the bathroom. -Can you come with me? -Aren't you a little old for that? I put my ski pants on backwards. First vacation's always the hardest. Whoa. I am getting a very powerful vibe from you. Oh sorry. I've been sitting in a hot minivan for four hours. Oh, sweetie, no. No no no. I mean I'm a psychic. -Really? You're a psychic? -Yeah. 'cause, no offense, but you kind of look like a normal person. Did you know I was gonna say that? Did you know I was gonna say that? It doesn't work that way. And yes, I did. Would you like a free reading? You tell me. I'll give you one anyway. Give me your hands. Oh, this trip is going. To be a very important one for you. I'm seeing you will have two left feet. And that's odd. Now I see there is a bear in your room. And now I see why you give free readings in the lobby. And finally, I see you will come face to face. With the love of your life. Oh whoa. Okay. No thanks. I I just got out of a relationship. With this guy named Spencer, So I'm not really looking to meet anybody. You think it's up to you. That's cute. Uh, excuse me. I have to take this. Take what? Hello? Oh, what a surprise. Not really. Come on, don't you want to go snowboarding? I'm doing it right now. Check this out. I just broke my neck. Sweet. So what are you gonna do all day? Room service! Does that answer your question? Your order, sir. French fries, potato chips and onion rings a la mode. Mr. Starkwell? Gabe. You two know each other? Mr. Starkwell was my third-grade teacher. Gabe is the reason I quit teaching. And he's the reason I went to summer school. You went to summer school because you've got a mouth on you Sir. Hey, remember me? Did I have you for third grade too? Yeah. We had two great years together. Well, looks like the foot's on the other shoe now, isn't it? Don't you mean the shoe is on the other foot? Your days of correcting me are over, Marvin. Oh, this is gonna be fun. What? Oh no. I brought two left boots by mistake. Wait two left feet. -Huh, that's weird. -What's weird? Well, I met this psychic in the lobby. And she made some crazy predictions. But one of them just kind of came true. I went to a psychic once. She was dead on about me, Said I was gonna be famous. But that hasn't come true. Yet. But mine was crazy. She said I'd come face to face with the love of my life. Well, it could happen, Teddy. Mount bliss is a magical place. Well, don't get too excited. She also said there would be a bear in my room. Oh! Run for your lives! Okay, that's just weird. Really? I thought it was kinda cute. All right, we'll go take it back. Wow. I could look at that view forever. Okay, that's enough. Hmm. Never seen this trail before. Cool. All right, yeah! Ahhh! Am I in heaven? -Hello. -Hi. Bye! Hey. Hey honey? Guess what? We're not actually married. Would you like to grab some lunch? What did you just say? You want to grab some lunch? No, before that. Oh, it turns out our wedding ceremony wasn't actually valid. You feel like mexican? What do you mean we're not actually married? Whoa whoa, I was asking around about judge Lawson. And the guy at the front desk tells me he was like some kind of con man. Apparently he did fake marriages all the time. But he said we were perfect for each other. Apparently it was just part of his scam. You know, there's this great fondue place I read about. Would you stop talking about food? This is serious. I mean, we're not really married? Well, according to the universe, of course we are, honey. According to the state of Colorado, not so much. -Oh hey, psychic lady! -Oh hi. So I've been looking around all day for the love of my life. And I haven't found him yet. So when's that gonna happen? Oh gosh, I don't know. Psychic prediction is not an exact science. Ha! It's not a science at all. Right. Can I at least have a little more info? Like is he hot or not? Not that it matters, but please say hot. All I can tell you is keep your eyes open. Okay. Well, they're open. And they're starting to see that this is a bunch of Hi. Hi. I'm Teddy. I'm Brandon. Wow. So I guess it's true. What's true? Well, you I mean, us. I mean, I didn't believe it, but then I had two left boots, Which aren't actually feet, but they're where feet go in. When you need something to walk in. So in a sense, they're feet. -What? -Okay okay, I probably sound a little bit crazy right now. But you would too if a psychic told you there was a bear in your room, Which there was sort of. Oh, and in my room, not in your room. I don't know anything about your room. I'm gonna go now. I'm not crazy. Seriously, I'm not crazy! For dinner I would like the lobster thermometer. It's lobster thermidor. What did I say about correcting me? That if I did it again, you were going to Well, I can't say I didn't warn you. Now chop chop and get me my lobster. I know this is none of my business, But you're running up quite a bill here. What do you mean? You don't know what room service is, do you? Yeah. I want things and you bring them to me. For an additional charge. Wait, it costs money? A lot of money. Shall we see how much money? Let's go to my favorite channel, The bill channel. Oh mama! $300?! I don't have that kind of money. Looks like you're in quite a pickle which, by the way, are $8. Mom and dad are gonna ground me forever. Perhaps we can make some kind of arrangement. What do you mean? I have to be a bellman? Bellboy. How's the cocoa? Are you warming up? Am I in heaven? Why does he keep saying that? I don't know. But it's so cute. So this is your cabin, huh? Yep. We don't get a lot of visitors. Especially ones with sparkling blue eyes. And beautiful blonde hair. This is a lucky day for everyone. Do you need to call your family and let them know you're okay? Nah, I'm good. So you girls live here alone? -No, our pa lives with us. -Oh. -But he's away on business. -Oh. Why did you go down the wrong side of the mountain? Because -Do you girls get T. V.

I'm gonna need more than one bath. Hey, mom, can I borrow your pink scarf? Sure, honey. Why are you all dolled up? Because I think I may have met the love of my life. Except I acted crazy and scared him away, So now I have to get super cute and hang out in the lobby. So he can fall in love with me. Mom, I've got to tell you, he is the perfect guy. Well, okay, tell me all about him. Okay. Well, he's really cute. His name is Brandon. And that's all I know. He does sound perfect. Hey, honey. Hey. Why aren't you dressed? I thought we were going skiing. No, change of plans. The front desk found a justice of the peace. Who's going to marry us this afternoon. What are you talking about? Um, honey. I want you to brace yourself. Okay? Your father and I aren't actually married. Oh my gosh. I forgot to floss. -So should we go get married? -Yeah. But can't it wait till we get home? Well, I just thought it would be really romantic and special. If we did it here You know, where we thought we did it 19 years ago. But I already bought the lift tickets. Oh, come on, honey! We're on vacation. Come on, I want to enjoy myself. Oh okay. So being married to me. Isn't something you'd enjoy? I'm not enjoying it right now. Fine, don't marry me then. Well, all right, fine. I won't. You won't last five minutes without me. Oh yeah? You just watch me. -Have you seen that -It's around your neck. Thank you. Starting right now, baby! Tell us more about your gold medal.

Enjoy your s'mores. Bye. Yeah, if mommy's gonna be single, You're gonna be single too. Hey, honey, still looking for the love of your life? Yeah, and I can't find him anywhere. Mom, what if I only had one chance and I blew it? I've been feeling exactly the same way. What? Because dad and I aren't actually married. And he didn't want to marry me again. I know I'm putting up a brave front, But I'm really hurting. Oh, maybe that's him! Hey, what's up? How's it going? Listen, if a big scary guy with a beard shows up, I'm not here. -Room service. -Yeah, come on in. Honey, food's here. -Wow. -What? Aren't you a little young to be working? I got myself into some trouble. Did you know that room service is extra? -Everyone knows that. -Not everyone, my friend. Great great. Do you mind setting it up over there? And if you could toss the salad, that would be great. My wife will be right out, okay? Uh, sure. Ech! -What did you do? -I tossed the salad. No, you've made a mess. Get out of here. I have to open the cider. Ow! My eye! I'm gonna go get you a washcloth, okay? If you need anything else, my name is Marvin. I assure you, sir, when we find this person, they'll be dealt with severely. Impersonating a bellman is a serious offense. Well, time to go skiing. -Whoa. -Hi. I it's so weird running into you. I haven't been looking for you. Okay, I see you have that scared look in your eye. And you're probably gonna bolt any second, So before you do that, Can we just start over? Sure. Hey, why don't I grab us some hot cocoa. And you find us somewhere to sit? P. S. I look really great next to fires. -Then I'll be right here. -Well, I'll be right back. -Whoa. -Hi. Hi. I'm Justin. Oh no, we're face to face. Yeah. Yeah, we are. But I already was face to face. I can't be face to face to face. Wait, what? Well, you were supposed to be him, but now I guess it could be you. You know what? I need to talk to my psychic. I'll be right back. Sorry. Teddy. Spencer. Next time on Good luck Charlie Where are we going to find $500? This is your last chance to sign up. For the ice-dancing contest. Grand prize $500. We'll be lucky to finish second. -There are only two teams. -So you're following me. Ah! Why do I have a new room? Because you and I are not legally married. And since it would apparently inconvenience you to marry me again, You'll be lodging elsewhere. She said I'd come face to face with the love of my life on this trip. And so far I've met Brandon, Justin and Spencer. There's something I really need to tell you face to face. No, don't say face to face.
Last time on Good luck Charlie We're going on a family vacation! You will come face to face with the love of your life. Hey, honey, guess what? We're not actually married. Would you like to grab some lunch? -I haven't found him yet. -All I can tell you is. -Keep your eyes open. -They're open. They're starting to see that this is a bunch of Whoa! I'm sorry. Teddy.

Wait, but -But I thought -Hi, honey. Oh, you made Brandon's favorite dinner. Wait a minute. Am I married to you. Or you or you? Yes. You couldn't decide which one of us was the love of your life. -So you married all of us. -But that's crazy. I'll tell you what's crazy It's 10 years later and I haven't grown at all. Ivy, I'm up here at the ski lodge and-and I met. This psychic who said I'd meet the love of my life. And so I met the guy but then I met another guy, And then you won't believe who showed up. And so that makes three guys and-and I need your help. Oh sorry. This is Teddy. When we get to the top, mind if I go first? You're kinda slow. Excuse me? I've seen you board. And I've also seen my grandma board. Kind of the same thing. -Better than you. -Oh yeah?! Care to put your money where your mouth is? Nope! Last time I did that, a quarter froze to my lip. I mean do you want to make a bet? 100 bucks says I beat you to the bottom. Oh, it is on. The only reason you won is because I hit a wicked patch of ice. Then I guess you have no problem making it double or nothing. Bring it. Hey, look what Charlie got. A present from that little toddler she has a crush on. -That's nice. -I guess some men know how to treat their women. -You seen my luggage? -Yes, I have. -Do you want to tell me where it is? -Sure. It's in your room Your new room. Why do I have a new room? Well, because you and I are not legally married. And since it would apparently inconvenience you. To marry me again, you'll be lodging elsewhere. -Oh come on! -Mm-hmm. As a single woman, I don't feel comfortable having a strange man in my room. -Amy Duncan, you're a piece of work. -Ah ah! Amy blankenhooper. You're going back to your maiden name? Yes, I am. Mm-hmm. To tell you the truth, I've always preferred blankenhooper. Yeah? What is it you like most about it? That people laugh so hard when they say it. Or just that they can't spell it? Get out, Bob. Hey, T! Oh, Ivy, I'm so glad you made it. You can lower your arms now. Don't you think I would if I could? Why do you have so many layers on? Ivy doesn't do cold. So what's the big emergency? Well, I met this psychic. Oh, so you did say psychic. I thought we were in a bad cell zone. Anyway, she said I'd come face to face with the love of my life on this trip, And so far I've met Brandon, Justin and -Spencer. -Spencer? The two-timing dog that cheated on you? -Yep, that's the one. -No! That's not the one. I mean, so who are these other boys? Oh, there there's one right now. That's Justin. Oh, he's cute! So what do you know about him? That he's cute. Well, I've only had one day. All I need is one minute. Yo, Justin! Teddy, hi. Hi, Justin. This is my best friend Ivy. How you doing, Justin. You a skier? -Yeah, I sure am. -Oh great. One other thing. -Does your family have money? -Ivy! Sorry. I actually didn't catch your answer. That's cause I didn't throw it yet. -P. J. ! -I need to borrow some money!. What did you say? I need to borrow some money! Stop that! -All right, me first. -Okay. I lost a bet and I need $200. I need $300. Did you know hotels charge for room service? Sure, everyone knows that. Did you know I'm a terrible snowboarder? Sure, everyone knows that. -We really should have talked earlier. -Yeah. Man, where are we gonna find $500? Attention, guests, this is your last chance. To sign up for the ice-dancing contest. Grand prize $500. That was convenient. Just one problem we don't know how to ice dance. Remember this is an amateur contest. You do not need to know how to ice dance. You're so funny. Hi, Bob. Didn't see you there. -Who's your friend? -Some guy I met. Ah. What's his name? Well, it's not Duncan, that's for sure. Yep, been there, done that. You know two can play at this game. Hiya, doll. I don't want to play this game. So you want to be a chef and a swimsuit model. That's a good combination. How do we know he's qualified? Can you cook us something? -With your shirt off? -Ivy! She's just kidding. Unless you want to. Hi, mommy. I'm in the lobby with some girls. No, they're not prettier than you. Okay, 0 for 2. So if it's not Brandon and it's not Justin, -Then that means -No, don't say Spencer! It cannot be Spencer. I don't want it to be Spencer! I was gonna say that means I came all the way up here for nothing, But yeah, let's keep it on you. So that's ice dancing, huh? It looked hard! Maybe we should go back to the lobby and see if there's another $500 contest. Come on, we can do this. We just gotta work out a routine. Um, okay, put your hands in the teapot position like they did in the video. Like this? -What's so funny? -Nothing. I'm ticklish. Well, don't be! -Let's try it again. -Okay. -Stop that! -I can't help it! Gabe, come on. If we're gonna do this thing, We have to pull together. We have to work harder. Than we've ever worked in our lives. We have to push ourselves to the absolute limit. And beyond. The contest is at 4:00. I won't kid you. It's going to be a rough hour and a half. What an awesome view. I totally agree. Oh no. Spencer, are you following me? Well, kinda, yeah. Um, there's something I really need to tell you face to face. No no, don't say face to face. -Why not? -Look, it's complicated. Can we just please sit here quietly until the ride's over? Just no more talking. The ski lift stopped. I hear talking. One and two and three and four. And arms arms, hands hands. And spin, two three four. And sell it! Not bad. Well yeah, but is not bad gonna win us $500? You're right. We need a special move. A move so good it'll blow the judges away. A move I call the cyclone of awesomeness. What's that? I don't know, I just like the name. Maybe we could try that move we saw on the video. You mean the one where the guy threw the girl in the air? Can we just say the big one and the little one? Fine. Now put your hand on top of mine like the girl did. Little one! All right. Now I'm gonna throw you and you spin. And while you're up there, try to do as much twirling as you can. Out, face, cheeks, Smile, back, spin. And throw! Whoa! I didn't see much twirling. It could be because you threw me into the wall. Try it again. Ready. Out, face, cheeks, -Smile -What is going on in here? Brother stuff. Oh look, Charlie, there's your little friend. Honey, when you let the guy go, you keep the toys! -Mr. Duncan. -Miss blankenhooper. Well, hello again. Listen, you should know that I'm happily married. Well, not happily. And not actually married. Tell Shirley all about it. Look, we found out that our marriage wasn't legal, And now we're fighting because I don't want to get remarried on vacation. I think she's being completely unreasonable. Look, doll, nobody ever said love was reasonable. And a little romantic gesture goes a long way. Thanks. That's actually pretty good advice. If it doesn't work out, you know where to find me. Okay. I'm walking away now. Mm-mm-mm. Mama like! Look, now that we're stuck up here, you have to listen to me. But, Spencer, we've already talked about everything. I miss you, Teddy. I miss us. I came up here because I want you back. No, you cannot be the one. The one what? Well, I met this psychic. And she told me I'd come face to face with the love of my life on this trip. And I keep running into you and Everything else she predicted came true, but Just I'm so confused. I'm not. Teddy, when I found out you were coming up here, Something told me I had to see you. -I don't know. -I do. And you do too. We're moving again. Yes, we are. Are you kidding me? We'll be lucky to finish second. There are only two teams. So you're following me. Attention, guests, The pairs skating competition will begin with our first team. P. J. And Gabrielle Duncan. It's Gabe. I'm a dude! Stop that! One, two, three, four. And arms arms, hands, grab. We need to do the cyclone of awesomeness. But I've never landed it. Now would be a good time to start. Out, face, cheeks, Smile. Nailed it. And our first place winner's P. J. and Gabrielle Duncan. What's so important? I don't know, front desk says they needed to see you. If it's anything the Duncan kids did, I'm Amy blankenhooper. Wow. Now I know this is going to seem kind of sudden. After the 19 years and the mortgage and all, But, um, hang on. Would you marry me Again? Well, Bob, I have some questions first. How many kids do you want? -Uh Four. -It's a deal. Hey, did you hear that? We got a yes! -May I give the bride away? -I'd be honored. Okay, Charlie, lead the way. It's not too late to back out. I love you. And I love you. Yay, congratulations! They haven't gotten married yet. Could we move it along? I just want to get to the cake! Oh man, I forgot to get a cake. Attention, guests, The wedding cake baking contest has just concluded. I love this guy. Uh, excuse me, excuse me. Hi, everyone. Hi. Um, I'd like to make a toast. To my husband Bob. Even after almost 20 years. Every time we kiss, I fall in love with you all over again. And I her. That's it? At's all you got? -Hey. -Hi. That was really sweet. Well, the first part. Yeah, it was. Um Listen, Spencer, I have I have to tell you something. -I really like you -I really like you too. Uh, but the thing is Wow, this is really hard. Um I think maybe we should just be friends. But what about all the stuff we talked about on the ski lift. And our kiss? Well, you know how my mom said. That every time she kisses my dad she falls in love again? Yeah. Well, when we kissed, I didn't feel that way. Oh. I mean, I used to, but this time I didn't. I'm sorry. Um, so what now? Friends? -Friends. -Hey, ladies! It's time to throw the bouquet. Awwww! Hey, so I guess you never saw the love of your life, huh? Nope, but guess what? I'm only 15. What's the rush? You couldn't realize that before I took a four-hour bus trip? I'm just glad I don't have to think about boys for a while. -Go get his number. -I'm on it. Well, Charlie, we're back home from your first family vacation, Where you also went to your first wedding Yep, mom and dad renewed their vows of love. Okay, who is Shirley and why is she calling here, Bob? I am in the phone book. Yep, as you can see, everything's pretty much back to normal. How many times have I told you?! You've gotta land the triple lutz. You're killing me! That's it, I quit! Where am I supposed to find another partner small enough to throw? Good luck, Charlie. I hear sometimes these things get stuck. When we get to the top, mind if I go first? I've seen you ski. You're not very good. I could flick you off here like a booger. A psychic told me I'd meet the love of my life on this trip. Did your family had money? I don't even know what money is.
Okay, Charlie, what do you say when you get in trouble? Uh-oh. Oh, Charlie just made an uh-oh? I just changed you. No, Charlie didn't do anything. I'm just sampling her. sampling means I'm recording all the words she says. So I can play them back. Oh, we used to do that. We called it tape-recording. Check it out. Mine, yes, no,cookie, Nana. Dad, you promised you'd take me driving today. To be fair, I promise a lot of things I don't deliver on. Yeah, but you can't keep putting this off. My driver's test is in three days,and you haven't taken me out once. No, I know, I know. You explained it all to me. While I was trying to read in the bathroom. You were outside the door while dad was in the bathroom? That's how much I want it. Bob, take her driving already. All right, fine. Let's go. Boy, I tell you, nothing good ever happens when I leave the bathroom. Bye-bye. Bye bye bye-bye. - What's that?- Just in case you don't make it back. P. J. , what did you get Teddy for her birthday?. - Birthday? - Your sister's turning 16. We're having a surprise party for her tonight. Well, it's working, 'cause I'm surprised. The party starts at 7:00. You have to get her a present,and something nice. - How about? - Not another sock puppet. You have to get her something too. Whoa whoa, what did I just walk into? Mom says we have to buy Teddy a birthday present. What about a dog? I bet she'd like a dog. I'm serious. You have to get her something. What about a dog? I bet she'd like a dog. Gabe, is there a dog in my house? Maybe. He followed me home, mom. Can we keep him? No. I've told you 100 times I do not want a dog in this house. Mom, please. Horsy. No, honey. It's actually a doggie. Who just made a horsy-sized uh-oh. Sorry, Teddy. I've made my decision and it's final. Dad, that's so unfair. Mom, dad says I can't get my license. - What? Why not?- Because she's not ready. Well, my driving instructor thinks I am. He says I'm doing great. The man works for the public schools. He's got nothing to live for. Mom, can you say something? Teddy honey, I'm sorry, But your father has a very small area of authority And unfortunately for you, Teaching you kids to drive is part of it. So what else is in that area? Barbecuing. That's it. Dad, please. I really want to get my license the day I turn 16. Look, it's not gonna happen, all right? So until further notice,there's gonna be no driving. Sorry. Can I have the keys, please? Here. I can't believe I stood outside the bathroom door for this. Hey. You're on my side, right? - Honey. - Yeah? Why am I talking to a dog? He followed Gabe home. But don't worry. I made it very clear. We are not keeping him. Hey, you know something? He kind of reminds me of your Uncle stan. - What? - The wet nose and the bloodshot eyes. Come on, he Oh, now I see it. P. J. , I have a question. Was dad out of control when he was teaching you how to drive? No no, he was very mellow. Then what is his problem? Well, hair loss, kills bugs for a living There's so much to choose from. Well, whatever it is, why did he have to take it out on me? I don't know. Maybe you're a bad driver. No, I'm a good driver. I was the only kid in driver's ed. Who didn't barf during the splattered brains movie. Actually I have a question for you. I have a friend who is turning 16. And I have to buy her a birthday present. Mm, well I know your friend wouldn't want a sock puppet. Okay. Well, what would she want? Well, She'd probably like boots, Like from that cool store at the mall, But not the black ones with the purple trim. She already has those. I'm just guessing. Oh hi, Mrs. Dabney. I see you people have a dog now. Oh, I'm doing fine, thanks.How are you? Let me explain something to you. Your dog makes my Cat nervous. And when my Cat gets nervous, I get nervous. And when I get nervous, Mr. Dabney gets nervous. Then what happens? Mr. Dabney goes to stay with his mother. So this dog thing is not entirely bad. All right, we're done here. Oh, Mrs. Dabney,before you go, Um, I need some more practice hours. Before I take my driver's test, So if you ever need a chauffeur, I'm your girl. Let's go. Right now? I've got a bunch of errands to run. And if you drive, I can play word jumble on my cell phone. Actually I do that anyway,but this way it's legal. This store only has girls in it. Yeah. So what's Teddy's shoe size? I don't know. You don't know her shoe size? I don't know her middle name. Well, dude, how are we supposed to buy her shoes? Wait a minute. Teddy wore your sneakers by mistake last week, right? - Yes. - That means you're the same size. Here, try these on. Oh no. I am not putting on girl boots. Oh, come on. They'll look good with that girl shirt you're wearing. It's not a pony. It's a stallion. Fine, I'll put them on for two seconds. Buying boots for my sister. Funny story she and my brother have the same size feet. Good thing she didn't want underwear, right? Okay, see you. Okay, they fit. Whoa, hold on, dude.You've gotta stand up, Walk around, make sure they're comfortable. Come on. Wow, those do wonders for your legs. Okay, that's enough. They won't come off. What?Let me try. Why are your feet so fat? They're not fat. They're husky. What are we gonna do? Well, there's only one thing to do. - Who are you calling? - No one. I'm taking a picture of you in girl boots. The light's not getting any greener. I know, but the car in front of me hasn't moved yet. Here's a quick driving lesson. Wake up, grandpa! Sorry, that was her, not me. Oh look, grandpa's telling us we're number one. No, he's not.He's I know what he's doing. So we should probably head home now, right? Just one more stop boulder. I want to see my sister. Boulder?That's in the mountains. Oh, you got one of those flat-land-only driving permits? No, it's just I have to be home by 7:00. Oh, and we should probably stop for gas. In this car you can drive 100 miles on empty. I'll tell you when we need gas. Now we need gas. Yeah, just one problem We're in the middle of nowhere. And it looks like rain. Agh! And there's a crazy woman outside my window. So actually we got three problems. Hello. Kinda hard to talk with the window open just a crack. Sorry. What are y'all doing over here? We're out of gas. Well, this is your lucky day. There's gas and such down the road a spell. Oh, how far is a spell? 50 miles. Of course, I got a gallon of gas right here. Great.How much is it? 50 bucks. The mountain lady's got an angle. I also got gum, mints, magazines. I could keep you up to date on all things Justin bieber. Oh. Charlie. Charlie, hand mommy the tape. Fine. It'll just be a sweet 6 party. What are you drawing? Are you making a pretty picture? What do you want, dog? Horsy. What are you doing? What are you doing?You cannot be here. You're kind of sweet. Okay, just for a minute. You're not such a bad dog, are you? No, you're a good dog. I'm gonna call you sweetie-pie 'cause you're a sweetie-pie. - Mommy. - Charlie, not now. Yes. Mom, we have got a big problem. Oh, you sure do. Those boots do not go with those shorts. You are working my last nerve. She is a handful. Does any of this look familiar? Looks like the same road we drove down 10 minutes ago. So I'm just going in circles. And you didn't want to say anything? I thought my annoyed silence was speaking volumes. Okay. Well, we're lost. And we need to look at a map.Do you have a map? On my cell phone. But I'd have to turn off my word jumble. Okay. What did you do now? I think we're in some kind of hole. Well, then one of us is gonna have to get out and push The one of us who's 16. I'm not 16 yet. - Get out. - Okay. Okay, hit it, but try to go Slow. Okay, go again, but this time. Try to go a little bit slower. Oh. Well, this would be a great time. For the mountain lady to come by with some skirts. Hey, sweetie. - Hi. - Hi. I think you found my dog. Um, we don't have a dog here. Really? I found this flyer with your address on it. Must be a misprint. No dog. Bye-bye. Mom, mom, can I talk to you for a minute? Hi, we'll be right with you. Okay. Look, mom, we've got to do the right thing here. If you want a dog,we can get you another one. I don't want another dog. I want my sweetie-pie. Mom, he already has a family. Who loves him and misses him. He needs to go home. I know. Goodbye, sweetie-pie. I will never forget you. Winston! Thank you. You're welcome. I'm very very proud of you. Now how about we go get you some ice cream? - Okay. - Yes, come on. Oh, you guys, Teddy's here. Everybody hide. Hide. Surprise! Aww. Oh, okay. I know what you're thinking Teddy can wear anything. Oh, um Why don't I go clean up. And we'll try this again in 30 minutes, okay? Oh, one more thingyou guys! - Great cake, mom. - I got it at the store. I know. That's why I said great cake, mom. Dad, what are you doing out here? Just thinking.Are you enjoying your party? Yeah, it's awesome. Thank you so much. Dad, I have to tell you something. You spent the afternoon driving with Mrs. Dabney. You got all that from I have to tell you something? No, actually I got all that. From when Mrs. Dabney returned your skirt. Now you know I told you I didn't want you driving. I know. I'm sorry. All right, you know what? Let's just talk about this tomorrow. - Dad, I'm a really good driver. - Teddy. No, why are you treating me different than P. J. ?. You didn't freak out on him when he was learning how to drive. Because teaching P. J. to drive was a completely different thing. - Why? - Because it was. - Why? - Because he's P. J. You're my little girl. Driving means leaving. And once you get in that car, You go. Dad. Look, I'm sorry, okay? You've got your party and stuff going on. I shouldn't be talking about this stuff. Dad, it's sad to think. All your kids are gonna leave someday. Well, actually to be perfectly honest, With P. J. I'm kind of worried he's never gonna leave. Yeah, well, We'll hope for the best. Dad, I want you to know that even though I'm gonna get in that car and drive away someday, I'm also gonna drive back home. Yeah, probably with a trunkful of laundry. Yeah. And now P. J. And Gabe.

That's the sound we make If we march in circles and watch you play along Just sit down, annoy your mom and sing the gurgle song, gurgles! It's kind of annoying, but I guess it's entertaining to your little brain. Oh, the gurgles! What did I miss? -I love gurgles. -Shh! So if we're having a contest for who gives Charlie the best birthday present ever, I'll accept my prize now. Okay well, I gave her the gift of life, so let's see what you got. I'm getting her tickets to the gurgles concert. -Oh! -Yeah. I want her to have a great second birthday, unlike mine when I didn't get the gift I wanted. Here we go, still whining about a hello doggy. Howdy puppy, the rootinest tootinest little chihuahua in the West. I wanted him more than anything in the world and I Oh, too soon. Hey, how are you coming with the entertainment? Entertainment. Entertainment? For Charlie's birthday party. -What did you decide on? -Ah. Still thinking. Noodling. A lot of things going on in the old hopper. The hopper's empty, isn't it, Bob? I I don't even know where it is anymore. Honey, Charlie's party is in three days. Oh, honey, come on, relax. I'll think of something. Okay, we'll do a clown, a bouncy house whatever. Bob, honey, you have to reserve those things. We have to decide on something good or it's gonna be hello doggy all over again. Howdy puppy! -Hey, can I check my email? -No no no no no. I'm about to buy gurgles concert tickets online. They go on sale in eight seconds and I'm gonna be the first one to get them. Okay, here we go. Three, two, one. What? Sold out?! Oh, you've gotta be kidding me. Hang on. Let me get in there. Let's see. -What are you doing? -Checking my email. What? Give me that. How am I gonna get the tickets now? Well, the other day I was listening to that radio station for kids, K. I. D. Z. Hey, kidz. I just got that. Why are you listening to the kidz radio station? Because they told me not to change the channel. Anyway, they're having a contest. Whoever makes the best video wins tickets to the gurgles concert. We could make a great video. All we need is one good idea. Oh okay, how about this? So we make a video of me putting on 200 pairs of underpants. And then I turn around and on my butt it says. I heart the gurgles. Yeah, that's not it. I've I've got an idea. I've written some really great kid songs. We could turn one of those into a video. One good idea. Just one good idea. I have got a song about talking toes that will knock your socks off. You get it? Cause it okay. Okay, we're still going through all the bad ideas. But we need a good one, and Charlie should be the star of it. Well, I've always wanted to shoot her out of a cannon. All right, still emptying out all those bad ideas, okay. No cannons? No underpants? You're really tying my hands here. Hey hey, honey! Honey! Hey, come on. Come in here. Come on. -I've got something I wanna show you. -What is it? I wanna show you the entertainment I got for Charlie's party. Voila. A little cart. This is why I'm missing judge ira? Oh my, I seemed to have put the cart before the Horse! Are you sure it's a horse? I've seen bigger dogs. Actually, I've seen bigger cats. Honey, it's a miniature horse. Well, he is kind of cute. -Where did you find him? -At the stables. You know, I was gonna get a pony, and then I met this guy in the parking lot who said, Have I got a deal for you. And well, after I said no thank you to the speakers, he brought out shamrock here. Aw, he's adorable. Why is his tail going up? Oh. That was great. Hey, mom, we finished the video. -You wanna see it? -Oh, can't wait. Yeah, we are so gonna win those tickets. Gurgles! Good evening. I'm here with the world's biggest gurgles fan, miss Charlotte Duncan. Oh no, please call me Charlie. We're all friends here. So, Charlie, tell me how you first became acquainted with the gurgles. Well, I was 17 no, 18 months and I was doing a little bit of channel surfing. Boring, blah. Been there, seen that. Then ba-bam! The most wonderful collection of shapes and colors. -I had ever seen. -The gurgles. The gurgles indeed. And seeing them in concert would make me feel Well, why don't I just show you? Lights, please. -Wow, look at this. -Cool. Wow! Forgive me. I got a bit carried away. Now if we're done here, I was promised a juice box. You guys, that was amazing! Oh, mom, you made a brilliant Charlie. Oh, didn't I? Good show, good show. Again. -Yes? -Yeah. Hey, honey, you seen the garage door opener? Never mind. What are you doing? There's a mini-horse in our garage. Did you really think I wouldn't take advantage of that? Where did you go? Just down the street to Austin's house. He's been bragging about his new dog. This shut him right up. All right, come on. Get out of there, would you? Okay. Oh, here. There you go. -What is this? -Tickets. Did you know you can't text while riding a mini-horse? - Uh, Gabe - Yep? - You forgetting something? - Oh right. Hey, it's 3:00. The winning video should be up by now. I'm on it Hey, P. J. I didn't know you were working today. I'm not. This is my only clean shirt. Then why are you wearing the hat? I don't wanna look stupid. Oh, it's up. They've posted the winning video. Oh, I can't look. Okay, tell me we won. Tell me we won. Why aren't you telling me we won? - Because we lost. - What? I don't believe it. What video could possibly be better than ours? How much do I love the gurgles? Now at this point a jerk might say I told you so. I told you so! So now what are we gonna do? Go downtown to the piedmont hotel where the gurgles are staying and beg them for tickets? How do you know where they're staying? It was on the all things gurgles website. Am I the only one who reads that? Yes yes, because you're their only fan that can actually read. So you're just gonna knock on their door and they're gonna let you in? They will if we're delivering a delicious bucket of chicken. Or that stuff you deliver. Great! Let's go. Wait a minute. How are you gonna know - what room they're in? - 423. I'm an all things gurgles premium subscriber. You make a simple rule. You expect people to follow it. Gabe, she's  two. She can't hold it. Can we turn around now Actually, give me a second. Unbelievable. All right, would you please just finish the story? You still haven't told us how you got arrested. All right, so we went down to the hotel. Yeah, this is stan in 423. I can't find my remote control. No, I'm not sitting on it again. Never mind. It's open. I can't believe it. It's you! You're the circle! You want me to sign something Five bucks. You want it in sparkly pen, it's 10 bucks. No no, we're not here for autographs. We want to ask about concert tickets. - And we brought chicken. - Huh? Whoa whoa whoa, wait a minute. The other gurgles put you up to this? Are they testing me to see if I'll stay on my diet? Testing you? Don't all the shapes love each other and help each other out? - Yeah yeah, that's it. - Here you go. - So do you have any tickets? - No. You have any sides? No ticky, no chicky. P. J. , come on, let's go find a more helpful shape. I'll catch up with you. Listen, circ. - Heh, can I call you circ? - No. Uh, well, the thing is I am a musician and I wrote a song that is perfect for the gurgles. - You wanna hear it? - No no no, thanks. Triangle writes all our songs 'cause he's a genius. This will only take a minute, only take a minute. This is a song This is a song I wrote after I skinned my knee. What do you get when you pick a scab? Pick a scab, pick a scab. What do you get when you pick a scab? A scar that lasts forever. you wanna hear another one? No. Look, kid, I just want to be left alone and watch tv, okay? Aw, nuts. Okay, I'll be back in a little while. - Where are you going? - Taking the horse for a drive. I like to see people's faces when he sticks his tiny head out the window. Oh! Bob, get out here! The horse is gone. We've been rustled? Dag nabbit! you sure you wanna do this? I don't like the idea of sneaking into a concert, but there's no way I'm gonna let Charlie down. And besides, what's the worst that could happen? It's not like they're gonna throw us in jail. Okay, stop laughing. It's time to get sad. Think of something really sad. Okay. Oh, that's good. - Thinking of hey there, poochy?  - Howdy puppy. - Next. - Hi. - Ticket, please. - Um, quick story. - It's actually pretty sad. - Let me guess. You're trying to get tickets for your baby sister who's the biggest gurgles fan in the whole world and they were sold out, and now you want me to just let you guys in? It's even sadder when you say it. And here's the saddest thing of all. Next! Time to kick it up a notch. - Ready? - Ready. Oh oh oh! Help help! That boy just collapsed! It's okay. I'm a doctor. - I know mouth to mouth. - All better. Hi, I'm Bob Bob's bugs be gone. I'm here about the fire ant problem backstage. Exterminators, huh? Why do you have a baby with you? She's an intern. - You really think I'm that stupid? - No. - Hey, look over there. - What? Hey! Can I help you? - Animal control. - Good. What happened to your face? Chipmunks are only cute in cartoons, ma'am. Is this your horse? - Yes. You found him! - Hey! Oh my gosh, we've been worried sick. - Where is he? - Not so fast. I'm afraid this animal is stolen proper. What? We didn't steal it. My husband rented it for our daughter's birthday party. Just show me the rental agreement, we can clear this right up. I haven't got a rental agreement. I got a sweaty handshake and he took off in his dark van. Seemed okay to me. Then I'm afraid we have a problem. No no no, hon. Here's your rental agreement. Honey, I told you I didn't get one. Oh no, it's right here. Yeah yeah. As a matter of fact, he has two rental agreements. Are you trying to bribe me, ma'am? We also have cake. So that's how we got here, which only leaves P. J. How did you get here? Oh, cute story, actually. So it was after the concert. I can't believe I went to Yale. Now I'm a gurgle. I've got talkin' toes The big one likes to say hello The other four are not so bold They curl up when it gets too cold. That's great, kid. Oh, you like that one? I've got plenty of others One about talking eyes, one about talking knees Yeah, do you happen to have a song about security guards? That's not a good idea for a song. Oh. See you later, I'm off to jail Could you do me a favor and post my bail? Here's a gurglewho went to Yale  so I was busted for harassing a gurgle and stripped of my membership from the fan club. Okay, Duncans, you're free to go. You've been bailed out. - Bailed out? - By who? Gurgle circle. Yeah yeah, biggest moment of your life. But why did you bail us out? Well, I played pick a scab for the other gurgles and they loved it. - I sold a song? - No, i sold a song. You got bailed out. Welcome to showbiz, kid. You know, I'm gonna miss this place. Oh, don't worry, you'll be back. Well, Charlie, your second birthday turned out to be pretty memorable More memorable than my second birthday, that's for sure. Still too soon. Anyways, you never did get to see the gurgles in concert, but that's okay because you have a new favorite show. Ooh, the buttercups! But if you ever wanna see the buttercups in concert, good luck, Charlie. Shh! This is a new one. Hey, dad, do you mind if I take Charlie out for a spin? Ooh, sorry, Gabe. We don't have the horse anymore. But we do have the cart. Faster! Okay, say Cheese. Giddy up. Wow. You guys were gone a long time. Really? Seems like 30 seconds. Oh! Did you see anything interesting? No, just a bunch of credits.

I just opened up the phone bill. You are $90 over your texting limit. What have you got to say about that? I love you, daddy? Come on, Teddy, this is so irresponsible. I expect more from you. Hold on. I'm getting a text. No, you're not, 'cause I'm taking your phone away. What? No, you can't do that. Taking away my phone would be like taking away your pizza. You're fighting for your phone. By calling me fat? Well, I'm just really mad. I love you, daddy. I'll tell you what You'll get your phone back. -When you come up with 90 bucks. -That's so unfair. Hey dad. Uh, I gotta tell you something. What? Well, I was pulling into the garage. And I kind of scraped the bug truck. Instead of Bob's bugs be gone it now says Rob's rugs be gone. P. J. !. Yeah, dad? Try and be more careful. That's it? He gets try and be more careful and I get my phone taken away? Unbelievable! Whoa. She's a handful, eh, Rob?

Hey, guys, see you later. Are you taking Charlie somewhere? Yes, to the mall. We're going to go shopping. Shopping for what? Girls. They just can't resist our adorable little sister. I can't believe you'd use Charlie as girl bait. Oh, let him do it. Without charm or personality, it's his only play. Thank you. All right, just have Charlie back by 3:00. I'm taking her to a birthday party at Otto's grotto. Oh, no problem. Shouldn't take long. Hey, Charlie, say that thing I taught you. I wuv P. J. Wuv? She can say love. I know, but wuv gets me way more girls. Hey honey. -Hey. -What's wrong? Nobody to play video tennis with. All my friends are doing homework. Or spending time with their families Losers. I'll play with you. I think I'll go read a book. You'd rather read a book. Than play video games with your mom? Yeah, you're right. I'm gonna go take a nap. Gabe, I've played video games before. I know what I'm doing. Mom, that's the tv remote. Which I'm moving out of the way. So that I can pick up a controller. All right, serve it up, Sonny boy. Fine. This won't be any fun. Okay, are you ready? Go for it. Wow, this might be more fun than I thought. Where's Charlie? Where'd Charlie go? Oh, there she is. There she is. Yeah yeah yeah. Oh, wow. Maybe we should put that back. Mine. Well, they probably won't miss one ball. I count every ball every night! Can you zip me up? No. No, thank you. The girl that usually plays the mermaid she quit on me. She's now the Pickle at hamburger Hank's. Well, you knew her when. That Hank is killing me. With his fancy minimum wage. I can't believe I'm about to say this, but I could use a job. Okay, slow it down. It takes three things to work at Otto's grotto. -One you gotta be 16. -I am. Two you gotta be good with kids, which basically means willing to clean up their puke. I am, she said less excitedly. And most important, you gotta speak the language of the sea. The what? Like don't be crabby, kids. We're gonna have a whale of a time. Stuff like that. It's our hook. Whoa, I just did it again! Yeah, well, don't worry. I won't clam up on you. Well, you'll work on it. -When can you start? -The sooner the baiter. The first puke you clean up may be mine. Okay, Gabe, what do you think? Buttoned? Unbuttoned? Unbuttoned give those four chest hairs a chance to breathe. So you got a girl coming over? Yep, her name is Kayla. I met her at the mall. Charlie got you a girl? Yeah, worked like a charm Well, except Charlie got a little confused. Instead of saying I wuv P. J. She said, I wuv poopy. I think Charlie knew what she was saying. Yeah, but I totally saved it. I told Kayla my nickname was poopy. Kayla and poopy Many years of happiness, sir. Come on, boys, work your magic. -Hi Kayla. -Hi. -This is my brother Gabe. -Ooh ooh ooh! Charlie, there's my little sweetie. Hi. Come here. Have fun, poopy. So do you want to hang out downstairs? I have an even better idea. Ashes ashes, we all fall down. Oh my goodne, you're so good. Okay, who wants to play peek-a-boo? -Who wants to play peek-a-boo? -Actually, Charlie has to take her nap right now. Oh. Well, I guess I'll be going. Really? I thought we could have some Kayla and poopy time. Yeah, well, maybe next time. But this was a really good playdate. I guess, yeah. -Bye, Charlie. -Goodbye-bye. Who's gonna get a big kiss? I'm going in. -Ha! -Mom. -Ha! -Dad! -Ha! -Mom. -Ha! -Dad! Ha! Can you please make it stop? What are you doing? Practicing video tennis. Gabe crushed me today. You know, it's about 11:00.

Yeah, I am the puke-cleaning mermaid at Otto's grotto. But of course if you give me my phone back I can still quit. Be sure and wear gloves. Ha! Ha! All right, let's go. Come on, give me the controller. Not now. Mama's in the zone. Yeah, mama doesn't know where the zone is. Hey. Oh good. You're right on time. Yeah, well, it's my first day. I didn't want to leave you floundering. So where's my mermaid suit? No, that was for a girls' party. Today you are working a boys' party. They don't like mermaids. All right, so what do they like? Hey hey, stop that. Ollie octopus is not a pinata. I know. Pinatas are fun. Okay, guppies, grab your shoes Or any shoes. And join your parents outside. Hey, lock up for me, will you? Wait, what? And don't forget to count the balls. All right, you heard the man. Everybody out. Na na! Na na! Just wait till I get my tentacles on you. Hey, I'm stuck. Could you help me? No. Hello? Anybody? Kelp. Uh! I'm getting better, aren't I? Yeah, mom. That time you only lost 6-1. Hey hey, excuse me, what are you doing? I have to study for my history test tomorrow. Put that book down and pick up the controller. Dad, mom won't let me do my homework. You can do it when you finish playing. I am so confused. Fine. You know what? Finish your stupid homework. Call me when you get your priorities straight. Dad, dad, she's out of control. You have to talk to her. Why? Because when I tell her to do things, she does them? Haven't you been paying attention. To the way things work around here? Well, what am I supposed to do? Well, it's easy. Next time you play her, you let her win. Let her win? Have you ever seen her play? I'm not even sure that's possible. I'm sure you'll figure it out. All right, come on, get over there and study for your test. Oh, I made that test up just to get rid of her. -You want to play? -Yeah, sure. Hey Kayla. Are we going on a picnic? Yes, we are. I have animal crackers, juice boxes. And pb&j sandwiches cut into the shapes of stars. Wow, all my favorites. No, I brought them for Charlie, silly. Well, Charlie's not here. Mom took her to the playground. Oh. Well, let's go meet them there. You know what? I'm starting to think. That you'd rather spend time with Charlie than with me. What? That's crazy. Are you really jealous of a two-year-old? How can a hot guy like you. Be so insecure? -Okay, I'm feeling a little better. -Yeah. The hot guy part really helped. Hello? Teddy! In here. What? So how was your first day? Get me out of here. I'm stuck. Okay, all right. Don't worry. I'm coming in after you. Oh, man, wow. You know, if I had unlimited texting, this wouldn't have happened. Okay, I'm gonna try and push you out, okay? Now try pulling. Wow, you know what? You're really wedged in there, Teddy. All right, okay, I'm gonna I'm gonna go for help. Uh-oh. -Huh! -Ugh! Well, another good shot, mom. Is that a bell I hear? Cause you just got schooled. Are you trash-talking me? What's the matter? Can't take it? Gonna run home crying to your mommy? You are my mommy. And you are my loser! That's it. That's it, mom. Now I'm playing for real. -Let's do this. -Okay, let's to this. Where did you learn how to do that? I found some cheats on the Internet. Didn't think I knew about cheats, did ya? I didn't think you knew about the Internet. Dad, why are you banging your butt against the tube? I'm trying to butt-dial the house. It's number one on the speed-dial, so it should be easy. Ralph's pizza. You want your usual, bobby? The house is on speed-dial two. -Mom, phone. -You get it. No, you get it. Hi-yo. Charlie, Charlie, it's daddy, honey. Listen, go tell your mother we're stuck in a tube. At that kids' place at the mall. What's the name of this place? Dad, she's two. Good point. Charlie, go get your mommy. Bye-bye. Good going, dad. I'm not the one who got stuck in a tube. Well, I'm not the first one anyway. No, this is all your fault. If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't even need this stupid job. Hey, you're the one who went over her texting minutes. Actions do have consequences. Not for P. J. It's like you hold me to a totally different standard. Yeah, I treat you differently. But why? Look, Teddy, this isn't about P. J. This is about you. I have high expectations. That's why I'm tough on you. Dad, that's not fair. Oh, honey, look, I hold you to a high standard. Because you are capable of great things. I am? Well, in the future. Today you were defeated by an octopus costume. And a plastic tube. Thanks, daddy. What was that? That sounded like Whoa! Ow! How long have you two been down here? Quiet! I tried calling the house. In case anyone is interested, it was an emergency. Take that! -No no no no no! -What happened? Oh, this? This is for your own good. Well, we've been playing for six hours. I was about to win. I was about to win. Well, now we'll never know, because I'm taking this and putting it on a high shelf. I don't know, man. Maybe he's right. Maybe we did get a little crazy. Yeah. You know my friend Jake? He has the same game at his house. Nah, it's really late. I know where they hide the spare key. Meet you in the car. Hey, Kayla, it's P. J. It's, like, my fifth message. Where are you? -She's in the kitchen. -What? What is going on in here? I can explain. -Poopy, I -Don't you poopy me. You know, it's not what it looks like. Really? Because it looks like. You're having a playdate behind my back. I'm sorry, but it's Charlie is so cute. And then one thing led to another No, I think it would be best for everyone if you left. Charlie, don't let him do this. Say something. Bye-bye. How could you? I sorry. Oh, I can't stay mad at you. I wuv P. J. Save it for the mall. We're going back tomorrow. Hey, Charlie, it's your dad here. I'm filling in for Teddy. Because she's getting ready for her new job. She's working over at hamburger Hank's now, so no more silly octopus costumes for her. Dad, I'm ready. Can we go? You want to say something to your little sister? No no. Don't ever go over your texting limit. Unless you want to end up like me A dancing hot dog. Good luck, Charlie. What she said. What are you doing here? I'm missing a few things. The ball pit was a little light. You really count? Yes, I really count. You don't become a #4 kids' entertainment purveyor. In the Denver Metro area without counting! All right, well, we don't have any balls. Oh really? 'Cause, see, I noticed that your little sister. Had some sticky fingers. Fine. I'll ask. Charlie, do you know anything about some missing balls? Is that it, Charlie?
Come on, Charlie. Go tinkle-winkle. Make the poo-poo for the mama. No no? All right, I'll tell you what Five bucks for a number one, 10 bucks for a number two. All right? Uh uh uh, excuse me, what are you doing? Playing a video game. That's how kids. From our generation entertain themselves. Charlie is watching her favorite show. It's the only way we can get her to sit on the potty. Charlie has to watch the gurgles In order to do her business? Yes, the gurgles help Charlie. The same way that the sports section helps your dad. Look at this garbage Brightly colored singing and dancing shapes. Would you guys just go upstairs? If she isn't potty-trained by tomorrow, she won't get into the good preschool. -Come on! -But then we're gonna have to unhook the game system. Down here and rehook it up there. We already walked all the way down here. Are we supposed to rewalk all the way up there? You know, we wouldn't have this problem if we had a tv in our room. Okay, for the millionth time, I am not buying a tv for your room. Fine. Let's go, P. J. Ooh, hold on. The circle and the square are fighting over a grape. I want to see how this turns out.

No, they knew that. Oh, well, you know, It's too bad they didn't call. I could have given them a big discount. They knew that too. Oh. Okay. No biggie. What was that about? Who knows?

Charlie just threw some things in the toilet, clogged up the pipes. So I just gotta dig a little hole in the backyard, Clean out the main line. Don't worry. Everything is gonna be fine. Should I call a plumber? Absolutely not. I have got this all under control. Where's Charlie? I'll be right back. As long as he looks scared, I've done my job. Boys, would you turn down that tv in your room? Tv in your room? Oh, mama don't think so. What is this? A free tv. -Ha ha! -Isn't it awesome? It was just sitting on someone's lawn. Yeah, there was a sign that said please take, So we took. It's a little big for the room, don't you think? Yeah, it was at first, but then Gabe came up with the brilliant idea. Of bunk desks. Bunk desks. Right right. Where's your dresser? -Under P. J. 's bed. -Yeah, at first I was concerned. That getting a fresh pair of underpants every day was gonna be a little tricky. But then I came up with a solution The underpants pillow. -Bam! -Buh-bam! Every time I come in here I regret it. Oh! Oh oh oh! Argh! Argh! Uh-oh. What happened? The power went out and the plumbing. Well, how did that happen? Let's ask the soaking wet man with the pickaxe. Hey, everybody. Dad, when is the power coming back on? Yeah, I'm 15 minutes away from a video chat. And if we're gonna potty-train Charlie, she has to watch the gurgles. Uh, first of all, I'm fine. What? No, didn't get electrocuted. Thanks for the concern. What about the water? All right, I've already called the plumber and the electrician Oh, there we go. Okay. Who can't be here until tomorrow -What? Bob! -Ish. Come on. Hey hey hey! We can survive one night without water and power. Come on, it's gonna be fine. I heard some kind of explosion and rushed right over. To see if Gabe was anywhere near the blast. I'm right here, Mrs. Dabney, Better than ever. Are you sure? No internal injuries? My stomach is kind of upset. Might be a touch of dabnerrhea. All right. Mrs. Dabney, you know,. We're gonna be without water and power for a while. It sure would be helpful if we could use your bathroom. Till ours is up and running. I don't even let Mr. Dabney use my bathroom. Okay, Mrs. Dabney, I know it's an imposition, But the thing is we have a really important. Preschool interview tomorrow morning. And it sure would be nice if we could use your bathroom. To freshen up beforehand. -Need to freshen up, huh? -Yeah. I hear the bus station has a real nice bathroom. Have a good night now. Gabriel Duncan! Dabnerrhea? Yeah. Up top. Bob. Hey. Remember when you said we wouldn't need this? Who looks stupid now? Which question should I answer first? Any progress on the potty-training? Nope, without the gurgles Charlie won't even sit on that potty, And the interview is in 12 hours. Oh, she'll get it. That's the thing about us Duncans We're clutch players. I see the light's on. I'm not sure anybody's home. Where are the kids? Charlie's taking a nap. Teddy and Ivy are downstairs. And the boys are in their room reading. P. J. And Gabe are reading?. Yeah, it was their idea. So they're reading voluntarily? Huh. Let's roll. Oh! Sorry, I should have warned you about that. What is going on in here? Great news the power is back on. Well, it is for us. Where are you getting your power from? Hey, are you stealing electricity from Mrs. Dabney? Are we in trouble? What's taking those nachos so long? There really is a lot of stuff plugged in. Are you sure this is safe? Ah, the problem. We've got a loose connection. Everything's under control. Huh, that's weird. Mrs. Dabney's power is out too. Oh look, here she comes. You know, for an older gal, she moves pretty fast. Nachos? Raymond will think I blew him off. I probably lost him forever. Now I'm gonna die sad and alone. Ivy, you're not gonna die alone. You can live with me and my husband. In our pool house. No offense, but that sounds awful. Well, not for me. I have a husband and a pool house. You could just call Raymond. Mom, we can't do that. Our cell phones are dead and we can't charge them. Use the wall phone. It works without electricity. The wall what? The wall phone You know, the phone. On the wall. When did we get that? When we bought the house. Just one problem Raymond's number is in my phone. Well, if you know his last name, -Just look him up in the phonebook. -The phone what? Okay, now you can see what it was like. To live life in the olden days, Also known as the 9os. Huh. Here's Raymond's number. -What? -Yeah. Okay. Oh, it's right there. Oh, right here? It's ringing. -I can't do this. -Ivy. -I'm just not ready. -Don't give it to me. What am I supposed to? Hello. Raymond, hi. Hi, it's Teddy. Ivy's best friend. Yeah, I'm sure you've heard all about me. Oh really? Not a thing? Anyways, Sorry we missed the video chat. There were some technical difficulties, So I don't know if you and Ivy are gonna be able to talk tonight, Unless unless you want to come over. Ivy loves the idea. Ivy's at 358 edgewood. Okay, bye.

Okay, hey, Charlie, you want to watch some tv? -Yeah. -I bet your favorite show is on. I bet yeah. It's time to giggle With the gurgles! Hi there, kids. Today is gonna be a super-duper day. Why is that? Because we're gonna do the potty rap. Hey there, kids, don't be naughty Let's have fun and use our potty Going to the potty can be so gnarly Especially if you're a girl named Charlie. Oh gosh, mommy. Well, that didn't work. Actually it worked for me. See ya. -Hi. -Hi. -I'm Raymond. -Hi, I'm Teddy. Come on in. Ivy, Raymond's here. It's kind of dark in here. Yeah, we're having a power outage. Could I offer you some chunky milk. Or a glass of ice cream? Uh, I'm cool. Can I use the bathroom? No. The water's out too. Oh, nice place. I'm gonna see what's keeping Ivy. Just have a seat right there. Ivy! Enjoying myself so far. What's going on? What if I say something stupid? Then he won't like me. Ivy, you say stupid stuff to me all the time. And I still like you. I'm serious, t. This is the first guy I've ever really liked. I don't want to mess it up. Come on, you can do this. I can't. I just know if I look into those big brown eyes I'm gonna freeze. So you don't want to see his eyes. I can work with that. Ivy will be right out. Meanwhile, let's enjoy. Some nice battery-powered music Kicking it old school. Like they did back in the diz-ay. Oh, Teddy, right. Ivy did mention you. Okay, Ivy, come on out. There she is.

To stop off at the bus station to freshen up. Oh, so it's my fault? My stink is your fault, yeah. That makes a lot of sense. Tonight when we're done here I'm gonna drop you off at the bus station.

Unless I've met the boy, the answer's no. And I'm sure Teddy's mom said the same thing. Oh well, actually I haven't asked my mom yet. Oh hey, why don't I call my mom at work and see what she says?

Well If it's okay with Mary Lou, it's okay with me. Ooh, thank you, mommy! Love you so much. Yeah No one loves mom more than when she's saying yes. That was an interesting phone call. Was it? Yeah. Yeah, it was. Having fun yet, kid? No, vern, I am not. First time in a crawl space? I can't believe my dad does this for a living. I'm really gonna have to start paying attention in school. Shh! Uh-oh, rats. Rats? I thought we were catching possums. Sometimes the critters make the decisions. - Where are the rats? - All around us. dozens. Maybe hundreds. Quiet. If they smell fear, We're both dead. That was horrifying. Pass the salt, kid. Uh, that's termite poison. You only put that on a sandwich once. Whoops. Sorry. Well, it's nice to finally meet you. Your dad sure talks about you a lot. -He does? -All the time. Goes on and on about you-- how you're smart, Driven, popular. -He said all that about me? -Oh yeah. He's very proud. Well, lunch break's over, Ted. Ted? Ted?! Oh, Teddy's my sister. Oh, then you must be the self-confident Sharp-as-a-tack mischief-maker. That's Gabe. Hmm.

Everyone else is sharp, Smart and adorable And I'm just nice? I know what'll turn that frown upside down. You get to carry the rat bag. -Hi, Amy. -Hi, Mary Lou! Come on in. - Okay. - What brings you here? Ivy forgot her boa. Now if she's going to a party, she needs her boa. They just left, but don't worry-- The leopard-print dress will be festive enough. I gotta say, Amy, I was a bit surprised You gave Teddy permission to go to that party. Well, I only said yes to Teddy because you gave Ivy permission first. You know how much I respect you as a mother. Cracker? Oh, thank you. But you gave Teddy permission first And I said yes because of how much I respect you. Okay, yeah yeah yeah, best moms ever. I'm trying to watch my cartoons here. I-- I didn't give Teddy permission first. But I heard Teddy call you at work. No, Teddy never called me at work. I'm confused. -Yeah, me too. -May I enlighten you? -Spill it. -The girls used a phone app to make it sound like You each gave them permission to go to the party. -What? -They didn't! Oh, Mary Lou, but they did. Now, mom, so next time I'm bad-- we both know there will be a next time-- Just remember this moment when I did something for you. They are gonna be in so much trouble when they get home. Why wait till they get home? They're not the only ones who know about apps. No, they aren't. What do we know about apps? I have a g. P. S. App on this phone. That means I can track Ivy's phone. Shall we go to a party? I'd be appy to. hello? Teddy dear, Gabe here. Before I share the news, let's remember this moment the next time I need a favor. Why do all of your calls start with the same creepy question? Mom and Mrs. Wentz know all about the phony phone calls. What?! How'd they find out? That part remains a mystery. Anywho They're tracking you on g. P. S. And heading your way. What?  Our moms are tracking us on g. P. S. G. P. S. ? They're not supposed to know about that. Oh gosh, thanks, Gabe. I owe you one. So it would seem. There you are. I think Charlie wants to play baby with you. She keeps going, gabe, Gabe! She can say it all she wants. It's not gonna happen. I'm sick of her and I'm sick of that stupid doll. Oh, Charlie, come on! I didn't mean it. I was just Gabe being Gabe. Hey, there he is! How'd it go today? the highlight of my day Was carrying a bag of rats. Vern must like you because he's awful particular about his rat bag. Vern told me what you said about us kids. -What'd I say? -That everyone else is so great And I'm just nice. So? You're nice, what's wrong with that? So nice is what your friend calls the ugly girl He wants you to go out with. Is that all I am to you-- An ugly girl? Oh, this is so exciting-- Going after the perps. Wait, the girls are turning around. - What? - Looks like they're headed back to your house. Hold on your your purse, Mary Lou. We're making a u-ey. Oh yeah! - You know what would be great? - What? If we had a siren and a flashing light. They got app for everything. Hey. -I think we gotta talk. -I'm not in the mood. Oh, that wasn't very nice. Oh come on. When I said you were nice that was a compliment. That was the best thing you could say about me? I think that says a lot. Look, P. J. ,. As a father, the most important thing to me Is that my kids are good people-- Kind-hearted, genuinely concerned about other people Nice. Hey, by that standard you're the kid I'm most proud of. -Really? -Really. Thanks, dad. Hey, thank you for helping me out on the job today. Uh, you know, I was kinda Hoping maybe someday we could Make that a permanent thing. Duncan & son. Oh! That reminds me-- better hit those books. Well, that wasn't nice at all. Oh, what are you two doing here? Did the party end early? No, we decided not to go. The truth is We tricked you into giving us permission to go to the party. Did you now? Yes, I'm ashamed to say we did. But on the way there something made us change our minds. And what's that? We saw the grape juice billboard. You know the one where the girl is hugging her mom Because she's so happy with the juice? grape moms think alike, I'm familiar with it. Anyway that got us to thinking about how wonderful you two are And we talked it over and agreed that you deserved better And decided not to go. It's true. Anyway, we know you're probably gonna punish us, But we're okay with that. Well, we can talk about that later. I'm really proud that you guys told us the truth. I am too. Darn you for raising us so well. It's what I do. Hey, Ivy, I'm on my way out. Are you here? I'm right in front of your house. Are you sure it's not too late to go? Oh, girlfriend, these senior parties go all night. -Going somewhere? -Back to bed. You got that right. Caught by mom. Can't go. -If you're not going, I'm not going. -You got that right. Hi, Charlie. Charlie, come on. How many times do I have to say I'm sorry? What is it gonna take for you to forgive me? You baby. you baby? What does that mean? Well, Charlie, I don't know how you got him to do that, But thank you. We'll be enjoying this for years. now say good luck, Charlie. Do you want me to spit up? cause I'm not afraid to go there. Cranky baby. Hey, how's it going? Good good. Remember a few weeks ago I mentioned something about Cashing in my favors? Well, today's the day. You two never saw me. Bye-bye now. come in.

I was being insulted and you should have defended me! I couldn't too busy being embarrassed by you. What's going on? Ask the woman who just got kicked out of the grocery store. I was standing in the 15-items-or-less line. -Just minding my own business -With 17 items.  When this crazy woman in line behind us. Starts screaming at me to get out of line. Your mother handled it well though. Grabbed the pricing gun, scanned the woman's face. And through this entire ugly confrontation. Your father stood there, like an oaf, eating a donut. I was trying to get us down to 15 items. P. J. , tell your father. That I will not be speaking to him. Until he apologizes for not backing me up. Okay. Teddy, tell your mother I will not apologize.

Thank you, honey. Hey hey hey hey! Didn't you forget something? I'm not gonna do it every time. Bob, do you think we should get something for Charlie to play on, like a swing set or slide? She doesn't need any of that stuff. She's got all sorts of things to do back here. Really? Honey, look at her. Honey, she's using her imagination. In her mind, that stick, it's a sword. It's a magic wand. - What you got there, Charlie? - A stick. Which you are pretending is a Stick. P. J. , there's something we need to talk about. Oh no, I knew this was gonna happen. You wanna break up, right? Oh, no no no, I think things are going really well. Me too. It's just that we've been seeing each other for three weeks and we haven't even gone out on our first date yet. Oh. Yeah, you're right. We've only been out with friends. Yeah, and I think you learn a lot about a person on a first date. Like what? Like sometimes their name. Or if the relationship is meant to be. - Really? - Yeah. An awesome first date sets the tone for the entire relationship. I saw it on a cover of a magazine. Just the cover? Did you read the article? No, I'm not a big reader. We are so right for each other. Unh-unh-unh. How do I know until we've had our first date? Okay, all right, well, where do you wanna go on our awesome first date? What date? No one's asked me out yet. - Hint hint. - Right. Right, okay. Well, Skyler, would you like to Oops, I think my earring just fell out. - Uh-oh. - Do you see it? No. Wait. Wait. Oh, yeah, here it is. Got it. Where was I? Oh, yeah. Skyler, would you - P. J. , what are you doing?! - Dad, I was. I was about to ask Skyler a very important question. You're 17 years old. You work at kwikki chikki. You wanna ruin your life forever? I was just gonna ask her out on a date. Oh. Have fun. Li'l tots forts o' fun Charlie is gonna love this. Now let's rip this baby open and slap her together. Whoa whoa whoa. Slow down. Slow down. Before we do any ripping and slapping, we're gonna read the directions. Bob, that always takes forever. Honey, the directions are the difference between a fort and firewood. We don't need directions. All we have to do is look at the picture on the box and make that. Just look at the picture and make that. Well, that explains your cooking. I'm gonna go get some reading glasses. Do not touch anything until I get back. I won't. Take your time. Stop! Whoa whoa whoa, stop stop! What are you doing? I'm making these two pieces fit. I almost got it. No no, no more kicking. We have to read the directions. We don't have to read the directions to know that this piece fits into this piece pretty much. - Gimme this. - No, would you just let me do this. Gimme this. You don't know what you're doing, and somebody might get hurt. Are you okay? Because I'm seeing three of you right now and I don't even wanna see one of you, I'm gonna let you build this by yourself. Thank you. From all of us. Gabe, are your parents coming or not? Mrs. Monroe, how many fingers am I holding up? - Three. - Yeah, they're on their way. - Hello. - Mom! There you are, you little scamp.

I really need an answer on that mustache. Fine. I was pretending to be a british version of you. So you got a question about dating. Yeah, I gotta come up with something great for Skyler, but I don't have any ideas. How about a moonlight picnic? You can drive up into the mountains, look out over the lights of the city. Sounds romantic. - Yeah. - I like it. Thanks, dad. - Hey, dad. - Hey. Why are you wearing a fake mustache? Why aren't you wearing one?

Ryan Reynolds. Do it in your head. I don't know. I kinda got the vibe that maybe you don't wanna introduce me to your family. No, it's not that I don't want them to meet you. It's that I don't want them to meet your motorcycle and your biker boots and your leather jacket with the skull on it. Teddy, I don't wanna be somebody you have to hide from your parents. - Zac Efron! - Come on! You know what? I like you the way you are. That's all that matters. So come over tomorrow night and I'll introduce you. Cool. - Here you go. - Thank you, mother. That's Gabe's mother. And that's not her husband. Relax, maybe they're just friends. Or not.

Which is fine with me cause this is fun. Whoo-oo! Whoo-oo! You aren't whooing. That's because I don't feel very well. Maybe you're just hungry. Take something out of the picnic basket. Or put something in. Your choice. Help! Help! Gabe, Gabe, watch Charlie! Bob! What happened? I don't know. I was just standing here admiring the swing set You know, the one you put together all by yourself And then boom! The whole thing came down on top of me. - Are you okay? - I don't know. I just I feel so sleepy. No no no. No, Bob, stay with me. Stay with me. Amy, just know that no matter what happens to me, I don't blame you for the way you put this thing together. - I'm gonna go get help. - No no! Let me. Tim. Oh, you know Tim, right? Of course I do. Hi, Tim. - How you doing? - Hi, Mrs. Duncan. Bob Duncan, how dare you scare me like that! Well, you deserved it for lying to me. What? So now I can't lie to you? I thought we had a good marriage going here. Here's the bill for taking it apart. Thank you. Oh, could you put this back together again please? Sure, then tomorrow you want me to come back and take it apart again? No. Gosh, Tim, we're not crazy. I am so glad you're giving me a second chance. Let's just pretend our first date never happened. What first date? The one where I puked in the picnic basket. No, it's an expression. Puked in the picnic basket's an expression? I don't think that's gonna catch on. Excuse me. Mrs. Monroe, what are you doing here? Mr. Duncan, you've seemed to have lost your accent. It comes and goes. Ah, there it is. Pip pip. And you've lost your mustache too. That's right. Me mustache went cheerio. Mr. Duncan, I have disturbing news. It's about your wife. Your wife? You have a wife? - No. - You don't? Of course I do. - Who are you? - I'm his girlfriend.

Dial it down. Mrs. Monroe, if you'll excuse us, this family has some healing to do. Which I would like to do just with my parents and their dates. Stay warm, love. Don't wanna freeze off your English muffins. Grandma, grandpa! What's going on? I'm Gabe's teacher. I came to talk to his parents. We're his parents. That's right, grandpa. You're my dad. He thinks he's the president too. - Who are you? - Hey, I'm Derek. - Just a friend. - Is that your motorcycle? - Yeah. - No - I love motorcycles. - We're dating, me and Derek. Will you stop throwing that in my face? - We're done with that part. - Jolly good. Hey, Charlie. Well, we all got grounded for pretending to be mom and dad, but there's some good news. Looking good, Mr. Duncan. Oh, please, call me Bob. Yeah, turns out I was worried about nothing. My new boyfriend is dad's new best friend. Maybe I do have something to worry about. And things are cool between me and Skyler, after I explained I wasn't married to my sister. Yeah, that would have been awful. - Talk about puke in the picnic basket. - Right. - What? - Oh, it's an expression. Yeah. - Whoopsie. - My bike! Oh, well, that should put a dent in the old friendship. And of course, your swing set has now collapsed three times. Good luck, Charlie. - What are you doing? - Sorry to trouble you, governor, but I'm visiting the States from the u. K. And me auto seems to have broken down in front of your house.

Oh, how funny. Heh heh. -Guess I must have -Mentioned that before. Anyway, when I was reporting, I had this really cute catchphrase. It went a little something like this: I'm Amy Blankenhooper, gettin' all up in your news. Morning. Ooh, pancakes. Yay. Uh, maybe I'll pick up something on the way to work. When he won't eat it, that's a bad pancake. Has anyone seen my boots? Looks like Charlie has. That's adorable! Miss Duncan, are you aware that dad sometimes. Has to pour sweat out of those boots? Ew. Out of the mouths of babes. -This is Teddy Duncan -And Amy Duncan -Mom, it's a fork. - Gettin' all up in your news.

Oh, hey, sis. You want to sit together? Yeah sure, I'd love to. -Oh, it never gets old. -Yeah. Oh, wait. Is that Dustin Reese? Who's dustin Reese? We went to kindergarten together. Back then he had a ponytail until Why'd you cut off his ponytail? It was my first day with scissors. I had eaten a doughnut. I was out of my mind. -So do you think he remembers you? -I hope not. Well, here he comes. What you could have just turned around. Eh. Okay, everyone, welcome to the South high. Action news team, or shant. Anyway, I wanted to apologize for postponing the meeting. As you know, I fell off my bike Again. Who laughed? Me. I was thinking about something else. -And what was that? -The first time you fell off your bike. Moving on. All right, one of you. Is going to have a big opportunity. The channel 8 news is looking for a teen reporter. For an internship which includes a chance to appear on tv. If you're interested, have a two-minute piece on my desk by Friday Something juicy, explosive, hard-hitting ow. I'll pick the best one and submit it to channel 8. Now get to work. -Oh, and Teddy, was it? -Yeah. You're new around here. A piece of advice Don't fall in love with me. I shan't. Bob, Bob, big news. Walt Mcguire called and invited us. -Out to dinner at his country club. -Who is Walt Mcguire? Honey, he's the hospital administrator. I talk about him all the time. And I listen about him all the time. Ooh ooh ooh. You know what? I'm going to wear that dress that makes people ask if I'm Teddy's sister. Come on, honey, has anybody ever I love that dress. You know what? I think I'm going to buy a new pair of shoes too. And you might want to try on your suit. Why would I want to do that? You might have put on a little weight. Since our homecoming dance. Thank you for saying might have. -P. J. ! -Dustin. What are you doing here? Do you remember me from kindergarten? I I don't know. It was it was a long time ago. And which year of kindergarten? I want to show you something. Come on out. -What's all this? -I came to give you a haircut. Oh. Oh well, that's very nice of you, But I always go to Rachel at crazy cuts. -Not anymore. -What do you mean? Ahh! No! Oh. Why do I always have nightmares when I nap on this couch? Eh, five more minutes. -Why are you sitting with me? -Because I didn't realize it was you. Why are you dressed like that? -I don't want Dustin to recognize me. -Oh, the ponytail kid? You're worried he's going to get back at you? He has gotten into my dreams, my nap dreams. That is a place filled with gumdrops and lollipops. -He does not belong there! -Okay. Well, I'm sorry you had a bad nap, but I've got a real problem. I have to come up with a good news story by Friday. This could be my chance to be on local tv. Ugh! You want a good story, you should do a report. On whatever this mystery meat is. Wait a minute. That's not bad. I'll solve the mystery meat mystery. This disgusting slop could be my ticket to the big time. -How's lunch today? -Oh, really good, thanks. Hey, honey. -You get some shoes? -Did I get some shoes? Did I get some shoes? I don't know. You tell me. Ba-bam. Wow! Nice! -Yeah, and only $400. -What?! Relax, I'm going to return them the day after the dinner. I'm just borrowing them. They're like a library book that makes my calves look hot. Honey, no store is going to take back shoes once you've worn them. They're not going to know that I've worn them. I'm putting tape on the soles so they don't scuff. Where did you learn this stuff? It's an old trick from my starving student days. I thought I'd outgrow it when I was married, But four kids later and here we are ba-bam! I don't know. Sounds wrong to me. -Or we can just pay the $400. -I'll get the tape. So you cut a kid's hair in kindergarten. And now you're all freaked out? It was the worst thing I ever did. I don't know, maybe I should just apologize. Apologize? I'd cut his hair again, show him who's boss. Okay, guys, what do we think, huh? Huh? Ready for the country club? I don't know, dad. Button the jacket. That's not going to happen. So I'm guessing the top button of your pants. Is out of the question too? Yes, sir, it is. Bob, a little help, please? -Need a little help, please? -What? Whoa, what's wrong? Turns out that putting tape on your shoes makes them. Just a little bit slippery. Well, why don't you change shoes? What, and kill the glamour? How'd you like to pay all that money. To join the country club and see that coming in? What is the meat in mystery meat? To find out, I decided to sit down with Lydia the lunch lady. And ask her some tough questions. -Pretty good so far, huh? -Shh! Ow. So, Lydia, let's get right to it. Tell me about the meat. Does that camera have to be so close? Why are you sweating? Because you're shining a very bright light in my face! Or is it because you're lying? What is it, Lydia? What is the meat? -Ground beef. -Is it? Or is it something else? Mystery meat is it really such a mystery? This is Teddy Duncan and I'm on your side. -So, what do you think? -I can't submit this. -Why not? -Because there are no facts, no proof. I'm sorry, but it stinks. But I need that internship. I want to be on tv. Then you'd better come up with something great by tomorrow. -Oh well, just watch me. -I don't think you can do it. -I'm going to make you eat those words. -Do you want to kiss me. -As much as I want to kiss you? -No, I don't. Worth a shot. -Aw, that movie was awesome! -So awesome! When the blood shot out of that guy's arm, -It looked so real! -So real! What are you guys talking about? -Uh, nothing. -We just saw decapitation 3. -No, we didn't. -Yes, we did. Remember I almost barfed when they used. That lady's head as a bowling ball? Wait wait wait. That movie's rated pg-13. Who took you guys to go see it? His mom. His dad. We slipped the guy at the box office. Five extra bucks and he let us in. What is wrong with you? She's a direct pipeline to the man. And by the man I mean my mom. Okay, so that sleazeball at the movie theater. Is taking bribes from kids? That's Fantastic! -It is? -Yes yes. This is exactly the kind of story I need. This is going to put me on tv, where I belong. You sound like mom. Shut up. Ugh, nice job. -We're probably going to get in trouble now. -I'm sorry. Hey, you want some melted pocket chocolate? That's disgusting. Yeah, okay. -Emergency! Bob, we have an emergency. -What? What is it? -The shoes are gone. -Nobody move! This house is on lockdown! What wh-when was the last time you saw them? Um, uh, when I got home last night, I put them in the box and went to bed. Then I got out of bed to go to the bathroom, put them back on, Went to the bathroom, put them back in the box and went to bed. Wait, why would you put on shoes to go to the bathroom? Because they make everything an event. Honey, look, the only event right now is that we're out $400. We've got to find the shoes! -Hey, guys. -Hey. Hi. Why is Charlie so dirty? We were playing Chase in the yard. And because she was wearing high heels, she slipped and fell. -What heels? -These. -No! -Yeah. Yeah, she looked pretty cute in them too. I got some great pics on my phone. You guys want to see? See? It's funny, not sad. Hey, Dustin, how's it going? I'm P. J. I don't know if you remember me. -We went to kindergarten together. -We did? Yeah yeah, I was the kid who glued his face to the desk. I was the kid who got his tongue caught in the hamster wheel. I was the kid who cut off your ponytail. Oh yeah, I remember that. Yeah yeah. Listen, I know it's probably way too late for this, But I just I want to say I'm really sorry. Eh, don't worry about it. It was a long time ago. -So you're not mad? -Not at all. Oh, that's so great, man. You mind if I stay? -Sure sure. -Cool. You're not going to cut my hair again, are you? Okay okay, you guys, come on. So here's the plan: Gabe, you'll buy the tickets. Jake, you'll wear this hat. It has a camera in it and it'll record the whole thing. I don't look good in hats. Jake, come on, we got to do this. Dude, my hair is my best feature. Okay, well, if you guys don't go through with this, I'll tell both your moms about decapitation 3 And 1 and 2. -Uh, you know about those? -I do now. Can I at least wear it backwards? It's more hip hop that way. What he lacks in brains he makes up for in He's got a pool. Sponge. Marker. Pretzel. -Are they going to make it? -Shh. A very critical part of the operation. I need absolute quiet. -Hey, guys! How's it going? -Ooh! My gosh! Did we lose her? -What is it, P. J. ? -This is Dustin. Is it okay if he sleeps over? -Sure. Hi. Fine. -Cool, thanks. -What are they doing? -I don't know. Playing catch with shoes. Go go. Two tickets for decapitation 3, please. Ooh, that's pg-13, guys. And since I don't see any adults around here, If you want to buy a ticket, There's going to be a handling fee. Hey, maybe we should see fishy friendz instead. No no no no. Look at Gabe! Look at Gabe! Oh! It features the voice talents Of Steve Carell and Rosie Perez. Enjoy the show. -Okay, are we done now? -No no, you didn't get it. Jake was looking at the poster for fishy friendz. I couldn't help it. The fish was wearing glasses. That's hilarious! All right, we're doing this again. This time I'm wearing the hat. Here. Jake, you wait here. -One ticket for decapitation 3.  -Weren't you just here? Yeah, I was here and you were there. And I gave you some money. Now do you want to do it again or not? Okay, you know the drill. Handling fee. Excuse me, did you just sell an 11-year-old boy. A ticket to a pg-13 movie? What? I I don't know what you're talking about. Oh yeah? Okay. Well, I think you do. Because I just caught the whole thing on my hat Cam. Care to make a statement? Yeah. How about how about I give you. Two free tickets to fishy friendz And we make this thing go away, huh? Do it! Busted! This is Teddy Duncan, teen reporter. Remember, when there's news to be reported, then The one reporting it will be me. I'll fix that later. -Good morning. -Hey. Why are you holding the mirror? Because now we're even. Ahh! Ah! Dude, I just had the weirdest dream. Really? What about? It was actually kind of crazy. To get back at me you shaved half my head. Wow.

I got the looks, but he got the crazy. Wait, but I want that internship. -He's my ride to school. -That's not fair. -Life isn't fair. -You can't do this. -Kiss me. -No, thank you. Well, Charlie, looks like my reporting career. Has hit a little bump in the road. Oh, my feet are killing me. Mom, why did you wear your heels to work? Oh, they make everything an event. Oh. The store wouldn't take them back, huh? Laughed in my face. See, this is a good lesson, Charlie. If you try to pull a scam, You're going to suffer the consequences. Here here, give me that camera.

Well, through the rinse cycle anyway. Oh, now come on, come on. You'll make more video diaries and it'll all be okay. -No, forget it. I'm not making any more. -Why not?. If Charlie can't watch them from the beginning, then what's the point? No no no, you were giving her such great advice about how to deal with life and relationships and her family. She's gonna need that. Honey, I'm only gonna get crazier. No, she's just gonna have to figure it out for herself. I'm done with the video diaries. It's such a shame. She worked so hard on those. And I was in so many of them. See, Johnny? The clown doll isn't alive. Okay, dad. But check the closet one more time. Sure, sport. See? There's nothing to Arghh-hh! It's okay, cocoa.

Oh, by the way, I quit school today. -You what? -And I'm running away with my boyfriend. You're running away with Snake? As soon as he gets out of jail. I don't get it, Charlie. You look so much like Teddy, but you're so different. Oh, Teddy Teddy Teddy. I'm so sick of hearing about that clump nugget. Hey hey hey hey. Do not talk that way about the governor of Colorado. Why should I care about Teddy? What's she ever done for me? That sounds like Teddy now. I'm out of here. Hi mom. Hi dad. So how are you guys? Well, not so good. Charlie's out of control again. I knew this would happen. If only I hadn't given up on those video diaries. Honey, you can't blame yourself. No, it's true. It's all my fault. It's all my fault. It's all my fault. It's all my fault. It's all my fault. No, I can't do that to Charlie. Governor of Colorado Not bad. -All right, dude, are you ready? -Yeah, sauce me. Man, that's good hot sauce. Dude, my mouth's on fire.

What did you get me up in the middle of the night for? Mom, I had a terrible dream. It was 15 years into the future and you and dad were there. How did I look? Really good. I'm listening. So Charlie had pink hair and this boyfriend named Snake. Okay okay okay, hold on. How good did I look? Fabulous. Anyway, I know how we can save the video diaries. We're gonna recreate them. Tonight? Yes. I'm not gonna be able to sleep until we get them all done. Come on, let's get going. Hi Charlie. It's your big sister Teddy here. And I'm making this video diary to help you survive our special family. Okay, perfect. One down, 49 to go. Honey, you didn't say good luck, Charlie. Grr! So then Gabe's friend Jake said to mom, you can't do the hoops. You're too old. So mom said In your face, Jake! Make sure to have your playdates at your friend's house. Good luck, Charlie. And if you ever drop your binky in a vase, wish me good luck, Charlie. That one seems kind of lame. Yeah, well, it happened. Well, Charlie, your first trip to the pet store didn't go so well. When we weren't looking, you put a little something in mom's purse a bunny. Okay, wait, stop. This isn't working. That's so obviously Mrs. Dabney's cat with bunny ears. It's 2:00 in the morning. You want me to run the all-night bunny store? I really don't appreciate your attitude. Hey, don't snap at me. I'm the one who jumped the fence and nabbed the cat. All right, forget it. Let's just get him back before Mrs. Dabney notices. Get the lights. Get the lights. It's just a movie. It's just a movie. Oh! Oh! Charlie, go back to bed. And take that evil clown doll with you. Charlie, did you hear that? There it is again. Charlie, wake up. Hey hey hey, what's the matter? They got Charlie! She's been sucked into the portal! -What? -She's in the closet of doom! No, dad, they'll get you too. Don't. Oh. All right, my little monster. You know what? I think I'm gonna put you back in your own bed. What? You can't leave me in here alone. Would you rather sleep at Bob and Amy's place? Could I? All right. Are you coming? My two little babies. And time. Pencils down. Pass your papers forward. Kwikki chikki, kwikki chikki. I will now grade your final examinations. Done. You've all passed. Yes! Quiet. It's not that big an accomplishment. All right, graduation ceremony. Ha ha. It is now my honor to present our commencement speaker, the manager of franchise #268, Fred. It's hard to believe that 20 years ago I sat right where you are now. I too was a High School student about to enter the exciting world of kwikki chikki assistant management. Wow. This career has provided me with so many things, like a room over my parents' garage and the use of the car three days a week. Do I regret not having a wife or kids or even a pet? Not for a moment. And neither will you, after you go to work for kwikki chikki and stay there forever and ever. No! No. There goes P. J. Duncan. He was stupid. He was lazy.

Hey hey, give me the picture of the log ride again. -Ah, look at your face. -Look at your face. Look at the limo driver's face.

I quit my job today. What? You can get it back, right? Uh What? What? We won? I can't believe it. I'll tell you what I can't believe, Duncan It's that you're taking another personal call.

A long time ago. I mean, this is really overdue. -Oh! Oh! -Yeah yeah. Yeah yeah. Hi. Take me to easy street. So long, suckers. How could you do that? Because I was a millionaire. Rich people play by different rules. I'm so sorry. Dad, are you okay? He's hugging the kettle corn. This is all I have left. Oh, the old orange peel smile always cracks me up.

Then he just kind of disappears. Hey, mom, what are you doing? Hey. A couple things. Trying to find a new job. And researching military schools for Gabe. Wow, that sounds stressful. Hey, you know, you should go to the gym, Maybe maybe with a workout buddy, Somebody like Debbie Dooley. She's fun. Teddy, I know what you're trying to do. Mm-hmm, you want back into Debbie Dooley's house, And I know why. -You do? -Yep. You want another babysitting gig. Am I that transparent? Charlie, what happened to your monkey?

Look, the reason my mom quit was all my fault. I played a really mean prank on my parents. And it got way out of hand. Now that you know the truth, can you please give her her job back? Oh, well, If it means that much to you, No! Ha! I gotcha! Oh, you should see your face. I really had you going there, didn't I? Oh good. Good for you, Karen. Okay. Excuse me, Do you know whose lottery ticket this is? Yes. It's mine. I won! I won! I won, I won, I won, I won! Hey hey hey! I've always loved you. Hi. May I? Oh. How much longer are you gonna follow me around? Till I find out the kind of guy you are. Now I'm a guy who's about to restock the cups. bad with cups. Look, I only messed up cause you made me nervous. Thanks. -Got all I need. -For what? To tell Skyler you're not the guy. See ya. No no. Stop. I am the guy. Skyler is the best thing that's ever happened to me. And I'm not going away, no matter what. So put that in your little notebook. Oh, and number 12, your order's ready. Number 12. Uh-oh. Is this the part where you make me disappear? Relax, kid. You stuck up for yourself. That's what I wanted to hear. So it's okay if I date your daughter? Oh, she's not my daughter. She's his daughter.

To watch deedee have fun with Teddy. -What do you mean, watch? -Oh, well, My husband insisted we put in a nanny-cam. Oh, a nanny-cam? I've never seen one of those.

Well, that's a little peculiar. This doesn't seem right. Oh my goodness, she's murdering the monkey. -Oh. -Oh. Really? One neighbor I just want to be friends with one neighbor. Hey, Charlie. So I learned a very important life lesson today, And that is never wear. A pair of accidentally make-a-monkey, Because if you do,your neighbor might said something like oh my goodness, That girl's just not right in the head. Hi, Charlie. Oh, and mom's back at work. Actually her boss quit for some unknown reason, And so she got a promotion. Which is why daddy gets one of these too. Bob, watch where you are going. Ahh! Oh. Yeah, in a couple of years, When all of us kids have left the house, They'll be all yours. Good luck, Charlie. Hey, what happened to you? Isn't it obvious? My head's on backwards.

You will not believe the conversation I just overheard between Gabe and his friend Jake. So you were snooping. I wasn't snooping. I was tiptoeing down the stairs. When I paused for a break. Aha, go on, snoopy. Okay, so anyway, Gabe says, Heather is so hot. And Jake's all, so hot! And then Gabe says, I really like her, But I'm too nervous to talk to her. And Jake's all, dude, you gotta hike up your skirt. And ask her out. Bob, what are we gonna do about this? How about we make you wear a bell so the kids can hear you coming?

Or I wouldn't be here in Gabe Duncan's house, Which is so much bigger than I thought. Isn't it so funny how some houses. Look so small from the outside, but are big on the inside? And other houses look big on the outside, But are small on the inside? Well, anyway, what was the question again? How are you? Good. Great actually, Because I'm in Gabe Duncan's house!

Hey hey hey hey! Hey, get lost, mimey. This is my territory. Go on, hit the imaginary road. -Get outta here. -Whoa whoa whoa, P. J. !. -What happened to you? -Been in New York a day and a half. The city changes you, man. Okay, you need to come home. No no, Skyler and I belong together. I know how you feel, But look at the size of that cockroach. Skyler is the best thing that's ever happened to me. We're meant to be together. P. J. , you're 17 years old. How can you possibly know that? Well, all I know is I don't wanna be apart from her. You might not be apart forever. -What do you mean? -When it comes to love, there's a very old saying Sweet mama, that's a giant rat! Yeah, I've heard that before, but No no no, that's that's not the saying. The saying is Son, if you love something, set it free. If it comes back to you, then it's yours. But if it doesn't, then it never was. What happened to you? I may have overbronzed just a smidge. I didn't think you'd pull off the whole dumb thing, But it turns out you're a natural. -Teddy? -Oh hi, boss. Hey, why don't you toss me that beach ball, dude? Whoo! Yeah! Why are you orange? See, it's just a healthy glow. Hey, brother, why don't you throw me that football? Oh! -Ow. -Are you okay? Yeah, I'm good. I'm fine. Hey, righteous beach towel, dude. Could I use it to wipe up some blood? Mom, what are we gonna do? We can't hide in the kitchen forever. Why not? We've got food. We've got drink. Mom, you gotta get rid of her. This is really hard. I've never broken up with a girl before. -Fine, I'll do it myself. -Gabe, no. Heather, I gotta tell you something. Yes, Gabe? Mom, something you wanna say? Okay. Heather, the thing is. Um, there was a little mix-up about the who likes who thing. Oh no! Gabe doesn't like me? Only because Jake likes you. Which Jake? How many are there? Four. There's short Jake, skinny Jake, tall Jake This one's stocky with red hair. Hot Jake? Standards for the Jakes are really low. I can't believe Jake likes me. He's the total package The red hair, the freckles, the way he always smells like bananas, Which in case you didn't know, are the only fruits in the world Bye-bye now. Bye-bye. So even though you won't find another guy. Who's as crazy about you as I am I set you free. And even though. You'll never find a girl who's crazier than I am About you You're free too. So I guess this is it? See, this is exactly why I didn't want to say goodbye to you. Hey, let's not say goodbye then. Let's just say. See you later. Hey. It'll be okay, son. Hey, would you watch it? I'm having a conversation here, you jerk! Dad? Wow, this city really does change you. Let's get out of here. Well, Charlie, dad brought P. J. back home.

What's the name of that volcano? Beats me. But did you know that the grand canyon's also a mile deep? Yeah, I didn't, but school's out. So I'm not supposed to be learning anything new. Do you know anything about Hawaii? I know they got some weird food. I had some crazy fish today. It's not sitting too well. Either of you guys know how to fly one of these things? Oh, is that more helicopter humor? Afraid not. I feel like I'm gonna -P. J. , do something. -I am. Wake up, old dude! Wake up! P. J. , what are we going to do?. Words, P. J. ! Words!. Oh. Well, maybe I could fly this thing. These controls kind of look like my video game. Where the heck is the zombie cannon? Please, God, if you let me live through this, I promise I'll do something good. Another way to see the grand canyon is by burro. Wow, you work fast. All right, good, steady. Think you got it now? Can I let go? No no, not quite yet. Okay, so I think we've done enough balance. How about some board control? Oh, surfing surfing surfing. That is why we're here, right?

Well, after the lesson's done, Do you want to get a smoothie? Look at you always one step ahead of me. Okay, you think you're ready to hit the water? I guess. Don't worry, you'll be a natural. Okay. Whoo hoo! This is awesome! Whoa yeah! I told you you'd be a natural. Oh, look, one foot. Oh, look, no feet. Gnarly! Cowabunga! Hey, what are you doing here? This is my private lesson. You know you're dreaming, right? What? Wake up, Teddy! Teddy, wake up. Honey, you okay? What happened? The last thing I remember I was at my surfing lesson. Yeah. Well, uh, that didn't go too well. On your first wave, you shouted, I'm a natural! And then you landed on your head. Oh no. I missed my smoothie date. He was so cute. What happened to you? I was almost smothered by my elevator buddy. Oh yeah, big whoop. We were almost killed in a helicopter crash. Didn't you hear me? I missed my smoothie date. Wow, bad day for the Duncans. It's almost like the whole family's cursed. What are you all looking at me for? Huh? I I don't know anything about a curse. Didn't you mention something about a curse earlier? No no no. No no.

I don't deserve entertainment. Dude, what's the matter with you? I can't get what happened in the helicopter out of my head. I just feel like a coward. Well, normally I'd say that's because you are a coward, But I made this promise to be good, so I won't say that. When the helicopter pilot passed out, I just I froze. I didn't do anything. Except scream like a little girl Is something else I won't say. You know, it almost feels like you are saying those things. Being good is new to me, so there's gonna be some snags. I just feel like a total loser. Well, wait a minute. I made a promise to God to do something good. And if I help you face your fears, that would count, right? And then God and I would be square. -You'd do that for me? -That's what good people do, right? I mean, I'm just guessing here. Hey, elevator buddy. Oh, dear, what happened to you? Swimming jellyfish. Things keep happening. Come on, Charlie, Let's go see the pretty garden Or let's go see the pretty boy. The garden's not going anywhere. -Kai. -Teddy. How are you feeling?

Let's meet someone else, shall we? You guys. Man, it feels good to conquer your fears. P. J. , you didn't conquer anything. You ran from a clown, Walked across slightly warm coals.

Actually, that's a quilt. Ooh, this is a quilt? Fine. If you won't do it for yourself, Or me, do it for Charlie. She looks up to you. She does? Did you see that? Fine. I'll give it one more shot. Turns out there's plumeria in the shampoo. Be honest, is it bad? No no, you look fine, mom. Oh, that's good. Remember, it's not about spending money. It's about spending your vacation in paradise.

I'm kind of glad we weren't able to get together until now. Because this could not be more perfect. I know. It's beautiful. Kai, this is my brother P. J. P. J. , kai. Teddy, what did you do? I had a date on the one spot on the beach. Where idiots fall out of the sky. I'm talking about the timeshare. We now own this room. All I did was sign a piece of paper. Which bought us a timeshare, Which we can't afford. You are the worst wife I've ever had. Well, I'm sorry. Why don't you make P. J. Your wife?. Because I'm sure he'd do a much better job. People. Quiet! Why are you wearing a mop? Because my hair's coming out in clumps. Wanna see? No no. Mop's good. Mop it up. Hey, kids, there's something that I have to tell you. I know this is gonna sound really crazy, but here goes. We've been cursed. - Cursed? - Yes. By mano, a grumpy hawaiian man. Who does not like it when you do the robot on sacred ground. A curse? Come on. Think about it. Everything bad Started happening after I got us cursed. - Like the helicopter. - And mom's fatness. - Me getting knocked out. - And mom's baldness. - The timeshare. - And mom's grotesqueness. Okay, got it. Wait a second. Back up. What's this about a timeshare?. Go on and tell her, bobby-boo. - She bought it, not me. - You bought a timeshare? Okay, the only reason we were at that stupid thing. Was so dad wouldn't have to pay for the room. Whoa, but let's not forget about the curse. Okay, you not telling me about a timeshare has nothing to do with a curse. Or does it? So that's it. We're cursed forever? No, we are not. I got us into this mess, and now I'm gonna get us out of it. I'm gonna find mano and have him reverse the curse. What? I'll tell mano to reverse the curse. Looks like you're going to the doctor again. Plumeria tea. Oh, nuts. Hey, excuse me. Are you mano? I am mano. Yeah, listen, you put this curse on my family. And I was just wondering if you could reverse it. Curse. - There is no curse. - There isn't? I just say that to keep the guests out of the plants. I'm the gardener. But what about all the bad stuff that's happened to us? Just got lucky I guess. My family thinks the curse is real. Tell them it's not. I could do that. Or we could have a little fun. You say that with an evil look in your eye. That gives me pleasure. The curse removal ceremony now begins. We are so lucky he does this. You have no idea. First, the family except for the youngest male, Must circle the mother hopping. And chanting Big and gross. Big and gross. She's the one that's cursed the most. What should I do? That's the best part. You do the robot. I do a good robot. Big and gross, big and gross She's the one that's cursed the most Big and gross, big and gross She's the one that's cursed the most Looking good, guys. Making memories here. She's the one that's cursed the most How come Gabe doesn't have to do this? I don't know. Seems awfully chummy with that mano guy. Guys, I think they're just messing with us. Mr. Duncan, there you are. We had a little accident with your timeshare contract. and tiki torch. So if you don't mind, we need to get your wife's signature again. It's working. Keep going! Big and gross, big and gross She's the one that's cursed the most. All right, all right, all right. I wanna make a toast. I wanna make a toast. To the love of my life, My very beautiful wife Amy.

Why do we always have to go fishing? Why can't dad go with one of his friends? Wait a minute. You just said something really interesting. I did? Oh shoot. Now I wish I had been listening. If we can get dad to take some of his friends fishing, then we don't have to go. You're right. Okay, who are dad's friends? He doesn't have any. -Are you sure? -Think about it. Have youver answered the door and said, dad, your friends are here? So all we gotta do is find dad a friend. You mean like fix him up? That's right. We gotta get dad a dude. Well I guess this is goodbye. Mr. Wentz, would you like a moment alone? He slept in the back seat last night. I just wanna make sure that you really wanna do this. So you really wanna sell your car? -Well -He's selling the car! Teddy, before you go, would you take a picture of me and my special girl? Sure. I meant Gracie. Of course you did. Hey, honey, how'd Charlie's first day of school go? Awful. Oh no, what happened? She make a scene? No, she didn't. She just walked through the door without a care in the world. What was the awful part? I just told you. But I know what the problem is. Mm-hmm. Charlie is the fourth child. So I didn't get to spend enough time with her. We did not get enough bonding. Okay, so with more bonding, then she'll cry when you drop her off at school, and that's a good thing? Yes. Okay, try and stay with me, Bob. You seem a little slow today. Hey guys, I think Teddy just pulled up in her new car. -Let's go check it out. -Yeah. Is it noticeable? Oh, honey. Are you okay? -Yeah, no, I'm fine. -Well, what happened? I was driving home and in the middle of the road there was this squirrel. So you swerved to avoid it and you hit something? No, I stopped and I honked. So then someone hit you? This is my accident. Let me tell it. Anyway, I got out of my car and I tried to Chase it off, but it was stuck to this huge wad of gum. What flavor? Who cares? By the way, to get back to the earlier conversation, P. J. Had the most bonding time. Anyway, while I was staring at the squirrel, a garbage truck was backing out of an alley and it smashed right into the car. Do you think it can be fixed? Honey, I'm afraid it's gonna cost more to fix than the car is worth. This is awful. What's Mr. Wentz gonna say when he finds out? Baby! I bet he says baby. Hey! It's my friend Jimmy's dad here to pick up my friend Jimmy. Come in, say hi to my dad. -Hi, I'm Mark. -Bob. I knew you guys would hit it off. So you're Jimmy's dad? Yeah. And your Gabe's. What don't you guys have in common? So where is Jimmy? Dad, please, we're focusing on Jimmy's dad. Who is also wondering where Jimmy is. Guys, enough with the Jimmy. There are other things to talk about besides Jimmy, like fishing, which I know you both love. Not me. I can't do anything outdoorsy. -Allergies. -Oh. Sure wish Jimmy would mentioned that in the pre-interview. Hey oh, sorry. Dad, I didn't realize you had company. Bring your guy in. My guy's not working out. I just remembered Jimmy left about an hour ago. Bye-bye. Dad, there's somebody I am dying for you to meet. This is what's your name again? -Roger. -Right.

The guy comes into a chicken place and orders fish. He loves fish. You love to fish. Roger, Bob, perfect together. Actually, I ordered the fish for my wife. I hate fish. Tease.

Does anyone else have any memories they would like to share of Gracie? Ivy. Come on, sweetie. You got it. My first memory of Gracie was when I was five years old. We were in the garage and dad said, don't touch the car. That's right. He did. Then when I was seven, dad was washing her and he said to me, don't touch the car. -Then when I was around nine -Oh oh oh, I-I think what Ivy is trying to say is that even though she never touched the car, right? The car touched her. No, I'm saying I wasn't allowed to touch the car. Okay, Ivy, I think you're done. Now Mary Lou Wentz would like to dedicate a song to the memory of the dear departed Gracie.

Starts with a t. Just like touchy. Ivy, why are people calling me gigi? I don't know. Maybe it's a nickname. Are they saying gigi like the name gigi Or the letters G. G. ?. I don't know. Probably the second one. What would G. G. stand for?. Glamorous gal. Golden goddess. Genetic greatness. Goody-goody. It means goody-goody. Goody-goody why would they call me that? Maybe it's because you always play by the rules. And never do anything bad. Or something like that. Okay, but I am so not a goody-goody. If anything, I am a baddy-baddy. T, only a goody-goody. Would say baddy-baddy. I've been bad. I've broken rules. -Like when? -Like the time -Okay, I've bent rules. -Like when? Like the time Oh, man. I am a G. G. I'm glad you came around, girl.

Now I'll help you be bad, But you gotta help me with something. -What? -Well, I'm grounded, But I need to get ungrounded by Saturday. Jake invited me to super adventure land. Super adventure land reopened? Yeah, that's why I got there before they close down again. Now how do I get mom and dad to let me go? Well, you could try behaving better. All right, I don't have time for joke. I need answers. Why don't you just do something nice for them? -Like? -I was in the garage last week. And I found this old poem the dad wrote to mom Back In High School. I was gonna give it to her for her birthday, But you could do it now. Then they'll be putty in my hands. -Thanks, G. G. -Stop calling me that. -Hi, Charlie. -Hi, G. G. Argh! Mom, will you make me a dress? P. J. , do we need to talk?. About what? About why you want me to make you a dress. I don't want you to. I need you to. Honey, can't you just borrow one of mine? This could just be a phase. The dress isn't for me. It's for Charlie. I got an assignment in my home ec class to make an outfit. For someone in my family. Okay, next time lead with that. So will you do it? Nope, if I do it, how will you learn? Mom, I took this class to meet girls, Not to learn stuff. It's my third year taking home ec, And I still don't know what ec means. Sorry, kiddo. You're on your own. Fine. Well, then will you help me with my civil war report? Nope. Will you at least tell me who won? I've got a daring new plan. That's gonna blow away my goody-goody image forever. Are you ready for this? Tomorrow, -I say we ditch school. -Okay. Ivy, I don't think you understand what I'm proposing here. I'm saying tomorrow. We're not going to be in school. When school is going on. T, I'm familiar with the concept of ditching. So where are we going? -Super adventure land. -I'm in. Okay, Ivy, it's settled. We are going to ditch school tomorrow. That's right. Tomorrow, Teddy, Ivy ditching. And by ditching, I mean gone.

Now don't worry. I just watched 10 hours of fashion reality shows. So I'm highly qualified. Now let's start by taking a look at what you usually wear. Okay, no. Wrong. Hate it. Girlfriend, what are you thinking? Owls are so last year. Honey, we need to create a whole new look for you, Something that screamingcharlie! Oh, sorry I screamed charlie. If I'm gonna make you the perfect dress, I need to know more about you. So tell me what you like. I like toys. Toys. Fun. Youth. I'm getting something. Wait a second. Yes. Yes!. That's your new look. No. You are such a diva. I love it. Mom, dad, I was feeling so bad. About whatever I did to get grounded. You sprayed Mrs. Dabney with a garden hose. It was an accident. She was in her kitchen. Anyway, I felt so bad about that, That I decided to clean the garage. And I found this in one of mom's little boxes. -And framed it for you. -What is it? It's a love poem dad wrote to mom in High School. No no no. You don't have to read it, Gabe. my dearest Amy, how does a dream leave footprints in the sand? How does a flower kindle a memory. Or candlelight whisper your name? Pretty good so far, huh? Pretty good? I'm a plate of soup. I don't remember writing that. It doesn't even rhyme like a good poem should. Look at that. That's not even my handwriting. Dad, you wrote it. It's signed Bob D. Who else would Bob D. be? Diddlebock. Hey, dad, watch the language. Why would Bob diddlebock. Write you a love poem? Okay, during that brief time. In High School when we were broken up, I dated Bob diddlebock. It was no big deal. Not to Bob diddlebock. You were a dream that left footprints. In his sand. I do have that effect on men. Whoa whoa! So the minute we break up, You go out and find another guy? What was I supposed to do? Go home and cry all day? I did. Bob, it's been 20 years. Let it go. Like you let the poem go? We were on a break. -How about we take another one? -Works for me. Guys, this was supposed. To be a happy moment. For me! Oh! School's just starting. First period is happening right now. Congratulations, t. You're officially ditching. How does it feel to be bad? Great. Does your stomach hurt as much as mine? Howdy, young ladies! I'm the mayor of super adventure land. -Who are you? -I'm Ivy. Uh I'm Claudette. I'm from Oklahoma. My parents aren't here right now. They're taking my brothers Rusty and Dusty to the bathroom. Well, that's a little more information. Than I needed, darling. What is wrong with you, Claudette? I'm new at this, okay? A cop is staring at us. He totally knows we're ditching. T, will you stop? He doesn't care about us. Then why is he coming over here? Just be cool. Nobody's in trouble. Young ladies, you're under arrest. We're under arrest? -Afraid so. -For what? For not having enough fun. And as sheriff of super adventure land, I'm gonna have to give you a ticket. For a free smoothie. Now can we please go have some fun? I wanna ride terror in the sky. Really? 'cause I was thinking Mr. Chipmunk's kooky clown cars. Yeah, I'm gonna go find Rusty and Dusty. Dad, check out this old photo album I found in the garage. You stay out of the garage. It's full of misery. Let's look at all the great times you and mom have had. Hey, there's you and mom and some handsome guy at the prom. That's Bob diddlebock. Moving on. Hey, where'd mom get that really cool sports car? That's Bob diddlebock's. He had two. All right, let's try one more. Any chance you had a boat. Called the s. S. Diddlebock?. You know, I just can't believe she kept his poem all these years. Anyway, thanks for cheering me up, Gabe. Handsome, smart and rich. Oh, Amy, how did you let him get away? Hey, mom. You know what would be a really cool thing to do before Saturday? -What's that? -Rip up Bob diddlebock's poem in front of dad. Show him it means nothing to you. Gabe, I'm not gonna do that. Why? Because you still have feelings for him? So now you're lurking in the kitchen? Hey, I am always in the kitchen. I just happened to be lurking this one time. You just answer the question. No, I do not have feelings for Bob diddlebock. Then why did you keep his stupid poem all these years? Because it's the only love poem anyone ever wrote me. That's why. Oh, yeah? Well, that's that's That's a pretty good reason. Man, now I just feel bad. You know, the best way to get over feeling bad is. To make someone else feel good. I can be that someone. No? Okay. So where should we go next? Say cheese! Have a super day! Ivy! -Did you see that? -See what? Who wants to take a picture with me? Step right up. Hey, I saw what you did! You stole that woman's wallet. I don't know what you're talking about. Toodle-oo! Hey, come back here. What in tarnation is going on here? The mayor, he's a thief. He stole a woman's wallet. -What? -Careful, Bill. She's been acting up all day. Might be a code 6. -Let's go. -Wait a minute. What's a code 6? Possible wacko! Why isn't Charlie in preschool? I had to pull her out. We have work to do. Why aren't you in school? Charlie's dress isn't done, and I'm on a deadline. Okay, are any of my kids in school? At least I know Teddy is. Mom, I'm freaking out. Would you mind taking a look at my dress? Sure, let's see what you got. It's all Charlie's fault. She's not selling it. Don't blame the model. I said be fierce. Is that fierce? I don't know. No, you don't, do you? This this is a disaster. Ivy, you gotta get me out of here. I am not cut out for the slammer. Don't worry. I've got this. Okay. Howdy, sheriff. Whoops. Sheriff, I think you dropped 200 fun bucks there. Are you trying to bribe me? Maybe I am. With pink money that has absolutely no monetary value? Sheriff. I'm on my way. Well, it's your lucky day. We're understaffed. We just got a code 12. What's that? Some kid just barfed on the tilt-a-whirl. Now you're free to go. Thank goodness. P. J. , we're waiting. All right. Say hello. To Charlie. Her kicky summer dress is perfect for the 2 year old. Who plays all day and parties all night. From nap time to snack time, This dress says it all. And if there's an oopsie with a juice box, No problem. It's washable. I have to say I am impressed. Clean lines, nice stitching. Excellent job. Thank you and thank you, Charlie. Yeah. Is that a price tag? All right, b minus. Really? Oh, because buying the dress. Is a creative way to solve the problem? No, because this is your third time in my class. We're done. Hello! Can I borrow someone's notes? Sorry, I don't know if you guys noticed. I wasn't here yesterday. That's right. Ditching. Yeah, you told us that. We went to super adventure land, Had a bit of a run-in with the cops, Ended up in jail. T, look. -What is he doing here? -Teddy Duncan, would you come up here, please? Hello, I am the sheriff of super adventure land. And because of this young lady, We uncovered a ring of pickpockets. That sadly included our own mayor, The town crier. And yes, sal the squirrel. And now on behalf of super adventure land, And our parent company, famfunco industries, north America, I'm proud to present this super citizen medal. To Teddy Duncan. I'm not a super citizen. I'm a ditcher. I'm bad. Well, whatever you are, Thank you for saving good wholesome clean family fun. G. G. ! G. G. !. Guys, I'm bad! I'm bad I tell you! G. G. ! G. G. !. What the heck? G. G. ! G. G. !. Hey, Amy, you got a minute? -What is it, Bob? -Something I want you to hear. Okay, I wrote this for you. To my wonderful wife, The love of my life, Here is a poem from your bobby-boo. I love your sweet hugs. Even more than my bugs. And your kisses more than chili or stew. You do love your stew. Okay, here, there's more. There's more. Okay. and though our future's unwritten, I still remain smitten. And will till the end of all time. This poem may be late. I know it's not great, But at least I know how to rhyme. That's very sweet. Thank you, bobby-boo. Eww. I mean, what's going on? I have a new poem for my frame. Yes, and it rhymes. You guys made up. That's just fantastic. You know, we should celebrate. How about a trip to super adventure land? Yeah, why not? We haven't been there in a while. -Yeah, sounds good to me. -Yes! Hey, P. J. , guess what. The whole family's going to super adventure land. Oh, didn't you hear? There's a big scandal involving the mayor. Super adventure land's closed. No! Well, Charlie, mom and dad found out I ditched. And now I'm grounded. It's called consequences. Something you get used to when you're a baddy-baddy. Darn, I'm still wearing the medal. Teddy, what are you doing? No video diary while you're grounded. No video diary while I'm grounded? That seems kind of lame. I don't know how else to punish you. You don't really do anything. So you don't think I'm bad? Mom, I'm bad. I'm so bad I'm not even gonna say good luck, Charlie. -You just did. -Oh! The story you have just seen it's true. The outcomes are completely made up. The mayor was found guilty of lying, stealing And talking in a ridiculous cartoony voice. Ridiculous?! I think not. Gabe Duncan eventually made it to super adventure land. He was thrown in jail three minutes later For spitting off the monorail. PJ Duncan did not go on a career in fashion design. Amy Duncan Just likes having a picture-taken.
Looking forward to it. Okay, see you then, buddy. Clump nugget! -Who's a clump nugget? -Mike Gogan. Uh-oh, must be time for bowling with the Gogans. Don't you mean losing to the gogans? Hey, come on, let's have a positive attitude. I mean, sure we've lost to them five years in a row, And sure we've never come within 50 pins. Sure. Dad gives the worst pep talks in history. Hey, that's not the way winners talk. Mom, if I knew how winners talked my name would be Teddy Gogan. Well now, I don't know if I ever told you kids this, But I was the star of the southwest Denver. Women's bowling team. You were? Oh, gee, I'd love to hear about that. Seems like you were on every club and team at that school. How did you have time for classes? I'm not even sure that school had classes. To me, it was more of an activity center. Dad, I'm sorry to say this, But I think I'm too busy for bowling this year. Oh, man. I was thinking Gabe could replace me. Okay, I guess we'll just muddle through, But believe me. You're gonna be missed. Thanks for understanding. Thanks, guys. Yes! We finally have a chance to win! Yeah! Why are your arms in the air? We're Stretching. Why are you stretching? Because we're happy you're not bowling this year. Today's all burnt toast  Running late, and dad jokes Has anybody seen my left shoe I close my eyes, take a bite Grab a ride, laugh out loud There it is up on the roof I've been there, I've survived So just take my advice Hang in there, baby Things are crazy But I know your future's bright Hang in there, baby There's no maybe Everything turns out all right Your life is up and down But trust me it comes back around You're gonna love who you turn out to be Hang in there, baby. -You ready, Ivy? -Ready.

And the winner also gets to sing the national anthem. At a Denver nuggets game. And then win a car. Well, good luck. I sure do love that song. Yeah, you know, Mrs. Wentz, I'd suggest that you enter the contest, But I wanna win a car. T, my mom's not interested. Who said I'm not interested? You know, when I was younger, It was my dream to become a professional singer. Really? What happened? Oh, I got married, then we had Ivy. So you're blaming me? I killed your dreams?

Dad, I know a kid from school that knows a kid. Whose cousin won a mystery box. And do you wanna know what was in it? An mp3 player. Yeah? Well, I know a kid who has a dad who doesn't care. Let's go. -Hey, mom. -Hey, P. J. , you know what?. You must have hit the wrong key on your buddy page. Because you accidentally declined my buddy request. No, I meant to do that. What? You don't wanna be my buddy? Why not? Mom, I really love you, but it's kind of lame. See, buddy page is for interacting with my friends. And cute girls who would never otherwise talk to me. Okay, it's lame to be buddies with the woman who gave birth to you? Now you're getting it. But, P. J. , if we're buddies,. We can post fun stuff on each other's page. And then I can find out about what's going on in your life. You are so good at explaining why this is a bad idea. Thank you. -Hey, Charlie? -Yeah? If you were on buddy page, you'd be my buddy, wouldn't you? No, mama. Here I come! Mrs. Wentz, that is quite an outfit. Wait till you see the hat. The batteries are still charging. How's my face?

All looking at me? -Are you okay, mom? -I did not think this through. Why are you putting down your purse? Because I'm staying here where there is no jumbotron. -You're not going? -No, I am not. No, okay, it's totally normal to be a little bit nervous. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna drive to the arena. You're gonna sing the song. I'm gonna win a car. Everyone's gonna be happy. Whoa! No. -That was the sound of a lock, wasn't it? -Yes, it was. -She is not coming out, is she? -No, she's not. -Blip? -Blip. Mrs. Wentz, you wanna come out now? No, thank you. If you don't come out, your dream won't come true. The dream where you get a car? Yeah, yeah, that's the one. Ivy, say something. Can't blame this one on me and dad, can you? Okay, Mrs. Wentz, You made a commitment. To show up and sing the national anthem. Now you are refusing. To honor that commitment. To our nation, the United States of America. Now is that what you wanna do? Let down the entire country? Okay. Hey, mom, how you doing? To be honest, I'm kind of upset. Great great. Wanna hand me that remote? P. J. Rejected me as a buddy on buddy page. Makes me think he's hiding something. He's a teenager. Of course he's hiding something. Not like us preteens. We're an open book. I wish there was some way I could view his buddy page. There is. I could confirm you as a buddy. And since I'm P. J. 's buddy,. You'd be able to look at his page and he'll never know. You would do that for me? Sure, I'll just delete some things, confirm you, And you're all set. It is so nice having a child. Who will help me spy on my other children. I can't take all the credit. I had to get my evil genes from someone. Mary Lou wentz, I am done fooling around. Now I want you to unlock that door. And get your butt in the car now! Teddy, that's funny. Do it again. It was pretty good. You know what? I give up. I'm sorry, Teddy. I just can't sing in front of all those people. Wait, what if you didn't have to sing. -In front of all those people? -I'm listening.

Ok people, P. J. 's birthday is this Saturday. And everyone needs to buy him a present. And by everyone, I mean Gabe. And by buy him a present, she means actually purchase one. Not borrow or steal it. Why are you guys peeking on me. I always get P. J. a present. Last year, you wrapped up one of his shirts and gave it to him. And he loved it. I can't believe my baby boy is turning 18. Hey guys, what're you talking about? Nothing! What are you whistling about? Not my birthday. That's for sure. Hey P. J. , how would you like a pair of pants exactly like those?. Oh man! Teddy. Are you ok? I'm just bummed out that I have to kiss Spencer. Your ex-boyfriend Spencer? The one who cheated on you? No, dad, the other Spencer in my life. Well, why would you want to kiss that guy? Because I need a car. Tell him more. He's lost. Ok, I've got a new job at Super Adventure Land. I have to play the princess, princess has to kiss to frog and the frog is Spencer. Teddy honey, I feel for you. I know how uncomfortable it is to kiss your ex. I remember this one time in college Today's all burnt toast  Running late, and dad jokes Has anybody seen my left shoe I close my eyes, take a bite Grab a ride, laugh out loud There it is up on the roof I've been there, I've survived So just take my advice Hang in there, baby Things are crazy But I know your future's bright Hang in there, baby There's no maybe Everything turns out all right Sure life is up and down But trust me it comes back around You're gonna love who you turn out to be Hang in there, baby. Charlie. Did you do something with daddy's can. No daddy. Well did you see where it went? It's a secret. Well, do you want to tell daddy the secret? Gabe. That's why you are my favorite. Gabe. Did you just steal my can. Can? I don't know anything about the can. Step away from the cabin. No, no, dad. -Come on.  -Dad, I really don't think you want to do that. What's going on? I'm recycling. -No kid. -Yeah. I'm I'm concerned about the environment. I'm gonna be on this planet for a really long time. Now you, you've got nothing to worry about. So, all this sudden interest in recycling has nothing to do with the fact that maybe you think you can make a little money off it. Ahh, is that right? I did not know that. Well, here's something else you don't seem to know, In the state of Colorado, they don't give you money for aluminum cans. Oh, yeah, I knew that. Oh, dad, by the way, can you give me a ride? Sure, where to? Kansas. Hey mom, guess what? I join Spanish club. Is it about taking a school trip or meeting girls. It's about taking a trip with girls or as we say in Spanish: con-girls. Anyway I may need a passport to go to Mexico so I need my birth certificate. -You need your birth certificate. -Yes. You got it, right?. Yeah It's It's in my files. I will take it out for you. -Thanks. -Yeah, no problem. Bob, it finally happened. P. J. wants to see his birth certificate. We knew this day would come. Oh, stop whimpering and man up! Hey! Hey. So, today is the day of the big kiss. Huh? Yeah, it's so. You look great in that outfit. Oh, I know. I mean thanks. Look! Spencer, there is no reason why it has to be awkward. Well It's not you and I kissing. It's just our characters. I mean we're professionals. Right?. You are right. I'm as professional as a guy in frog suit making minimum wage it can be. Well, that's our cue. See you out there. And when their joyous dance came to an end. The prince and the princess seal their love with a kiss. Wait, Teddy. And the prince and the princess walk off together and live happily ever after. Bob, you had 18 years to change P. J. 's birth certificate. Why didn't you? For once, can we not play the blaming game. It's the only game we know. Ok, look. There is a there is a very simple solution. We'll just tell P. J. we can't afford to send him to Mexico. You want me to lie to him? I'm in. Hola padre. Hola madre. Hola Sr. and Sra. Duncan. Hola Emmett. Cómo estás? What's she saying? I have no idea. P. J. , hey. Eh, listen. Look, we've got some bad news about the trip which is heartbreaking considering how well you're doing with the Spanish. Honey. We can't afford to pay for your trip to Mexico. I'm so sorry. Actually, the Spanish club is having fund raised all year. The trip is paid for. Yeah. no cost of a dime, it's a free trip to our neighbour to the north. It's south. Umm, not on the way back. Spencer. Hey, eh. Can we talk? I eh, just want to make sure you are ok. Well I'm not ok. Teddy, I felt terrible about this, alright? You are in the job first and kissing me makes you feel that bad then I'm just going to quit. No, Spencer. It's not that the kiss was bad. It's the kiss was. Good. Ohh. You know. I didn't I didn't want it to be good. In fact, I was all prepared to be disgusted. Thanks. Now I don't know what to do. Teddy Hurting you was the stupidest thing I've did. Could you please give me another chance? Did you notice that every time we kiss balloons appear? It was good to see them too. Come on Charllie, say it. I love you! Isn't that adorable, grandma? Yes, she made me call just so she could tell you that. Hey listen, grandma. While I got you on the horn a thought occured to me. Every year you send me a Christmas check for 50$. And you know what? I'm thinking about it. Won't it be easier for you to send me the next 10 checks for all at once? You know, like a prepay plan. -Gabe!  -Got to go. Ok, out with it. What do you try to get this money for? Alright. The truth is I want the ZCube 6. A new game system? I just got you the ZCube 5 last year. Yeah, last year! It doesn't even have 3D graphics. I might have used it as a food store. Ok, you are gonna have to find another way to make money without shaking down your relatives. Hello. Oh, hey Aunt Diane. Yeah, thanks for calling back. Oh, what did I want? Eh, eh just just say I I love ya. See what you're making me do. Eh, P. J. There is something I need to tell you. Now before I say anything, I just want you to know your mother and I would love you very much. That doesn't sound good. What's going on? P. J. , we've been keeping a secret from you. -What is it?  -It's about your name. As you know, you were named after your great grandfather Patrick John. Yeah, they gave and usually called me Patty John. Yeah, yeah, ok, here is what you don't know. Uhm, when you were born, I filled out the papers and I was really nervous and I-I-I think my hand was shaking a little and here. That is your legal birth certificate. That's what P. J. stands for. I'm afraid so. My name is Potty John. Legally, yes! Potty John. I'm named after two toilets. Legally, yeah! And you never bother to fix this. But we always meant to. I just, we just never got around to it. Kinda like the upstairs potty huh? Too soon? So your dad and I were talking and we felt really bad that you have to go to work every day and kiss that horrible Spencer. Yeah. Horrible is kinda a strong word. Anyway, since the only reason you're doing this is to get money for a car. Well Come with me. Tada! -Ooh. What's this?  -It's your new car. Shut up! One of the other nurses was selling it and I got a great price. Now it's all yours. Aww! I don't know what to say. Thank you thank you Get in. And the best part is now you can quit your job so that you never have to go near that jerk Spencer ever again. Yay. You should give it a name. Oh I know. How about the Now I don't have to kiss Spencer anymore mobile? Or Ed. I kinda like Ed. Come on in guys. Right this way. The fun begins in a minute. -Err, Gabe. -Yep. Who're these kids. I've never seen them before. You've never seen them because these are the kids who never get invited anywhere. Ok, so why are they here. What's in it for you. The satisfaction of bringing joy to a few sad misfits. Excuse me! Yes! Do I give you the twenty dollars now or when the play date is over? -Now is good. -Awesome. Gabe. Did you see the smile on the little scamp's face. Mom, I had the craziest dream last night. Ooh, me too. I was in high school. Only I had wings and all the cheerleaders were really jealous because I kept flying around during our routine. Then out of nowhere, Lady Gaga appeares throwing her shoe at me. Ok mom, can we stay on me. Anyway, in my crazy dream, Spencer and I got back together. And then you guys found out and you took my car away. Oh duh. You know Teddy, my dream is a lot more entertaining than yours. Mom, I have to tell you something. Did you know that this car has a satellite radio? -It does?  -Uh-huh. Over 100 stations. You were saying? Right, right, ok. Here is the thing. I. Is that the mp3 hookup? This baby is fully loaded. Oh men. You are not making this easier. Speaking of making things easier, ba-bam, your very own gas card. Huh. And, so you don't get lost. Ba-bam, your very own GPS. Now what was that you wanted to tell me? Mom, I want to tell you that I'm in love with Ed. Alright, this is from Gabe. A 10-dollar gift card for frozen yogurt. Probably about 6 dollars left on it. I was feeling snacky! Ok, here is mine. It's a journal for your trip to Mexico. Everyday you can write what you did, what you saw, how you felt about it. -Aw, I love it. -Yeah. You'll never get a gift secret for decision? No. Okay. Here is a little something from mom and dad. Oh, wow, guys. This is so generous. Just a little spending money for Mexico. Enjoy your dinaro. Oh, do I have to spend it on dinaro. Can I use it for breakfast-o or lunch-o? Sweetie, when you're down there, stay close to the teacher. There is one more thing we got you. Went down to the court house this morning. Finally got your birth certificate fixed. You are now officially P. J. Duncan. Dad, did you double check this. No! Why, how can anybody possibly mess up P. J. Don't ask me. According to this my name is PP Duncan. Turn out, it's not looking so bad now, is it? Well, looks like that's all the presents. PP, happy birthday!! Oh wait, wait. There's one left. It says it's from Charlie. Charlie! You don't have to give me anything. What? A new guitar! This is just what I wanted. How do you guys know? Did you do that? Awww. It's so cool. Hey Gabe. How are you liking that new ZCube? Oh, I decided not to get it, the ZCube 7's coming out soon. You used that money to buy that new guitar for your bro. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh come on Gabe. If you tell anybody about this I will never forgive you. Why would you want to keep that a secret? Because I can't let people think that I've gone soft or that I love my brother. Alright alright. Your secret is safe with me. I'm proud of you. You're a good kid. See! That's the exact kind of talk I was afraid of. Hey guys. -Hey. -Hi honey. There are the keys dad. I'm giving em back. What? Why? Oh because you're gonna taking him back anyway. Why would we do that? There is a secret that I've been keeping from you guys. Come on in. Hi Mr. and Mrs. Duncan. Spencer and I are dating again. Ok, at first I didn't want to tell you guys because I was afraid that you would take away the car. I figured that I had a choice to make either Ed or Spencer so after thinking about it for a long time. A really long time. I chose Spencer. I decided to give him another chance. So, we're back together now and I'm very happy. Well. I'm just glad that you could be honest with us. And. If you're happy I guess that's all that really matter. Thanks. You're letting me keep the car. We're letting you pay for the car. With the job that you're going to keep. Fair enough. Welcome back to the family Spencer. And if you ever hurt my little girl again Ba-Bam. Hey Charlie, so, big news. This week I got a new old boyfriend named Spencer and an old new car named Ed. And someday if I take good care of him, you could have him. Oh Ed, not Spencer. That would be just weird. Excuse me! Who are you? I'm Eliot. I paid Gabe for another play date for playing hide and seek. But I've been hiding for almost 5 hours. He went to baseball practice. Oh, I'll wait. Well, I guess there's only one thing left to say. Oh hey, you are here why don't you say it? Good luck Charlie. Teddy! Who said that? It's me, your car. Ed, you can talk? I prefer Edward. And yes. Huh, so I have a talking car? Oh does that mean we're going on an adventure and solve crimes and stuff. Well, that sounds kind of dangerous I've thought we'd just drive carefully and stay within speed limit and stuff. Oh man. So I have a talking car who's boring. Oh uh, one other thing I have to tell you. I don't feel so good. Edward, Edward talk to me. Gotcha. Not so boring now, am I?
Hey, dad, you gonna eat your last piece of bacon? Nice. Oh, dad, by the way I'm having career day at my school, And I was wondering if you could come. Really? You want me to come in and talk about my job? - That's fantastic. - Easy, big guy. You're a time filler. Nothing more, nothing less. That's a little less fantastic. Hey, how come I never came in and spoke to one of your classes? We didn't have career day back then. It's a whole new idea. Really? They had career day when I was a kid. Must have skipped a generation. Hey, Gabe. Why aren't you asking me to career day this year? Because of what happened last year. We see a lot of interesting things in the emergency room. This is what can happen when you don't follow the directions. On the chainsaw. Kids, kids, hold your reactions till the end. We've got a lot of pictures here. So now severed limbs are off-limits to 11-year-olds? What? Today's all burnt toast  Running late, and dad jokes Has anybody seen my left shoe I close my eyes, take a bite Grab a ride, laugh out loud There it is up on the roof I've been there, I've survived So just take my advice Hang in there, baby Things are crazy But I know your future's bright Hang in there, baby There's no maybe Everything turns out all right Your life is up and down But trust me it comes back around You're gonna love who you turn out to be Hang in there, baby. 'And cheesy,  the sad little pizza said, 'I just feel so plain.' And pepe, his friend the pepperoni pizza said,{\i0} 'but, cheesy, that's why kids love you.' And cheesy felt all better.{\i0} The end. Mom. Candace, thank you so much for this story, we really enjoyed it. I heard you snoring. The important thing is Charlie liked, right Charlie? No, mommy. She's right. It was not a good book. I could write a better story than that. I wish you would. I working in children's Publishing And I am always on the look out for new talent. Anyway, we'll see you guys next week. - Bye, Candace. - See ya. - That gives me an idea. - Me too. I should write a children's book! What do you know about writing? What do you know about children? Maybe we could write a book together. And then we could read it at next week's story time. And the kids will go crazy. Candace will publish it, And I'll be on good morning Denver. Right now let's just focus on writing a good story for the kids. You're right. You're right. It's all about the kids. Oh, great. I guess dinner's here. And a happy kwikki chikki hello to you. - I heard that, Scott. - I'm sure that you heard, but when I ask. For a home-cooked meal, you suddenly go deaf. I'm not a housewife. I work too. Do you want me to come back later? No, then the food will be cold. Don't worry. It's already cold. Let's ask this guy. What do you think? Come on, we want your opinion. Who is responsible for dinner? That is a tough question. I've seen my parents have the very same argument 'cause they both have jobs too. - How do they work it out? - Very loudly. But at least they're communicating, Which is maybe what you guys need to do. But we are communicating. Are you? Are you really? No, we're not. Maybe it's time to start. I just want things to go back to the way they were when we first got married. I want that too. I'm sorry, honey. I'm sorry too. Well, I guess there's only one thing left to say. That'll be $14. 95. Okay, tell me what you think of this. actress, singer, dancer, comedian, entertainer, nurse, Wife, mother of four, Amy Duncan now adds author. To her long list of credits. What is that? It's my bio for the book jacket. Too long? 'cause I could lose wife and mother of four. Hey, I have an idea. Instead of a book jacket, let's write a book. Okay, seems kind of backwards to me, but okay, sure. Let's just brainstorm and see what we come up with. Excellent idea. Brainstorming. Stormy brain. Thinking, thoughts, ideas, words Mom, brainstorms are usually quiet. Sorry. And remember, an idea can come from anywhere. - Got it! - What? Trashy. Trashy? Trashy the trash can. I was staring at the trash can and it just came to me. Okay, trashy. So what's his story? Teddy, I can't do all the work. I came up with trashy. Yeah, but what's he trying to teach the kids? Oh, okay. Um, well, when trashy. Sees someone litter, He says, enh-enh-enh-enh. I do that really well. I should do hjs voice for the movie. Hey, mom, let's think of some other ideas. Really? 'cause I'm loving me some trashy. Okay okay, well, maybe we should work separately, Then get together tomorrow with some new ideas. That aren't based off of the first thing you looked at. - Fine. - Good. - Whatever. - Great. Enh-enh-enh. I can see it on a t-shirt. Okay, dad, career day is tomorrow. What's your plan? - My plan? - Yeah. To wing it. Dad, this isn't a toast to mom on your anniversary. This is important. Now you can't just get up there and talk aboutour job. You gotta put on a show. This is all about the sizzle, not the steak. I get it. You want me to bring in a couple of critters that I caught, Like a rat or a possum. Is there any chance you could catch something exciting, Like an alligator or a lion. Or a polar bear? Yeah. Well, those might be tough since career day is tomorrow. And we live in Denver. All right, dad, whatever you do, Just don't embarrass me. That means shirt tucked in and your most dependable belt. Hey, that's not gonna happen again. Man, you ruin one little league game Hi again. Ooh, something smells good. - I'm making pork chops. - Then why'd you order chicken? Actually, we were hoping you could help us with another problem. Oh, well, come on out. Have a seat, make yourselves at home. Talk to me. The thing is Christine's mother wants to come and stay with us. For two weeks. I wanted to ask her to come for less time, But But what? Come on, tell the chicken guy. - But I'm afraid of her. There, I said it. - Yeah, but just because. Hold on. We're working with Christine now. Now, Christine, how did that make you feel? Well, it makes me feel sad, and I want Scott - Scott, feedback. - I feel that I'd like to help Christine, - So she wouldn't be so sad.- How can you help? Well but you asked me. Don't question my process. I'll tell you how you can help. Date night. - Date night. - Yeah, make sure you guys schedule some alone time. While your mother's here. Your needs are important too. - Date night. That's a great idea. - Yeah. Thank you so much. Hey, it's what I do. Now let's take a look at those pork chops. Now before we share our book ideas, Let's remember to be kind. That's right. There are no bad ideas. I'll go first. Ba-bam! Hey, trashy's back. I know. Try as I might, I could not top him. Can I share one of my ideas now? Y-yeah, of course. Go ahead. Okay. So my idea is a story. About a little tin can and his name is Tim can. So the story begins with Tim on the shelf at the store. Then he goes on some amazing adventures. That teach kids all about recycling. What do you think? I think I was wrong. There are bad ideas. Honey, don't get too down on yourself. I set the bar pretty high with trashy. Are you kidding? You just you pointed at a trash can. And gave it a stupid name. I could do that. Let's write a story about tabley or blendery. Blendery? Okay, that's just silly. What would a blender say? chop chop chop? Even I can't make that work. You know what doesn't work? This. You know what you are jealous. Yes, I am, Of people that don't have to work with you. Then fine. Don't work with me. I'll write trashy by myself. Okay, well, I'll write tim can by myself, Then next week at story time, we'll let the kids decide which one's best. Oh yeah yeah. They'll decide To feed your book to trashy! When mommy finishes reading her book at story time, I want you to jump up and yell, yay, trashy! - Can you do that for me? - Yay, trashy! Yay! - What are you doing? - Nothing. You're coaching Charlie. Mom, that's cheating. I am her mother. It is my job to tell her what stuff to like. Okay, so trashy's the right stuff? Enh-enh-enh. Even though you're mocking me, It still works. Okay, Charlie, now repeat after me, Tim can, I love Tim can. Yay, trashy! Gahhh! Guys, what are you doing here? - This is my mother Elaine. - We need you. We tried ordering chicken, But they said you weren't working today. Well, I guess I could fit you in. Have a seat. Okay, talk to me. I didn't come halfway across this country. So these two could go out on a date night. Then feel free to go back. Scott, that is my mother. Okay okay, I see what's going on here. You guys are talking at each other, not with each other. Now you talk to me, and I'll talk to him. And he'll talk to me and I'll talk to her. She'll talk to me, and I'll talk to you. That's you to me, me to him, him to me, Me to her, her to me, me to you. It's just that simple. It's kind of hard to take you seriously without the hat. Oh, sorry. Let's get to work. I was just afraid of losing you. You'll never lose me. And you can stay here as long as you like, {\i1}mom.{\i0} What's going on in here? Healing. What's going on in here is healing. Thank you, Mr. Turtlebaum. Oh. Of turtlebaum & turtlebaum accounting: A professional corporation. Right. Now let's give a warm room six welcome. To my dad, Bob Duncan. - Hey. - Dazzle me. Hey, everybody, I am Bob Duncan of Bob's bugs be gone. And I am here today. To talk to you. About the fine art of pest control. Yes. Now in my typical day, I come across all sorts of insects Ants, roaches, mice. wait, Mr. Duncan, you say, mice aren't insects. They are Anybody? That's right. They are rodents. Not here to learn. Anyway, I've brought along some animals. That, although I've never seen them on the job, I could quite possibly catch. If we were living in a different climate. On a different continent. For example {\i1}Look at that guy{\i0} That is an emperor scorpion. Now some people say that its sting is no worse than a bee's, And others, well, they're not around to say anything. Ow! I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. Hey, you thought that was cool, huh? Wait until you check out this guy. Whoa. Look at him, huh? This is a corn snake. Pretty cool, huh? That's my dad. Hello, everybody, welcome to story time. My name is Teddy, and today we have a special treat. You're gonna hear two stories. The first one is written by me, and it's called. Tim can and his amazing journey. Tin can? Tim. {\i0} Tim can. All right, now before we begin, Just a reminder, as of today, This story has not been published. Okay. Once upon a time, there was a little can of soup. And his name was Tim. Tim lived at the grocery store hoping someday someone would buy him. One day a nice woman did. Her name was Candace. Oh! Hey! That's your name. -That's funny. -Okay. Candace took Tim home, Poured his soup in a pot, Then tossed him in the recycling bin. Tim was sad. Is that all there is?  he wondered. That's what I'm wondering. Poor plumber, having to follow me. I guess somebody had to go on after Elvis, right? You did great, dad, and more importantly, - So did your belt. - Yeah. Gabe, your old man wasn't gonna let you down. Have you seen the scorpion? - What? You lost a scorp - Wait wait wait wait. Let's just find it quietly by ourselves. All right. Scorpions aren't poisonous, right? How should I know? I just rented it this morning. I thought I saw something on tv that said a scorpion can paralyze you. That might have been a nice thing to mention. Before I let it walk on me. I think they found it. and after Tim had been recycled into Tim pie plate. And Tim aluminum foil, He went back to being Tim can. And lived happily ever after. The end. Yay! Well, kids, wasn't that better than cheesy and pepe pizza? Yeah! Hey, kids, here comes trashy!{\i0} Hey, everybody, I'm trashy the trash can. But I'm not just any trash can. No, I'm a trash can that gives out candy. Whoo! And the best part about trashy. Is that he has magical powers. So that he never runs out of candy. Yeah, eat it up. Yeah, eat it up. And that's the story of trashy the trash can. The end. That's not a story. You're just throwing candy at the kids so they'll like your book better. Well, let's see if it works. Who likes trashy better than Tim can? - Me! - Ooh ooh ooh! Yeah yeah! Mm-hmm. - Oh, yeah? Well, I forgot to tell you one thing about Tim can. He is gonna take all of you kids in the library. Out for ice cream. Okay, everybody repeat after me. Trashy! Trashy! Trashy! - Tim can! Tim can! Tim can! - Trashy! Trashy! Trashy! Oh, Candace, do you wanna buy my story? Or do you wanna buy story? What I want is to find a new library for story time. Great. What am I supposed to do with 500 of these? And what seems to be the problem tonight? There's no problem. Everything's great. Aren't we past this? Let's dive in. No, seriously, we're fine. We worked out all our issues. Then why'd you order chicken? Because we're hungry. But if you guys are fine, Then I'm just the chicken guy. Pretty much. Thanks. Keep the change. I'll be back! I forgot your sides. Gabe. Can I talk to you for a minute? Kinda busy with my string cheese. Buddy, I'm really sorry about today. All you asked me to do was not embarrass you. And that's exactly what I did. Dad, you didn't embarrass me. Thanks to you, everybody loves me. What? Yeah, after the scorpion stung you, and then you passed out, And then Mr. Turtlebaum tried to suck the poison out of you. And then he passed out. What? In all the confusion, the snake got loose. Yeah, backup. Turtlebaum did what? And then while you were at the hospital, The fire department came and the whole school was evacuated for the day. I am a hero because of you. Thanks, dad. Now I'm gonna need an answer on that turtlebaum question. Well, Charlie, needless to say, I'm still unpublished, But the good news is so is mom. I think we learned a very important lesson. I look good even in a trash can. Well, that's one of the lessons. - So - I just feel so empty, So abandoned. I guess it'd be safe to say I feel used. You know what I'm saying? PJ, the poor kid been here for 10 minutes. Pay him already.{\i0} Hey, see you tomorrow? Sometimes there's nothing left to say but good luck, Charlie. Poor me. I don't have any toppings, Just cheese. You're a loser, cheesy. Look at me, all covered in pepperoni. There must be something good about being so plain. Oh yeah, when you think of it, let me know. Uh-oh. Plain old cheese or delicious pepperoni? No! Huh, I guess there is something good. About being plain. It'd be a shame to leave just one. I was afraid of that.

Honey, you checked everything but the rolls. Oh, right, sorry. rolls. Okay, fine, you can cook all that other stuff, But I am definitely cooking the Turkey. Wait, that wasn't on the list. Well, I thought it was obvious. I got bogged down on the side dishes, lost my focus. So how did it go? I've got some bad news. What? She's making one dish. Please say broccoli. Please say broccoli. It rhymes with schmurkey. It's Turkey. - Hey, everybody, grandpa's here. - Hey! Yeah yeah, my, how you've grown. Blah blah blah. I don't believe you've met Charlie. Now why is he dressed like a girl? Well, because she is a girl. Yes, Charlie is short for Charlotte. Then why isn't she called {\i1}Sharlie?{\i0} Seriously, I don't get it. You give the girls boys' names. He should be Teddy, He should be Charlie, and she should be P. J. We're not renaming the kids, dad. Good news. I checked my schedule, And it turns out I am available on Thanksgiving. All right, really? Who left the door open? Mrs. Dabney, this is my father-in-law Frank Duncan. Frank, Estelle Dabney. Bob, I was wondering if you could come over. And look at my garbage disposal. - It's not working right. - Oh, I'll do it. Had my own plumbing business for 30 years. Plumbing, now that's a man's job. You want someone to catch a butterfly, Call my son. Let's go. Yes, we're numbers nine and 10! - You're nine and I'm 10? - Yeah. Why don't I get to be nine? What difference does it make? We're both getting mytabs. Then I'm nine. Oh, great, I gotta spend the rest of the day in line. Behind you two losers. Well well well, If it isn't Karl, the neighborhood jerk. If you were planning on getting a mytab, You're out of luck. You're number 11. Not if I outrun you. And when I get my mytab, I'm gonna go online to the losers site. And post something on your loser page. That says, hey, loser! This is gonna be a long day. Excuse me, Karl. I'm gonna zip up the invisible wall now. So we don't have to listen to you. You can still hear me. I know you can. Hey, invisible walls stupid. I'm sorry, what? T, you should get going so you can make it home for your Thanksgiving dinner. Yeah, you're right. Well, I'll be back at 4:00 so you can go to your dinner. - See ya. - See ya. Hey, Ivy, Now that Teddy's gone, I can finally admit that I'm not really a jerk. I'm just a vulnerable kid who's too scared to admit. That he needs a friend. Oh, really? No, I'm a jerk. Loser! Yep, a real long day. Oh, man, this is just weird. - What is? - Grandpa. He seems happy. It's very unsettling. Peek-a-boo, I see you. Peek-a-boo. All right, you know what? We'd better go make sure he's okay. Here we go. I'm gonna get ya! Here he comes. Whooo! Oh, she's a cutie pie! And you were cute, too, when you were at that age, Gabe. Boop. Happy Thanksgiving, everyone! Happy Thanksgiving. She's acting weird, too? Okay, something's not right. This is such a wonderful day. I have so much to be thankful for. Like what? Well, I am thankful. That I have a new man in my life. And I am thankful to be that man. Um So you two are together now? That's right. After Frank unclogged my disposal He unclogged my heart. So it looks like I'll be sticking around. For a while. And who knows, Gabe? Someday soon, You might be calling me grandma. Gabe, let's go for a catch. - A what? - Just go outside. All right, what are we gonna do? There's only one thing we can do. We gotta split em up. Oh, that sounds evil. I like it. Hey, you know what? All we have to do is just help them to get to know each other. I mean, once we do that Then they'll hate each other. - Exactly. - Yeah! Wait wait wait. Should we do this? They are older people. This may be their last chance at happiness. You mean your new mom's last chance at happiness? Yeah, they're going down. - What happened? - Honey, I shrunk the Turkey. Oh no, you must have flash roasted it. Flash roasted? What's that? Well, it's complicated. It's what happens when you simultaneously. Over-breast and under-roast. Put simply, it shrinks everything. - Even the bones? - Especially the bones. P. J. , what are we gonna do?. Well, I'm just thinking on my feet here, - But we do have a deep fryer. - Yeah, so? So if we deep fry a Turkey, dinner could be ready in 90 minutes. Where are we gonna get another bird on Thanksgiving? I have a spare Turkey in the garage. Why do you have a spare Turkey in the garage? Why don't you have a spare Turkey in the garage? - Go get it. - Okay. Hey, mom, are we gonna eat soon? 'cause everyone's really hungry. And would love to be done by 4:00. Actually, dinner has been delayed. P. J. Flash roasted the Turkey. And now we have to start all over. Ivy, hi, it's me. Listen, my mom ruined the Turkey. And blamed it on my brother, So I'm gonna be late. Yeah, no, okay. Don't worry, though. I'll think of something. Just you stay in line. I'll be there as soon as I can. Okay. Mom, oh mom, I have a headache. Wow. So maybe I should rest in my room for a bit. So if you don't see me for, like, two hours or so just remember, I'm in my room. Well, honey, you're probably hungry. Here, nibble on the flash Turkey. Yeah, I'll be in my room. If I boil you, will you plump back up? Who are you talking to? The mini Turkey. Estelle, you make me feel like a new man. - Woof! - Meow. Hey, you know what? I got a really fun game. Called let's not make animal sounds. So, Mrs. Dabney Oh, Gabe, baby, why so formal? Call me Nana. Or better yet gam-gam. So, ha ha ha, gam-gam It's interesting that you meowed, Because we know how much you love your Cat caboodle. And dad doesn't like cats at all. Isn't that right, dad? - Hate em. - Then caboodle's gone. But you love that Cat more than anything. - I thought I did. - Oh. Hey, did you know my dad snores so loud, He rattles the whole house? Good, Mr. Dabney was one of those silent sleepers. At least with a snorer, You know there's a man in the house. And I hope he's there for a long time. Me too. - Woof. - Meow. Hey, how we doing out here? Everyone's really hungry. Dinner should be ready in 90 minutes. You think you could speed it up? Grandpa Frank keeps tracing finger hearts on Mrs. Dabney's back. I guess I could whip up some little sandwiches. - Watch the bird, okay? - Yeah, sure. I'm gonna watch it cook twice as fast. Charlie, are you gonna eat your sandwich? - Yes. - Well, can I have just a bite? No, daddy. I'll buy you a doll. Okay, everyone, Dinner will be ready in 10 minutes. No, it won't. The Turkey's gotta cook for another hour. That's where you're wrong. I turned up the heat. - You did what? - Turned up the heat, cut the cooking time in half. You can't do that. If the oil gets too hot, then the Turkey might Explode. Oh, look at that Turkey go! Oh no, it's coming back down. - Whoa whoa whoa! - No no no! Okay, Ivy, I'm on my way. Yeah, see ya. How you feeling, sweetie? What happened to me again? Turkey fell out of the sky on you. But turkeys can't fly. Can they? No, I guess in cartoons they can. Oh, I like cartoons. Okay, everybody. Fresh from the vending machine. - Happy Thanksgiving. - Well, at least they're Turkey. Or may contain Turkey. Hey, honey, I'm sorry. You gotta eat Turkey sandwiches in the hospital again. I know this isn't the Thanksgiving you wanted. Well, it's not. But you know what? We're all together. Teddy's okay.{\i0} And that is what I'm thankful for. Yeah. Hey, you know what? I am thankful for everybody in this room. - Me too. - Me too. I'm thankful that the patient in room 212 ordered ice cream. I wonder how the lovebirds are doing.{\i0} You can't talk to me that way.{\i0} I can talk to you any way I want, dimwit.{\i0} That sounds promising. Hey, what's going on? He's an idiot. She's a battleaxe. Yeah, we knew that, but what happened? We spent an hour alone together. Longest hour of my life. So you two aren't a couple anymore? No, we are not. And to think, I was gonna move to Arizona with you. Say what now? Wait wait. There's still time. You guys can work this out. I mean, you're perfect for each other. - Oh! - Wait wait, come back! Gam-gam! Well, Charlie, another Duncan family Thanksgiving. Has come and gone. The good news is grandpa Duncan. Has also come and gone. Hey, Teddy, tell me what you think about this. Dear Mrs. Dabney, I'm sorry for our ugly words. Please forgive me. Sell your house and move to Phoenix immediately. Do not call first. Just surprise me. Forever yours, grandpa. I think you'd sign it Frank. Oh, yeah, that's good. I could use that. Anyway, since we never got a Thanksgiving dinner, P. J. Is about to deep fry another Turkey. So just to be on the safe side. Wish me good luck, Charlie. That was the worst shopping experience. - Of my life. - Mine too. I mean, I heard those sales were brutal, But I didn't know they were this bad. And we were so close to getting that last mytab. Then that monster came in. And started throwing us around like ragdolls. What just happened in there? Karl, are you crying? Somebody stepped on my neck. C'mon. And is it really worth treating people like this to get a stupid mytab? Yes.
Okay. Hey, dad, can I go away with Ivy and her family this weekend? Ivy says they have a nice house on the Lake. A weekend getaway? House on the Lake? Crackling fire? Can you bring a friend? Or a dad? Kind of it's not a getaway unless I get away from Me? Thanks for understanding. - Have fun. - Love you! Hey, dad. - Hey, dad. - How are you doing? Anything you boys care to tell me? What makes you think we want to tell you something? That. Well well well, Mrs. Dabney. With a baseball and a satellite dish. - What do I owe you? - Don't worry about it. I still have your credit card number on file. Today's all burnt toast  Running late, and dad jokes Has anybody seen my left shoe I close my eyes, take a bite Grab a ride, laugh out loud There it is up on the roof I've been there, I've survived So just take my advice Hang in there, baby Things are crazy But I know your future's bright Hang in there, baby There's no maybe Everything turns out all right Your life is up and down But trust me it comes back around You're gonna love who you turn out to be Hang in there, baby. Hey, Charlie. - Whatcha doing? - Timeout. - What happened? - I was bad. Could I talk to you in here for a minute? That's a timeout chair? This whole time I thought it was just Gabe's chair. What's going on? Bob, I am so upset. Charlie said a bad word at school today. What? What did she say? Whoa. Our little girl said that? Well, apparently she was making. A macaroni necklace when some kid pushed her, Knocked her macaroni and out came the word. Well, at least she used it correctly. Actually her teacher said she's swearing at a second-grade level. I just can't picture our little angel saying something like that. Me neither. No, I'm sorry. You know what? Until I hear that myself, I don't believe it. You're right. I mean Charlie is the perfect combination of all of our kids. She's got the intelligence of Teddy, The sweetness of P. J. And none of Gabe. To the mountains we will go, the mountains we will go To our cabin in the mountains The Wentzes and Teddy will go. How was that one, Teddy? Oh, best one yet. Are they gonna do this the whole way? If you just said, do they do this the whole way? The answer is yes. So, Teddy, what do you think about the new car? - Oh, it's it's nice. Bought this one right after you wrecked. My old car Gracie in less than 20 minutes. - Remember that? - Sure do. I had such a bad feeling when I saw you drive her away that day, But I didn't say anything. I'll never forgive myself for that. To the mountains we will go The mountains we will go To the Okay, Charlie, Mommy and daddy want to talk to you today about words, - Especially new words. - Okay. So let's say somebody. Knocked over your juice. Now what would you say to that? Oopsy. But if you really didn't like it? Uh-oh. Okay okay, let's Let's say somebody took your juice. Huh? What would you say then? Or if somebody took your juice. And then did this all over you? Are we trying to get her to say the word or me to say the word? -Bob, this is silly. -I know! She's not saying it now because she never said it in the first place. Exactly, she never said it. Come on, sweetie. Let's go get daddy a new shirt. - She said it. - She said it? She dropped her doll and she said it. Oh, Charlie, you didn't. I did, daddy. Won't you come in? Hey hey, we were watching that. Too bad. My story is on. And since you broke my dish, I'll be watching my show here. If you want some of my popcorn, ask for it. - Can I have some of your popcorn? - No. So what is this show? It's called The Tears of Tomorrow. It's about the tears family of tomorrow, Maine. In the last episode, Chance Tears found out. His seventh wife Amanda is actually a Clone. Quiet. It's starting. From the heartaches of today come The Tears of Tomorrow. Yeah, let's go, P. J. - Whoa, uh, who who's that? - That's Tiffany Tears. All she ever wears is a tiny bikini. It's disgusting. Sure is. Ooh, and that's Brick Tears. He's chance's 12-year-old grandson. He's a boy genius with a taste for evil. Move over! Amanda, who is this? I'm glad you asked, chance. This is my new boyfriend Chauncey. What? But he looks just like me. That's right. You're not the only one who knows how to Clone. Man, I did not see that coming. Oh, there's Brick. What's he got in his hand? Brick, what do you have in your hand? Brick, put that weapon down! No! Oh! These have been The Tears of Tomorrow. Wait. That's it? - But what about brick? - And what about Tiffany? She went to change bathing suits and never came back. Calm down. The show's on again tomorrow. Tomorrow? I did not see that coming! All right, everybody, we're here. Where's the house? Oh, Teddy, it's right out there. That shack on the Lake? Ivy, you said it was a nice house. No, I said it was an ice house. But I'll admit, I do run my words together. - Oh yes, we made it! - Well, here we are. Oh, Teddy, let me give you the tour. - Any questions? - Uh, just one. Is that the bathroom? Oh no. That's our fishing hole. That's where we catch our dinner. Ivy, could I talk to you for a sec? Let me give you girls some privacy. You tricked me! I knew you wouldn't come if I told you the truth. Yeah, you're right, I totally wouldn't have come! Ugh, stop complaining. It's not so bad. There is a hole in the floor. Everything okay in here? Oh yes, it is. What is the point of a curtain if she can hear us? I don't know. And why are you still whispering? Those are two good questions. So, uh, what did you guys wanna talk to me about? We'll ask the questions around here. Now why did you teach Charlie that bad word? - What bad word? - Don't play dumb with me! All right? We can do this the easy way or the hard way. - Your choice, punk! - Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Whoa whoa! Sweetie, sweetie, why don't you go take a break? Go take a break. Lme talk to the boy. Wow, your old mom's pretty riled up, huh? You know, Gabe, sometimes we make mistakes. But the important thing is to tell the truth. You can tell your old dad the truth, right? Dad, you can stop. I know what you're doing. - What do you mean? - You're playing good cop/bad cop. What honey, he's onto us! - Oh, man! - Yeah, and there's a little problem with your theory. For me to teach Charlie a bad word, I'd actually have to spend time with her. You're free to go. - Charlie said a bad word? - Mm-hmm. - What was it? - We think you know. No, I don't. That's terrible. What does it mean? You're free to go. And since Charlie spends a lot of time in our backyard, We think she might have heard something. From your side of the fence. What are you accusing me of? Charlie said a bad word and we think. She might have learned it from you. What was the word? I wasn't saying it to you! You sure won't be saying it twice. Teddy, I'd like for you to meet old Betsy. There's a little story that goes along with her. Oh, hold on a second, dad. Go ahead. Betsy was a present from my grandfather. Yeah. He carved her handle from a tree behind his house. I've had her since I was 10 years old. All right, let's get her in the water. Harry, let Teddy do it. I don't think that's a good idea, Mary Lou, Especially after what happened to Gracie Which I've forgotten about. Harry, Teddy is our guest. Now make a gesture. I don't wanna make a gesture! He doesn't have to make a gesture. Harry, gesture! Here. All right, cast away. Not bad for a rookie. Thanks, I've been holding stuff. Since I was little. And now the excitement begins. Is the excitement still beginning or Are we are we in it now? Harry, can you give me a hand? Oh yes yes. Good good. - Have fun. I'm off to the restroom. - Where is it?. It's a nasty outhouse. All the way across the freezing Lake. But it's away from my parents, so I enjoy it. Oh! Betsy! Noooo! Oh no! They canceled Tears of Tomorrow. What?! But it's been on for, like, 50 years. Why now? It says our generation doesn't respond to it. That's crazy. You know, maybe if the kids. Put down all the phones and the video games and the gadgets. And actually watched the darn program Do you think we're spending too much time with Mrs. Dabney? Hogwash. - That's her. - I guess we have to tell her. Hello, boys. Mrs. Dabney, come on in. Have a seat. We have some bad news. - Bad news, you say? - Yes. - What is it? - What's what? What's the bad news? You'd better sit down. I am sitting. Well, there's nothing left to say but It's over. What's over? They canceled The Tears of Tomorrow. What?! No!{\i0} I oh! - Did she faint? - Or is she So all we're having for dinner is rice? Well, usually there's fish on top of it. But someone lost our means of catching fish. And by that, I mean old Betsy. And by someone, I mean you. Mr. Wentz, I promise, right when we get home I'll get you another fishing pole. And are you gonna raise my grandfather from the dead to carve it? Harry, can I talk to you for a minute in private? You have got to change your attitude. Teddy is our guest! Mary Lou, the girl is an assassin.{\i0} First she killed Gracie, and now she's drowned Betsy!{\i0} Sure glad that's a private conversation. You okay, Mrs. Dabney? I'll never be okay again. I don't know how I can go on without Chance Tears. Well, at least you and chance had a lot of years together. Tiffany and I just met. All right, come on. Let's try to find something to take our minds off our loss. Are you kidding? I've been watching that show forever. You think I'm gonna replace it just like that? Hey, what's this?{\i0} Though time may pass, you will never be far{\i0} From The Edge of Yesterday.{\i0} Ooh, that looks good. I can't believe we never found out. Who taught Charlie that word. I don't know, Bob. Maybe it's not important where she learned it. What's important is that we teach Charlie. That cursing is wrong. And I think we've done that. How about a turn signal, you Case closed. Ivy. Ivy. - Ivy, Ivy. - What? I have to go to the bathroom. - Where is it? - It's an outhouse. You go outside and you follow the stench. Thank you. Whoa! What was that? Teddy fell in the Lake!{\i0} - Oh my goodness, come on! - Oh, Teddy! Pull! Everybody pull hard! Come on! All right. Oh, what's that? What's going on? - Aah! - Wow. Hey, you caught a fish. Whoa, and it's a beauty. Look. Look, there's a line in its mouth. What? Oh. Oh, Betsy! Oh, I missed you so much, baby. Teddy, honey, are you okay? Yeah, no, I'm just I'm fine. I'm just kind of cold. - Okay. - Well, Teddy, Looks like you've redeemed yourself. You are officially invited back next year. Noooo! Well, Charlie, a big life lesson today See, when someone says they have a house on the Lake, They might mean they have a house on the Lake. Kind of an offbeat lesson, but Well, not really a lesson at all. Give me a break. I've gotta do a lot of these. Well, at least one person in the family. Learned something. Can I go now? This is boring. - No! - Yeah? Well, if you think I'm gonna sit in this chair. The entire 20 minutes, ho ho, good luck, Charlie. Couldn't have said it better myself. From the heartaches of today{\i0} Come The Tears of Tomorrow.{\i0} You can't threaten me. I'm Chance Tears. Hello, Chance. Amanda! What are you doing here? That's what I'd like to know. Amanda Clone! But I'll handle it, Chance. Chance Clone! Brick! What's goin' on here? I knew this day would come. - Me too. - Me too. Me too I'm confuse. Who's the real one? Who cares? You take two. I take two. These have beenThe Tears of Tomorrow.{\i0}

We're have to move because some cats. -Did his business on the lawn? -Oh, let me finish. Okay, the cat made me think that it would be nice. To have a pet someday. And then I thought, we don't have room for a pet! And then I realized we don't have room for a baby. I mean, he or she should have their own room, right? Excuse me, I'm not clear are we moving or getting a pet? We need a new house. What do you think, Bob? Um, well, we Hey, dad, what was that thing you were telling us earlier? When mom asks us a question we say? I will deal with you later. No no, it wasn't that. Honey, look, I understand your feelings. We do need more room. You know what? I'm on it. -Good boy. -If we are going down the pet road, Could we get a monkey? 'Cause I have this little cowboy hat. That I have never known what to do with. Shall we rehearse for our audition, Mr. Washington? Hit it, Mrs. Washington. Many years ago, after the war was won -We needed a leader. -How bout Washington? He was just the man. To take his country farther. -And the woman behind him -Was his loving wife Martha. Where are you going, general George? I'm off to fight at valley forge. But first I'll lead them cross the water. That's what put him on the quarter! So long, my dear, I'll miss your smile. Here, why don't you keep it awhile? -We're the washingtons. -The washingtons. The washa washa washa washingtons!. And straight and straight and left and left. And okay, open your eyes. -Ooh. -Ta-dah! What is it? -It's the new baby's room! -Do you love it, mom? We spent almost an hour on it. So the baby will be sleeping. Under the stairs. Like Harry Potter? Hey, Harry Potter, now he had some fun adventures, huh? Huh? Say something good about Harry Potter. Quiddich! Honey, look You know what? Look, how easy it's gonna be. To pull the baby out of the crib, huh? Almost too easy! That would never happen in real life. You've dropped em before, you'll drop em again. Hey, mom, check this out. If the baby gets fussy, calm the little munchkin. With an ocean view. Hey! New house, Bob. Got it? Uh-oh. Shark! -What's all this? -Everything you've ever. Thrown, shot or fired into my house. Oh boy, you were a disappointment. Why are you giving all this stuff back? Gabe, now that you're moving away, I've been thinking: You and I have had our differences, but the truth is you've made my life more interesting. You've kept me young. I haven't done a very good job. There's that sense of humor I'll miss so much. Hey, it's my favorite baseball cap. Remember when you lost that? Yeah, I was trying to plant a stink bomb in your flower bed. You know, Mrs. Dabney, after all these years, that's the first nice moment we've ever shared. Bye, now. Guys, what are we doing here? What's the big surprise? This is your new house! -What? -We're really moving? But I love our old house. You'll like the new house even more. -Can't we at least talk about this? -We just did. -So we sold our old house already? -Nope! Still own that one. Normally you sell the old house first. But now we own two houses. Yay. And in this house, everyone gets their own room. Do I finally get out of the basement? You sure do. Uh, here your bedroom is on Level b-1! Ugh, man, It's kinda hot in here. Why are you all staring at me? Why is my cap full of hair? I know where your cap got it. Ahh! Dabney! I got him. Charlie, you like your new home, don't you? No, mommy! Charlie! Is something on your mind? Or should I say not on your mind? You put hair removal goo in my cap! That was for stealing my newspapers. And the funny part is I got the idea on the Internet. This isn't over. Oh, but I think it is. You're moving away and I get the last laugh. Ha ha ha! No, you're not gonna get the last laugh! I'm getting the last laugh! And it's gonna sound like this: -Ha ha ha ha! -Ha ha ha ha! -Ha ha ha! -Ha ha ha! Ha! We have a complicated relationship. Hi. I just got your text. -You're moving? -Yeah. We are. I'm kinda sad about it. I'm gonna miss this place. Um, well, Here's some more bad news. Super adventure land called Oh, and we didn't get it? Actually, you didn't get it. But you did? Oh, but did you tell them. That you weren't gonna do the show without me? Well, I was gonna, But it's supposed to be really hot next week, so Oh great. So I'm stuck kissing a sweaty frog. -Pretty much, yeah. -So who's playing Martha Washington? -Sandy Super. -Who? Milt Super's niece. You know, the guy who founded super adventure land. Wait, is Sandy Super. That really cute girl who's always staring at you. And asking you out and pretending I don't exist? -So you do know her. -Oh. Well, maybe the new frog will be really cute too. Actually, They're giving that part to the guy who runs the tilt-a-whirl. Greasy Joe? -Afraid so. -Don't you have to have teeth. -To play a frog? -Afraid not. Two house payments. Hey, dad, Can I Whoa. What's going on with you eye? Your mother has ideas. Expensive ideas. That's okay. I'll just look at the other eye. So, dad, quick question, How long do you think it would take to dig a pit? -How big a pit? -Eh, I don't know. About as tall and as wide as Mrs. dabney. Gabe, what are you up to? -How much do you want to know? -Is it gonna cost me any money? -No. -Happy digging. Where are you going, general George? I'm off to fight at valley forge. But first I'll lead them cross the water. Take me too, I think you oughter. -Teddy? -Who's Teddy? I'm Ben Franklin. Uh, what are you doing here, Ben? Yeah, you're not in this show. She means this part of history. Oh, George, George, Everyone knows you didn't go to valley forge. To save our country. You went because you and Martha. Were having problems. -What? -So you turned to your best friend, Ben Franklin, who's always been there for you. -No, he didn't. -Oh yes, he did. Then Martha was comforted by Thomas Jefferson, played in this performance by greasy Joe. Oh Joe! Joe! Quit gummin' on that corndog and get out here! And that's how America got started. -C'mon, Charlie. -No! -What's going on in here? -We've got a situation. Someone is refusing to pack. Oh, Charlie honey, you have to pack your toys So we can take them to the new house. No! I'm staying! Yeah, actually I kinda want to stay here too. P. J. , you're not helping. But I have so many great memories at this house. Like, when I got my head stuck in the swing set. Honey, you're gonna get your head stuck. In lots of places at the new house. Promise? I really Hope this one's another girl. Okay, Charlie, what's it gonna take. To get you in a new house today? -Pony. -Done. Bob! Hey, what just happened in there? Well, I think we found out. That Sandy's no good at improv. Teddy, are you really jealous of Sandy Super? No, why would I be jealous. Of somebody who's cute and smart. And rich? Look, Teddy, you have nothing to worry about. There's no one in the world who I'd rather be with than you. -Really? -Really. George Washington, You're the best boyfriend I've ever had. And you're the best girlfriend I ever had, Ben Franklin. Oh, come here. I'm gonna teach you something about electricity. Oh yeah. Well, Charlie, this is it: Our last few moments on edgewood drive. I gotta say I'm gonna miss this place. Come on, Teddy, let's go. I'll edit that out later. Well, see you at the new house. Good luck, Charlie. Okay. You know what? I'll be right out. I feel like I forgot something. Welcome home, P. J. This is where you're going to grow up. -No-ooo! -Hey hey. We are stopping at two, right? Well, actually Aw no. Gabe is such an easy baby. I Hope he'll always be like this. Then all the little ducklings found their way home. And lived happily ever after. Thank you. Honey, find what you were looking for? I did. We can't move, Bob. What? I carried all four kids through that door. I want to do the same with number five. What's going on? We're not moving. We're not moving! Hey hey, unpack the truck! Are you kidding? That's awesome. We're staying right here. In our home. Come on, people, let's get out of here! We're not moving. Mom changed her mind. What?! No no no, we have to go! Right now! Whoa whoa whoa. What did you do? -I didn't do anything. -Help! Ignore that. What's going on? That little monster covered my entire porch with glue. Even the mail. -Gabe, why did you do that? -I had to get the last laugh. Okay, but that's not funny. It's kinda funny. -A little help here. -Okay, hang on, Mrs. dabney. -We'll get you unstuck. -I got it. -Uh -Wai I don't got it. Well, Charlie, we're back to being a one-house family. A one-home family. And we couldn't be happier. I'll edit that out later. Oh, so Spencer and I were fired. From super adventure land. Apparently, Ben Franklin. Kissing George Washington was deemed. Historically inaccurate. Although they did like each other A lot. Hey, guys, PJ got his head stuck in the swing set again. Okay. I'll get my tools. I'll get the butter. There's no place like home. Good luck, Charlie. Many years ago, the founders of super adventure land gathered for a very important meeting. Gentlemen, we've built this beautiful theme park, Now all we need is a name. I know. We'll call it land of adventure super. Of course you'd put your name first, Richard land. Well then, what do you suggest, Frank adventure? Something that rolls right off the tongue. Adventure of super land. That's not bad. Not bad. Let me make one slight adjustment. We'll call it: Super land of adventure. Gentlemen. Terrible news! We've just got this telegram. Arthur Of Is dead. Of's been offed? I'm afraid so. With Arthur Of gone, it's down to just the three of us: Super, adventure, land. Betty, put on a pot of coffee. We're gonna be here awhile.
Gabe, be totally honest. For a pregnant woman, I'm really smoking, aren't I? Yeah. I think silence is my best option here. Okay. Well, I'm off to yoga. Oh hey, before you go This silly old thing. Can I get a quick signature for this thing for school? A school thing? Oh. I Hope this isn't another note from your principal. Oh, look at that. Yes, that's interesting. It's gotten to the point where dear Mrs. duncan is a stamp. You released a bag of crickets in the library? -Why? -Crickets are noisy. The library is quiet. You try things. Let's see. I could try things like grounding you, -Cutting your allowance -Wow, mom, Now that I'm getting a better look at you, You are smoking. -You really think so? -Yeah. Forget it, mister. You've gone too far this time. Your father and I will discuss your punishment later. All right, fine, But you still have to sign this. Wish I had a stamp. Today's all burnt toast  Running late, and dad jokes Has anybody seen my left shoe I close my eyes, take a bite Grab a ride, laugh out loud There it is up on the roof I've been there, I've survived So just take my advice Hang in there, baby Things are crazy But I know your future's bright Hang in there, baby There's no maybe Everything turns out all right Your life is up and down But trust me it comes back around You're gonna love who you turn out to be Hang in there, baby. I'm so glad we're back together. I know. Me too. You know, I feel like when we're happy, -The whole world is happy. -Right. -Guess again. -Oh hey! Wouldn't it be fun cute couple nicknamese. Where we combine our two names? -Like brangelina. -Yeah yeah yeah. Right, okay. So Spencer and Teddy. Oh, we could be spendy! Do you like spendy? I'd like for spendy to hit me over the head with a club. Well, I gotta go -Basketball practice. -All right. See ya later, spendy. I like it. Ivy, why are people giving me dirty looks? Hmm, it could be anything really Your pants, your shirt, The fact that you're a jinx, your hair. Wait. Whoa whoa. Okay, go go back. I'm a jinx? Why would people think that? Well, ever since you and spencer got back together, The basketball team hasn't won a game. But that's ridiculous. Ivy, come on. -You don't think I am a jinx, don't you？ -Well I, don't, But the basketball team does, The coach does, the janitor rse, I am not a jinx! If anything, I'm good luck. Sorry. Hey, looking good, Charlie. I know, daddy. Yeah, you are your mother's daughter, all right. Oh, I'm next! I'll take the race car. Hey, P. J. , P. J. Manager asked me to talk to you. -About what? -Come here. He seems to think you're a little old to sit in the race car. All right. I'll sit on the elephant, But my engine noises won't make any sense. Hey. You're old enough to vote. You're old enough to go to a real barbershop. But real barbershops don't give out stickers and lollipops. Maybe you can hold off on the voting for a little while. Hey, you know what? I'll take you to where I get my hair cut. Uh, no thanks. You're 18. Time to leave the orange balloon and grow up. Oh, great, rub it in my face. Can you believe what Gabe did? No, I can't. I mean, everybody knows when you transport crickets. You don't use a bag, you use a lightly-ventilated box. Focus! Bob, we have to punish him. Man, he's been a handful lately. I know. Well, at least we don't have it as bad as my friend Pam. She's one of the pregnant gals in my yoga class. She has a son Gabe's age who's so out of control. They're sending him to military school. Military school? It's the only way, Bob. You can't have. A troublemaker like him around with a new baby on the way. Still, I mean, Isn't that kinda harsh for a kid Gabe's age? What he needs is discipline, And that's what a school like Graystone academy can give him. Yeah, I guess. Hey, does he know it's happening? No, the trick is not to tell him. Then one day you say, hey, buddy, get in the car. We're going for ice cream. Then off you go to military school. -Wow. I don't know if I -It's done, Bob. And what do you care? It's not like him leaving. Is gonna affect your life one way or the other. Yeah, that's true. Excuse me, quick question: Do you give out prizes with your haircuts? Yeah, if I Nick you, you get a free bandage. That's a joke, right? Okay. Wow, I've really got to cut down on the coffee. You know, I'm actually thinking about letting it grow out anyways. -Syd! -Hi. -Hey. -Have a seat. Well, since I'm here. -What's your name? -I'm P. J. So what kind of cut would you like today? Uh, well, Normally I go for the handsome prince, But today I'm thinking about changing to the sporty rascal. Well, P. J. , I think it's time we gave you more of an adult look. How about we go Shorter on the sides. And then we can layer it on top? Okay. Or we could go shorter on top. And then leave it fuller in the back. Whatever takes the longest. Come on, let's get you shampooed. We're gonna get me shampooed. Okay, don't sugarcoat it. Does everyone think that I'm a jinx? Yes. Boy, no sugar there. Teddy, I'm sorry, all right? It's one of those, -You know, sports superstition things. -But it's so stupid. Yeah, I know, but everyone believes it. Well, then we'll just have to convince them that I'm not a jinx. -How do we do that? -You could play better. That's obviously not gonna happen. I guess you've never heard of a sugarcoat either. I've got it We have to break up. -Whoa. Break up? -We don't need to break up for real. We'll fake break up, The team will think the jinx is gone, They'll relax, you guys can win again. That could work. Okay, so what's our story? -Why are we breaking up? -I met someone else. -Okay, but who? -Serge Lefleur. -Excuse me? -Serge was. My imaginary boyfriend when I was eight. He he had a velvet beret. And rode a unicycle. So your imaginary boyfriend was a mime. Yeah, a mime who could make a layup. Hey! You won't believe this Mom and dad are sending me to military school. Oh, this is terrible! Well, maybe for you, But I just doubled my living space. How can you say that? What, did I get the math wrong? I mean, I know I've been bad, But how can they just send me away? Well, you gotta hand it to mom and dad When you're adding a new kid, You kinda wanna get rid of an old one. What about you? You'll be leaving for college soon. Gabe, everyone knows I'm not going anywhere. Right, Charlie? -True dat. -Mmm. They're sending me to some place called Graystone academy. Graystone academy. Ah, found it. Graystone academy: Breaking boys' spirits since 1873. Okay, there there has gotta be some way out of this. Well, I'm not very good at thinking of things. Okay, go on. No, that's it. I'm not very good at thinking of things. I've got it. I'll just start behaving better. If I show mom and dad how good I can be, Then they'll never send me away. Just one problem, your plan requires you to be good. You have no experience in that. Well, I'm gonna have to learn. It's either that. -Or I'm off to military school. -Bye-bye, Gabe. Hey, what were you dreaming last night? -You kept kicking me. -I dreamt you were snoring. Oh, good morning. Table for two? -What's all this? -You made us breakfast? Not just any breakfast, dad. Three eggs filled with pancakes, Bacon and cold pizza. You made me a boblette? And, mom, a healthy breakfast for you Oatmeal and fresh fruits. Okay, I wanna know what you did right now, mister. I didn't do anything. I just realized what great parents I have. This is the best boblette I've ever had. Gabe, seriously, I wanna know Where you got blueberries, cause they're not even in season. I'll be back later to do the dishes. Oh and, dad, I made you lunch. I still think he's up to something. Oh, dear lord, he made me a bob-wich. Teddy, we have to talk right now. -About what? -About you cheating on me. Well, I don't actu Do we have to do this here, In front of everybody?! You were saying? -I heard you're cheating on me. -Oh. Someone saw you with With Sarge Lefloo. You mean serge lefleur? The handsome, dashing french boy. Who doesn't go to our school? Yeah, that guy. Oh, hold on. Oops. Oh, bonjour, mon petit chou-chou. Ca va?. This is awkward. -Good break-up. -You too. -Hello, again. -P. J. , what's up?. I noticed this morning that my sideburns are a little uneven. -They are? -Uh-huh. There, now they're even. Yeah, but this is kinda my natural head position. It makes me seem folksy. Okay, have a seat. Done! Now you're folksy and even. Heard the news! Up top! -What news? -You dropped him like he's hot, -even though he's not! -Oh. Ivy, we're actually -We're not really -I couldn't believe. You got back with that dog in the first place. Spencer and I are still together. You didn't let me finish. -I love dogs. -Yeah. Yeah, see, we staged the break-up. After they win the game tonight, We'll tell everyone we're still together. And they'll know I was never a jinx. -Ah. -Heard the news! Up top! -We're still together. -You didn't let me finish. Just because. Love, Gabe. He must've done something really really bad. Has anyone seen Mrs. Dabney lately? Or maybe we're misreading this. -What do you mean? -Honey, maybe Gabe has finally turned that corner. And maybe we should be giving him. Some positive reinforcement. Well, I guess if he's trying to be a good kid, We could try to be good parents. New territory for all of us? Hey, buddy. Come on, get in the car. Get in the car? Why? -We're going for ice cream. -No! No ice cream! You can't make me! Okay. Uh, yogurt? I know what's going on here. And I'm not going down like this! -Get back! I won't go! -Hey, whoa whoa! Hey, Gabe! -What are you doing? -I don't want to go to military school. Military school? Don't deny it! I overheard you two talking in the kitchen. Oh, you thought You think that you're leaving today. Your departure date is still being determined. It all depends on how you behave, right, Bob? Right. I don't wanna go to Graystone academy. I want my spirit to be broken at home. By the people I love. Well, I guess I could call Colonel Klink And tell him that we might reconsider. Oh, thank you. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Now There's a bathroom upstairs that's not gonna clean itself. Okay, I'm on it. I'm on it. Wh-wha-what What's going on? -Who is this? -Umm, my 4:30 appointment. Why don't you head back to the shampoo station and I'll be right there? Sh-shampoo? I thought that was our thing. P. J. , you're not my only client. Oh, so now I'm just a client? You've always been just a client. Fine. Two can play this game. Jerry, gimme a shave, please. Sure, kid. Have a seat. -Oh hey, T. -Oh hello, Ivy. Oh, I guess you've probably heard.

Hey, Bob, honey, I have a great idea. -We should have a baby -No! No more babies! Would you let me finish? I was going to say we should have a baby shower. Oh. You should really run your words together a little faster. Is a baby shower even appropriate for a fifth kid? It is when you gave away all your other baby stuff. Because you were absolutely certain. You weren't gonna have another one. What are you looking at me for? What are you looking at me for? So Throwing yourself a baby shower, huh? I am not throwing myself a baby shower. That's tacky.

Teddy, would you like to go to the prom with me? -No. -Wait. What?. Well, first you make a whole big deal out of the invitation, Then you just blurt it out? Where's the romance, the heart?

What are you guys doing? I'm looking through my yearbook, trying to find a prom date. Yeah, and I'm watching him so I can see what mistakes to avoid when I'm in High School. P. J. , prom's this Saturday. You might wanna hurry up. Oh, it's okay. I've seen his report card. He'll probably have two more senior proms. Hey, what do you know about Cynthia Markowski? She was in the gifted program and graduated early. Stupid smart people. Hey, what about Robin Rogers? -She's pretty cute. -That's a guy. Who was your date last year? I went with a group. So now we're calling Emmett a group? There's gotta be somebody out there for me. I just Hope I find her in time. -Hi. -Hi. Here's your pizza. Thanks. With any luck, P. J. May have just found his prom date. Can I ask you something? Sure, anything. Do you guys have any wacky bread? Yeah, it's gonna take a little more than luck. Get over there. Well, things look good. The baby's doing great, but I'm a little concerned about the weight gain. I really haven't gained that much. No, I mean him. Just kidding. We like to have fun here, right, Marcia? So would you like a DVD of your ultrasound? -Yes. -No. I thought we agreed we wanted to wait to find out if it's a boy or a girl. We want to be surprised. I don't like surprises. I want to know. And the person carrying the baby Thinks it's better not to know. We'd like to be surprised. Put this in the Duncan file, please. That's okay. We don't need to know. As long as our baby boy is healthy, right, doc? I mean, the main thing is that our baby girl is doing great, right, doc? Bob, honey, the man's not an idiot. He has a medical degree. Right, doc? Thanks. That was a really fun first date. Taylor, in my experience, you can never go wrong with mini golf. P. J. , I know we just met,. but can I ask you something? Okay, but nothing too hard, cause this date's going really well. My senior prom is this Saturday, and I was wondering if you would like to go with me. -Uh-oh. -Too hard? No, no, no, no, no. It's just my senior prom is also this Saturday. I was really excited about it, and I was gonna ask you. Oh. But you asked me first, so yes. Oh, and just so you know, I would have said yes. Yes! -Then it's a date? -Absolutely. Wait, whose prom are we going to? Mine, I think. -Yeah, yeah. -Yeah. And after the baby's born, mommy and daddy will bring it home from the hospital. But when do they take it back? Charlie, they don't take the babies back. I know. I tried with Gabe. Teddy, there you are. Hey, listen, I was wondering if you've picked out a prom dress yet. No, I really need to go shopping. Or not. Mom, I need to buy a dress. I can't just wear something from my closet. Maybe not your closet. I don't like where this is going. Let me tell you a story that seemed tragic at the time, but is now finally gonna have a happy ending. I really don't like where this is going. The year was 1988, and a young and beautiful Amy blankenhooper was on her way to the prom with her third choice Bob Duncan. But alas, all would not turn out as Amy had planned. Knowing this story would go on for a while, Teddy sat down. Bob Diddlebock, Amy's first choice, took his date out for steak. Bob Duncan had a coupon for the shrimp Bucket. Anyway, it was an all-you-can-eat night, and Amy tried to keep up with Bob, which was her second mistake. A mistake that her beautiful prom dress would pay for dearly. So what are you saying Did you puke on your prom dress? Well, in 1988, we called it hurling. Now this sad little story is finally gonna have a happy ending. Teddy, don't you see? I saved that prom dress all these years so that you could wear it to your prom. I'll go get it. Mom, you really don't have to Ba-bam! Teddy, when this dress goes to the prom, it'll almost be like I finally get to go to the prom. I wish it were you. And, Charlie, maybe you can wear this to your prom, too. No, thank you, mommy. Okay. Whatcha doing, dad? Oh, just thinking about the new baby. Yeah, I like to do my thinking upstairs, just in case someone wants to come down here, play some video games or something. You know, all I want to know is if it's gonna be a boy or a girl. But your mother wants to be surprised. Why don't you find out and then not tell mom? You have a brain of your own, right? Of course I do. It's just that your mother's brain doesn't like it when my brain goes off on its own. Dad, you can't just do whatever mom tells you to do. You have to stand up for yourself. You know, you have to call the doctor and you have to demand to know. -You know what? You're right. -Right? -I mean, I am the baby's father. -Yes, you are. Yes, I do have some rights. Hello. Marcia, Bob Duncan. I don't wanna bother the doctor. I was just could you For me, could you just take a little look-see in our file and just tell me if we're gonna have a boy or a girl? Okay, sure. All right, what did she say? Would I please hold while she calls your mother? Well, face it, dad. Your brain's no match for mom's. But lucky for you, I have a plan. Is it an evil plan? No, no, no. It's a plan that helps the poor. Of course, it's an evil plan. I don't know. Oh, come on. You know you want to do it. Isn't that why you came to me in the first place? Yeah. -Wow! You look great. -So do you. -Come on in. -Okay. Here we are. -What is this? -It's the prom. Your prom is here in your house? Yeah, I'm homeschooled. So this is the whole prom? Just you and me and some old lady? Oh, that's my grandma. She's also the dj. Why's she wearing a sombrero? Because the theme of the prom is south of the border. Oh, okay, that makes sense. For a second there, I thought it was weird. Hola, kids! Let the fiesta begin. Ole! P. J. , this is my mom. -Hi. -Hi. And my biology teacher and my history teacher -and my math teacher. -All right, picture time. Now smile. It's for the yearbook. I know this is a little unusual. I guess I should have told you I was homeschooled. But it had been good information to have Oh, excuse me. Well, at least it's not getting any weirder. Hi yee! So what do you think? I, uh Uh No, relax, I've got a different dress hidden in the bushes. Well, then why are you wearing that one? Teddy, you almost look as beautiful in that dress as I did. Never mind. Okay, picture time. Okay, back it up. You're crushing the ruffles. Good one. Okay, over here. Over here. Over here. Chin down, Spencer. Okay, mom, come on, we have to go. Okay, have fun. Oh, wait! Wait. I almost forgot. I have a surprise. The matching hat! Oh! Oh, now my head can be as lucky as the rest of me. -Hey, excuse me, are you Dr. Karp? -Yes. Hi, I'm Gabe Duncan. -Oh! -Nice to meet you. And this is Charlie. You know, we're here because she's having a hard time with the new baby thing. Hey, Charlie, here's the man who can make you happy again. Talk to him. Will I have a little sister or little brother? Awww, did you hear that? She said, a wittle sisto or wittle brudder. Who can say no to that? I could. What kind of doctor would I be if I told you without your parents' permission? A doctor who's got a little extra walking around money, if you know what I'm saying. It's not gonna happen. I'll be in the exam room. Gabe, get the DVD. It's in the file. Okay. Hey. Hey, Charlie, if you go find the doctor, I'll give you some candy, okay? -Okay. -Okay, come on. Find him. Oh, no! My wittle sisto has run into the exam room! She can't go in there. Daley, Davis. Oh, duncan. Got it. Dad, come on. Oh, there you are, you little dickens. Where's my candy? Candy. For running away? Oh, I don't think so. Come on. So how do I look? Amazing. You look incredible. What are we waiting for? Let's get in there and let people see me. Huh? Oh, who's texting me? Oh, it's P. J. Well, here's my prom night. Turns out taylor is homeschooled. So what was supposed to be the greatest night of my life is now the strangest. But I guess I shouldn't complain. I was voted prom King. Poor P. J. It's his senior prom and he's miserable. Yeah, that's a shame. Okay, let's go in. Dr. Karp, have you seen the Duncan DVD? -I can't find it. -Amy Duncan? No, Angela Duncan. The one who's having triplets. Awww, man, I'm never getting my own room. Hey, look out, everyone. This prom's officially been crashed! -Yeah, all right! -Yeah, uh-huh! What are you guys doing here? We got your text and your prom looked so unique -Right. -That we just had to come. Yeah, what a relief to be away from all those noisy people, laughing and having fun. This is so much better. Teddy, you gave up your prom for me? Oh, please. Going to prom at regular school is so last year. Thank you. Hello, P. J. , are we in the right place?. What's mom doing here? Did you send that text to everybody? Yeah, it was an accident. Grandma was getting kinda handsy during the slow dance. She can't see me in this dress. Is there another way out of here? -There's a door around the back. -Okay, I'm gonna go change. -Cover for me. -Wait -hi, everyone. -Hey, hey! Mom, dad, what are you guys doing here? Well, we couldn't go to our prom, so we thought, why not go to yours? Aww, you guys are the best. -Hey, there. -Hey, Spencer, -what are you doing here? Where's Teddy? -I don't know. She'll be back in, like, three minutes. -Yeah, speaking of three, honey, we really need to talk. -I'm back! I'm back. Hi. Why is your dress on backwards? Okay, all right, mom, the truth is the reason why I didn't wanna wear this dress is because I I just don't like it. What's not to like? On on me. See, the problem with such a beautiful dress is that it only works on you. No one can do justice to this dress like you, mom. Teddy, Teddy, Teddy, Teddy. Honey, if you are suggesting that I put that dress and this hat on because we are at a prom at this very moment, well, the answer would be a resounding okay. Let's go change. Okay. You don't mind being here? As long as I'm with you, I don't care where we are. Awww. Hey, take a seat, grandma. It's not gonna happen. I Hope I get to see you again, but I don't know, I'm off to college soon. -Where you going? -The rec room. Honey, this probably isn't what you were expecting to hear at your prom, but you remember the ultrasound -we decided not to look at? -Yes. -I looked. -What?! Oh, Bob. Don't tell me, okay? I don't want to know what we're having. -Well, can I at least tell you how many we're having? -What? Honey, we're having triplets. Oh, come on, why wouldn't the doctor tell me? I don't know, but I saw them. One, two, three. You mean Seven kids. Wow. I think I'm gonna hurl. Wow! Look at that. She hit the exact same spot. Okay, honey, let's get you to the nurse. Well, charlie, they say you never forget your prom, but I'm gonna try real hard. P. J. , where you going all dressed up?. Taylor's graduation. Back in, like, 20. Turns out, good news, mom's not really having triplets. Oh, and I took mom's prom dress to the dry cleaners, where it got destroyed. Cost me 10 bucks extra. You'll thank me for it later. What did you just say? Wish me good luck, Charlie. Hey, Dr. Karp, well, my grandmother has a very important question to ask you. -Hey, grandma. -Well, hello! You're grandma Duncan? Oh, why don't you just call me Gladys? Anywho, I am dying to know if my new grandchild is a boy or a girl. I was wondering the same thing about you. Dr. Karp. -Mom? -Oh hello, son.

I'm in charge of breakfast today, what would you like? Dad. 20 pounds of raw pig. You want toast with that? No, I need it for bait. Believe it or not, we got a giant snake loose in Sloan's Lake. Look at that an anaconda. What? How could an anaconda get to Denver? -Who knows? -Maybe some kid went to Florida On vacation with his grandparents, Brought a baby snake back. Maybe the kid named him snappy. Maybe when snappy got too big, the kid freaked out. And set him free. Just a guess. Anyway, this is the opportunity of a lifetime. I mean, if I can catch this snake, This is great publicity for the triple-b-g. -Huh? -What? Bob's bugs be gone. -Oh oh! -Oh okay. Hey, dad, can I come with you? I'd love to see you get chased by a giant snake. Hey! I'm gonna catch that giant snake. However it plays out, I just want to see something catch something. -Hi. -Hi. So we've turned into that couple? -I love it! -Me too. -So about tonight -No, shh! Okay, coast is clear. Do we really have to be so secretive? Are you kidding? Do you have any idea what would happen if my mom found out? So when I pick you up tonight, what do we say we're doing? Don't worry. I'll come up with something. I'm a pretty good actress. Okay, first of all, in this family, I am the greatest actress. Second of all, nobody fools mama ames. You bet. Now, Charlie, when you're Teddy's age, You're not going to try to get away with stuff, are you? -Yes, I will. -Oh. Charlie, who's the greatest actress in the family? You are, mommy. All better. P. J. , we need to talk. I've got a dangerous mission for you. Mitch, I am not trying the chocolate shake again. I need you to find out who is stealing chicken from the store. Why would someone steal our chicken? Haven't they tasted it? I don't know, but Corporate is really busting my giblets about this. So I am putting my best man on it. -You. -Oh! Cool. Any idea who the thief is? Okay, I'm pretty sure it's an inside job. So it could be Justin Okay, your meal was $3. And you gave me a $5, so Don't help me. I got this. Then there's Val, the vegetarian Here's your murdered chicken. And finally, big Lenny. You gonna finish that? So what do you think, kid? Who's the master chicken thief? Gut instinct? I gotta go with Justin. Three from five Or was it five from three? Think, Justin. Think. Or Val. Could be Val. So once the snake takes the meat, then I slip that over his neck. And then once I got him, I turn to your camera and I say, take a break, snake! Ha. Dad, I wouldn't overthink the once-I've-got-him part. You know what? I still need a catchphrase, Something Tom cruise can say when he plays me in the movie. How about, boy, have I been miscast? Uh, Gabe, I don't believe you've met Denver's least-favorite animal-control officer. Hello, quint What are you doing here, bug boy? There's a monster snake on the loose, not a termite. Yeah. Shouldn't you be getting some old lady's Kitty out of a tree? Hmm? Muffin can wait. First, I'm bringing in that cold-blooded beast out there. Have you ever caught anything like this before? Does this answer your question? That's a t-shirt. I'm here to catch a snake, not a cold. See that scar? I got that tangling with a great white. -Shark? -Labradoodle. Those things are fierce. Face it, Duncan, you're out of your league. You're an exterminator! What are you going to do, tent the Lake? Uh, no.

So this is what you've been doing? Rehearsing a musical behind my back? Teddy, when did you stop loving me? Mom, I was hoping you wouldn't find out this way. Actually, I was just hoping you wouldn't find out. And you're doing franny saves the farm? That's my favorite musical of all time. Not only that, she's playing franny. Don't help me, Franklin. Hey, let's let's take a five, everybody. Oh, Teddy, why would you keep this from me? I could have helped you, taught you, mentored you. Yeah, and those are three of the reasons I didn't tell you. What are you trying to say? Mom, anytime I try to do something. That has to do with performing, you get involved. And you don't just get involved; you take over. Well, I'm sorry, Teddy. Okay? I love the spotlight. But in fairness, not as much as the spotlight loves me. Mom, I would like for you to not make this about you, just this one time. Please, could you just be my mom? Moms bring flowers, they sit in the audience and they watch their kids. -Well, I -Quietly. Well I'm sorry I've been such a terrible mother. No no, mom, I didn't I told you the spotlight loved me. Clark, cut it out. 14 miles per hour Well, time to get some sleep, Gabe. Got a snake to catch tomorrow. Hey, dad, have you ever knocked out a grizzly bear with one punch? Well, let me think. Uh, no. You know who has? Quint. How do you know that? I'm reading this blog. It's called quint while you're ahead. -Man, is he tough!  -Hey, I'm just as tough as quint. I don't know, dad. Maybe you should leave the snake catching to him. I mean, you're an exterminator. You set off bug bombs and run. I have to run, Gabe. It's government mandated. Time to catch a chicken thief. So glad you all could come over, Justin, Val and big Lenny. And we're away from work, So we can really let our hair down. I let my hair down at work all the time. I lost a scrunchie in the Cole slaw once. Come on, guys, this is our chance to bond, Share our hopes, our dreams, Our darkest secrets. Who wants to go first? Lenny? I'm hungry. Good start. Not a secret, but good start. If we're telling secrets, why don't you go first? Okay. Okay. Uh, sometimes I steal supplies from work. Anybody want to piggyback on that? -I took a straw once. -Yeah yeah. But I felt so bad, I brought back two. -Ahem. Ah -What was that? -What was what? -Sounded like feedback. I didn't hear anything. Mom, what are you doing here? Well, it is children's theater. I thought Charlie might like it. And she has something for you. Aw, Charlie, thank you. Okay, come on, sweetie, let's go. Oh, mom, wait. Um About what I said yesterday, I was out of line. And? And I'm really sorry. And? That's all I got. Okay. Well, you may not have been entirely wrong. It might be possible that I have a small problem with the spotlight. Mom, we're backstage. The lights are out front. That's what I hate about backstage. Anyway, this is your moment to shine. So as we say in the theater, -Break a leg. -Oh. Terrible news Franklin just broke his leg. -He can't do the show. -Well, what are we going to do? I've got to find somebody to play banker Jones, somebody who knows the part. Okay, I swear I had nothing to do with this. Yeah, good day to catch a snake. You're right! It was. I caught him an hour ago, took him to the zoo. You did? -Well, then what are you doing here?  -Came back to do this. Nnnngg! Aw, man, was that quint? Great. So I missed the coolest guy in the world. Because I had to get your potato chips. Hey, the point is, did you get em? So did quint see the snake? Yeah, matter of fact, he did. And then he And then he left Because he was afraid. Quint's afraid?  -Yeah. Can you believe that? Coolest guy in the world leaves because he's afraid. But you know who isn't afraid? Your old man. And I am putting an end to this once and for all. All right. Come and get it, snappy! Dad, are you sure about this? Hey, a man's got to do what a man's got Oh man! This water is cold.

A couple of scaredy cats running from a stupid log. Uh-oh. So that's it? You learned nothing? I learned big Lenny combs his beard with a fork. So we'll never find out who's stealing the chicken. Corporate is going to be devastated. This is going to haunt me forever. -Oh well! -You know, funny thing though. After the party, I came back here to look at our security-camera footage. We, uh, have security cameras? Yeah. Yeah, and it showed this guy who looks just like you. Taking boxes of chicken out of the storage fridge. Do you by chance have an evil twin brother? I don't recall. Then your brother put the stolen chicken in his car. -You got that on tape? -Uh-huh. And here's the crazy part Your brother drives the exact same car that you do. I guess that makes sense though. I mean, you are twins. All right! Quit toying with me. I confess. I stole the chicken. So I could open my own place, mitch's discount poultry hut. Wait. So you don't have a twin brother? Stop it, kid. You got me, all right? Okay. Well, I'm confused. If you were the one stealing the chicken,. Why did you ask me to catch a chicken thief?

Well, Charlie, You were a little chicken. And apparently so was dad. Hey hey! I was not chicken. I was exiting the Lake in a rapid fashion. No, dad, it's all right.

Come on, Emmett, who said that? My dad, my mom, Most of my teachers. I think you did, Mr. Duncan. Well, they were all wrong. I can't believe my baby's gonna graduate. I can't believe her baby's not gonna graduate. Wait wait wait. What do you mean? I just found out I got an incomplete in p. E. That means I'm not gonna get my diploma. Wait, I'm graduating and you're not? This is like the exact opposite of kindergarten. My parents are gonna be crushed, man. This is a disaster. Dude, you can't give up.

We love all of our babies the same. And every one of you has been a baby. P. J. Was a baby. Teddy was a baby. Gabe was a baby. So let me get this straight. When dad plays peek-a-boo with me, he doesn't actually disappear? -No, he's just behind his hands. -Are you sure? Do we have to have this conversation every day? -I'm hungry. -Me, too. I could eat. -Shall we? -On three. Wait, does anyone know how to count to three? Three. What can possibly be going through that little head of hers? I have no idea. Hi, Ivy.

Welcome to the forgotten kids club. I Hope you enjoyed the spotlight, 'cause that's over. No, it's not. Denial. That's smart. Use that. That's what got me through kindergarten. -Hey, honey. -Bob, get over here. I just heard Gabe talking to Charlie. He said we're gonna forget about her when the new baby comes along. What? How could we forget about sweet little Charlie? -She's adorable. -I know, but what about him? -Who? -Gabe! He's feeling neglected. Maybe we're not spending enough time with him. What are you talking about? I just took him to the batting cages. When he was 8. Okay, so, what is he now, 10, 11? 13. Is he still into baseball? Mr. Hammerstone. What do you want, cupcake? -It's P. J. -Excuse me?. Cupcake works. I like cupcake. Listen, I want to talk to you about my grade. -You gave me an incomplete -Mm-hmm. Which means I can't graduate tomorrow. So kind of big problem.

The one that combines athleticism and discipline, And prepares you for the hard realities of life. Square dancing? That's right, cupcake. No offense, but it just doesn't seem that important. Not important. What if you're walking down the street. And bang!  A hoedown breaks out? You wouldn't be prepared. Well, you do make a good point there. Listen, I really wanna graduate on time. Isn't there anything I can do? -Well, there is one thing. -Yes. You can learn how to square dance by tomorrow. Just one little problem It's impossible. Oh, yeah? I say it can be done.

Go on, you just get yourself comfortable, And I will make you some tea. Um, how come you never do any of this for me? I do this for people who study. Not worth it. Hey, there he is.

They might be busy, But they love us very much. -That is so sweet. -What is? Come on. Well, I guess Gabe enjoys being the forgotten kid. Yeah, sure sounds like it. Hey, you know, if we were to forget him, Just every now and then That would be good parenting. You know what? I think I'm going to do my part. And forget him this week. And I shall ignore him all weekend. Mmm. Feels good. Yeah, it always feels good to do the right thing. Well, Duncan, Did you master the art of square dancing in 24 hours? Actually, no. Then what are you wearing the cap and gown for? Look, my parents are out there. They really wanna see me graduate. So I came back here to appeal to your sense of mercy.

Dad, what are you doing in here? Emmett just told me everything that's going on, So I'm here to help you graduate. Forget it. It's over. I can't do it. Oh yes, you can. You're a Duncan. You've got square dancing in your blood. In High School, I was a square dancing champion. Whoa, wait a minute. Are you do-si-do Duncan? Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever.

Mom and dad are gonna choose from one of these. So any favorites, mom? I'm not saying. I see that candy and hot dog have made a reappearance. If you're watching this with your little brother hot dog, Wish him lots of good luck, Charlie. Hey, guys, Mom and dad were talking about this thing called potty training. What's that? You know that room at the end of the hall? The one with the weird chair? Yeah, that chair is called a toilet. They're gonna make us learn how to use it. Toilet? What's wrong with the current system? I am very happy in diapers. Me too. I love diapers. Not loving this one, though. Yeah. I could go for a change. Shall we? I'm coming. You don't get that kind of service on the toilet.
Hey, Charlie. So, exciting times for the Duncan family. Tomorrow, you turn three! Yay! And if that wasn't exciting enough, one week ago, the new baby was due. Let's see how that baby's doing now. I want you out! Duncan kid number five is late. And Duncan kid number two is getting on my nerves. Moving on. Anyway, I'm hoping for a baby girl. I'm hoping for a baby boy. Yeah. Me too. I want a younger brother to pick on. I'm tired of picking on my older brother. Oh, boy or girl doesn't matter to me. Whatever Mom wants, I want. Don't touch me. Never again, honey. Once again I've kept the camera on just a smidge too long. Guys, this is all just too much. The new baby's about to come, and Charlie's birthday tomorrow. Just so long as they don't happen on the same day. -What do you mean? -Well, think about it. Wouldn't it be kind of sad if Charlie had to share her birthday with the new baby? I'll tell you what's sad. We're out of French Toast sticks. Teddy, honey, the baby's gonna come when the baby wants to come. But if it does happen to be tomorrow, I need everyone to help out with Charlie's birthday. Mom, I'm willing to help out by doing what I always do. You don't ever do anything. And nobody does it better. All I'm saying is if somebody goes to the trouble of inventing French Toast sticks, the least we could do is buy their product. Bob, honey, you took care of those things I asked you to handle, right? I. Certainly did. Why was there a pause between I and certainly? No pause. Just my normal speaking. Talk voice pattern. So, you bought the baby's new car seat, and the doll Charlie wants for her birthday? Honey. I did it all. Okay? Mission accomplished. I. Believe you. Uh, Gabe? -Yeah? -Listen, here is, uh. Here's 50 bucks. I need you to go down to the mall. I need you to get that doll for Charlie. Dad, why can't you do it? Because I gotta buy a car seat. You know how some little girls grow up and pick a husband who's just like their Daddy? I'm gonna go a different way. Today's all burnt toast  Running late, and dad jokes Has anybody seen my left shoe I close my eyes, take a bite Grab a ride, laugh out loud There it is up on the roof I've been there, I've survived So just take my advice Hang in there, baby Things are crazy But I know your future's bright Hang in there, baby There's no maybe Everything turns out all right Your life is up and down But trust me it comes back around You're gonna love who you turn out to be Hang in there, baby.

Bought it three days ago. Well, whatever. Looks a little crowded in here. Well, honey, we're gonna be up front. Who cares what happens in the back? Bob, I don't think there's enough room. Sure there is. No, Bob, with five kids, I think we might need a new car. Slow down. No, no, no, no, no. Enough room in here for everybody. Look, Charlie sits here, new baby over there, one kid back there, the other over there. Done. Problem solved. You forgot a kid. Which one? I don't know. But I know there are five. This can work. Let me show you. Kids!. There, see? Piece of cake. How's everybody doing back there? PJ keeps poking me with his rib. It's called breathing. Honey, Gabe doesn't have a seat belt. Or a seat. He'll be fine. Hey, Charlie? Are you comfortable? No. -Bob? -Yes? -New car? -New car. Okay. Here we go. Oh. Hey, Mom? Oh. What are you doing? Painting my toenails. Just because I can't see them doesn't mean they shouldn't look good. Oh. Well in that case, you might want to consider clipping them. Can I help you? Well, I am actually here to help you. So, Mom, I know that you've been very anxious to get this baby out, so I went online and I looked up some natural ways to induce labor. Ooh, like what? Well, uh, there's a bunch of techniques, but the first one includes. Boo! What was that? I was trying to scare the baby out. Well, it didn't work. Okay. Fine, well, there's always some other stuff we can try, like. Boo! Stop that. Okay, you know, it's a baby. It's not the hiccups. So, what do you want to do today? Well, it's a beautiful day. Sun shining, the birds are chirping. So, video games in the basement? Dude, you had me scared there for a minute with all the outdoor talk. All right, let's go. Wait. I promised my Dad I'd go to the store and buy Charlie a stupid doll. And I told my Mom I was at the library. So what? No, Jake, I really have to go do this. So, who's stopping you? I'll wait right here. Yeah, you know I'm not allowed to leave you in this house alone. Come on. Man, you take one bubble bath, you get labeled. What's all this? I got us some yoga balls. Another way to induce labor is through bouncing. All right, I'll try anything. Hit it, Charlie. Feel anything? I feel silly. You look silly. Oh. Teddy, this isn't going to work. Do it again. Dude, I can't be seen doll shopping. I'll lose my street cred. Yeah, I think you lost that when you started giggling in the bra Department. Let's just buy this thing and get out of here. Kuddle Me Katie? That's stupid. Goo-goo. It said goo-goo. Whoa, look what they just released. Attack of the Zartians. Oh, right. I heard about this game. Zartians are martians that were bitten by zombies. Ewe. That's disgusting. What are they covered in, blood or puke? Hopefully both. Let's get it. It's 50 bucks. I don't have 50 bucks. Yeah, you do. Wait a minute. -Are you. Are you saying. -That's exactly what I'm saying. You're gonna buy this game with the doll money. Yeah. -And then what? -We play it. -After we play it? -We play it again. Well, what about Charlie's doll? I promised my Dad. Dude, we're teenagers now. We're supposed to be rebels. Your Mom still picks out your underwear. And sometimes I wear it backwards. On purpose. You know what? I'm gonna buy this game, but just so we can stop talking about your underwear. Hey, Mom. How you doing? I am tired, bloated, cranky, I have never been more miserable in my life. That's nice. Hey. I just did a quick freezer check. Still not seeing the French Toast sticks. I bought you some. Yeah, you bought French Toast squares. Well, if you want sticks, then just take the squares and cut them in half. Cut them in half? But then you cut the fun in half. Honey, you'll figure it out. I guess I could take the cut squares. And glue them together lengthwise with syrup. Or would jam make a better adhesive? I'd better nap on it. That's your big brother, PJ. He's not the smartest. That's it. Hey, Mom. You hungry? Oh, no. Honey, I couldn't eat anything. I'm so big, I just. I just. What you got? Vindaloo Pepper Curry from the new Indian place. Because I read that another way to induce labor is with spicy food. Is it really that spicy? Yeah, so spicy, they made me sign a waiver. And attend a brief seminar. Let's try it. Dad! I set that down, like, one minute ago. Stuff's got some kick to it. What else you got? So, uh, how is belly dancing supposed to help? Well, they say that it's good to exercise your core, and. Let's face it, right now. You're all core. Oh. Check it out, this is fun. And surprise, surprise. I'm good at it. Feel anything, Mom? Feel like I'm kicking your butt at belly dancing. -Oh, no, you're not. -Oh, yes, I am. -Bring it. -Consider it brung. -Oh! -Yeah! Yeah, you just got served. In a bowl, with a spoon. Didn't realize belly dancing had so much trash talk. Man, this is frustrating. Yeah, I know. They really need to make bigger keyboards for people with big, sausage-y fingers. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? I'm trying to figure out what kind of car to buy. Problem is, you got too many choices. And then you gotta figure out. Mileage and. Color, safety, reliability. You know what? This is impossible. Well, what about this one? I mean, look how happy it's making that family. Oh, and they're going across the country. Mount Rushmore. The Grand Canyon. Grandma's house. PJ. Come on, it's just a commercial, you. Hey, they brought her a puppy. Oh, it's just what she wanted. We have to get that car. If we want to be happy. Okay, how is a salad going to help me go into labor? Not the salad, the dressing. See, this place is famous for it. They have this special secret ingredient that just pops a kid right out. It's worth a shot. Besides, I haven't eaten in like, 15 minutes. Hi. Can I help you? Yes. A table for two, please. Sure, can I get your name? We have about a three-hour wait. Three hours? But we need a table right away. Yes, I'm pregnant. It's kind of a special circumstance. Oh, well, in that case, you can wait in our special section. This is ridiculous. I can't believe they're making us stand here like this. I'm seven days overdue. Seven days? Try nine days on for size. I'm looking back at seven days like it was a party. Oh, yeah? I have enough gas to fly to London. Try China. How's that table coming? -All right. -I can't wait to play this game. Yeah, I was getting that from the way you opened the box with your teeth. That's how I open everything. Why do you think I need braces? Now, if my Dad comes down. And asks where the doll is, what am I gonna tell him? Okay, I got it. I'll tell him that. On the way to the toy store, I got beat up by a gang. And. They stole the money and I'm lucky to be alive. Dude, it's your Dad we're talking about. Why are you working so hard on a story? You know what? You're right. Why am I worried about Charlie's stupid doll anyway? All right, here. Uh-oh. What's that? Warning. Contains scenes of graphic violence. Parental supervision strongly advised. Yes! Well, I retain so much water, I slosh when I walk. I slosh when I sleep. Oh, you sleep? Oh, Mom. I just thought of a great idea. Why don't we get the salads to go? Don't you think we thought of that? They don't do takeout here. Sure hope your next kid is smarter than this one. Hey. Nobody insults my kids but me. You want a piece of me? -You want a piece of me? -Okay! Ladies, let's break it up. Let's just go, okay? I can't do this for three hours. What? No, Mom. We have to stick it out. The baby has to be born today. Tomorrow's Charlie's birthday. Honey, I know that. But we're out of options here. Or are we? Look over there. That must be the salad dressing. Okay, so you create a distraction for everyone, and I'll go get it. We're going to steal salad dressing? The student becomes the master. Oh my! Oh my! It's happening. Oh, Mama's having a baby child! Okay, just stay calm. Everything's gonna be okay. -Okay. -Just breathe. Oh, you know what? False alarm. Sorry. Everybody go back to your salads, nothing more to see here. Oh. Let's get out of here. Hey! Stop them, they've got the dressing. Run for it! Oh. Okay. Hey, everybody relax. Yeah, no need to get crazy, okay, there's plenty of dressing for everyone. I am having twins. I want double. Oh, yeah? I'm gonna need to see an ultrasound. Hey, hey! Back off. One more step and the dressing gets it. That's right. You heard her. Now everyone waddle away real nice-like. You first, twinsie. So, Bob. What got you interested in the Serenade? Well, the mileage, safety, reliability. Was it the puppy? Yeah. So, what do you think? Rides pretty smooth, doesn't it? Yeah, it's. It's okay, I guess. Are you kidding? I feel like I'm floating on a cloud. A cloud with seat warmers. So that's why I'm so toasty down there. Sounds like your boy likes the car. Six cup holders?! Serenade! Serenade! Serenade! What do you say, Bob? You want to go inside and we'll crunch some numbers? Um. Could you give us a minute, Stu?. Sure thing. I'll be in the showroom. PJ! What are you doing? You're blowing the whole deal! What do you mean? If Stu thinks we like the car, we're gonna have to pay more for it. We gotta make him think we don't want the car. So there's a chance we won't buy it? Are you kidding me? I love this thing! Serenade! Serenade! Serenade! Never knew pregnant women could be so vicious. It was horrifying. That one gal chewed off a couple of my buttons. Why don't we go downstairs again and try bouncing. Oh, no, no, no, no. Sweetie, we are done. Okay, we've tried everything. This baby is gonna come when it wants to. I guess you're right. And if it is born on Charlie's birthday, maybe that wouldn't be such a bad thing. What do you mean? Well, I don't know, with. Five kids, maybe it wouldn't hurt to double up on birthdays. You know. Less parties, less presents, less headaches. Hey. Maybe I can tell Charlie and the baby they were born on December 25. So, follow my lead. Play it cool. Oh, and whatever happens, don't get too overenthusiastic. Don't worry about me, big guy. I will be cool with a capital K. And don't do any spelling. Check. Have a seat, fellas. In these chairs? Forget it. They're pieces of junk. We're not buying the chairs. Darn right we're not. It's not even that fun. So, what do you think, Bob? Will you be driving home in a Serenade today? Well, uh. I don't know, Stu. I guess it, uh, depends on what you can do for me. Yeah, Stu. What have you got? Bring it. Does this price work for you? Does. This work for you?. Whoa, whoa, whoa. PJ, PJ? We actually have to look at the offers. Amateur move, but go ahead. Look, Bob. I want to make you happy. What do you think about this? This is your offer? PJ. This is your beef, Stu? Get it? Beef Stu? -Yeah, we. We all got it. -Yeah. Come on, Dad. We are out of here. Dad? You coming? I, uh. Chose the wrong child to come with me today, Stu. I. I apologize. How long have we been playing? Six hours. My eyes are burning. You should blink once in a while. That's exactly what they want. Who are you working for, the Zartian King? Easy, dude. Your phone's ringing again. It's just my Mom wondering where I am. Off to voice mail. I'm gonna go down this alley and check for mutants. Cover me. You having fun, Gabe? Whoa. Did you see that? What? My Dad. He was. He was in the game and he was talking to me. That's normal. After six hours, you're gonna hallucinate. Really? Yeah. It was a warning on the box. You've just got to power through it. Okay. You're right. Just got to focus. We got to get that level nine monster. It's your baby sister's birthday. All she wanted was a doll. Maybe you're the monster. Ah! What are you doing? We're done. And tomorrow we're taking the game back and getting Charlie her doll. What's wrong with your hands? I don't know. Help me. Oh, happy first birthday, you adorable baby. Look at that smile. Check out those cheeks. I could just eat you up. You are the cutest baby ever. Yes, you are. It's my birthday, too. Oh, and Daddy loves you. That's right, Daddy lu-lu you. I'm sad. Oh, my little angel. I could never forget you. I'll never forget you either, baby. Not you. Teddy. Morning, Mom. Teddy, I can't have this baby today. Charlie needs to have her special birthday. That's what I've been saying all along. Yeah, but now I'm saying it. Okay, well, what made you change your mind? I had this horrible dream last night. The entire family was just being so mean to Charlie. Ignoring her. Even you. What were you doing in the dream? I was doing what I always do. Fighting bravely to make things right. Okay, look, the point is I can't have the baby today. Charlie needs her special day. All right, well, however you got here, I totally agree. We'll just make sure that you don't have the baby until tomorrow. Exactly. Okay. Okay, operation get baby out. Has officially become operation keep baby in. I need complete rest and relaxation, okay? Nothing but peace. Calm. And quiet. Morning, honey. I said quiet! Yeah. Another day in paradise. Next. Hi, we'd like to return this game, please. Has it been opened? Nope. Then why is it covered in tape and what appears to be teeth marks? Okay. I'm gonna level with you. We bought this game by accident. And then, Jake here. Accidentally opened it. And then we accidentally played it for six hours. Guys, I'm sorry, you can't return this. Oh, no, we don't want to return it. We want to exchange it. For money. Next. Oh, this is bad. What am I gonna do? Only thing you can do. You gotta steal the doll. Steal the doll? But that's wrong. Well, exactly. You know the old saying, two wrongs make a right. No, it's two wrongs don't make a right. Oh. Well, then, you know the other old saying. Sometimes you gotta steal a doll. I'm not gonna steal the doll. Well, can we at least steal candy? No. Then what's the point of even going to the store? Serenade! Serenade! Serenade! Yeah. Oh. Well. Hope you learned something from the whole car-buying experience. Sure did, Dad. What's that, son? Can't we just leave it at a sure did, Dad? I'm talking about the negotiation. Look. Someday you're gonna have a family of your own. And you're gonna have to buy a new car. And you know what you're gonna say to your kid? The car doesn't fit in the garage? What? Then I'll say, it's not my fault, son. I learned all this from your grandpa Bob. And he'll say, oh, that explains it. Then we'll laugh and get ice cream. Well, you asked. Then everybody was being really mean to you. But don't you worry, I did what I always do. Fought bravely to make things right. Charlie, you have the best Mommy in the world. Even in a dream. Charlie? I made you a special birthday lunch. It's in the kitchen. Let's go get it. Yay. Okay, um, Mom. I was just wondering about Charlie's birthday party. Oh, honey. I have to rest. Would you please take care of that for me? Yeah, I got it. Everything you need to know is in a file in the kitchen. Got it. Teddy, you have really been there for me, and I just. I'm just so thankful, and. You're my rock. I don't know what I'd do without you. Yeah. How are the hormones, Mom? All over the place. Charlie, how'd you like your special pony-shaped sandwich? All right. Well. Glad I spent an hour cutting it out. Party folder. Hey, Charlie, come with me. Ready? Oh! I got cha. Okay. What? Mom forgot to mail the invitations? Do you know what this means? No. Good. You wait here. I'll be right back. Dad, hi. Okay. Big problem. So you know how Mom's been kinda spacey with the pregnancy?. Well, she forgot to plan Charlie's birthday party. You think you got problems? The garage is 31 inches too short. Oh, the garage is too short? Now it's the garage's fault? Yeah, car-buying expert here didn't measure the. She doesn't need to know the details. She has her own situation. Didn't you hear? Mom made a big, dumb mistake. Well, so what. What am I gonna do?. Charlie's in there waiting for her party. Okay, all right. Give me, uh. Give me a minute to think. Uh, bu. Bu. Bu. Ba. Okay. Give me another minute. Well, I. I guess I could try calling some of Charlie's friends. See if they can come over. Pick up a cake at the store. Before you buy the cake. You might wanna measure the fridge. Know what I'm saying, Dad? Hi uh, Mrs. Dickson, it's Teddy Duncan calling. Listen, so I'm throwing together a little last-minute birthday party for Charlie, and I was just wondering if Megan could come. Oh. Chicken pox. Poor little thing. But, you know, she doesn't have to stay for long. Okay. Okay, I understand. Oh, you know what? As long as I've got you. Is there any chance that Mr. Dickson is a. Is a clown or a magician, or. Hello? Hi um, is this Cake World? Yeah, yeah, hi. I need a cake. Um. You're out of cake? You realize you're called Cake World. Which means, right now, you're just world. Yeah, well, I don't like your attitude, either. Hello? Hi, uh. Hi, is this Al's Amazing Animals?. Yeah um, listen, I know that it's last minute, but I'm trying to put together this birthday party. What's the most amazing animal you've got? A monkey who does tricks for cake. Yeah, we're gonna have a problem. Um, by any chance. Does the monkey come with its own cake? Hello? Who's coming to my party? You know, I'm really not sure. Hey, you know who might be fun to have at your party? Who? The kids from the playground. Yay! What kids? Well, we won't know until we get there. Yay! Okay, that's as far as I can go. How's she looking? It's a she? How can you tell? Could you just press the button? All right, here it goes. Looking good. Looking good. So close. PJ was right. The squares aren't as much fun as the sticks. But I'm gonna eat some more anyway. So, what are you gonna do? Well, what choice do I have? I have to tell my Dad the truth. The truth? Dude, that game messed you up. You know, if you came in and shared some of the blame, they'd probably go easier on me. Guess we'll never know. Gotta admit. I like that kid's style. Okay, you. You stay right where you are. Little more. Stop! Little more. Stop! Little more. Stop! Okay. We're getting there. No, we're not! This is ridiculous. Dad, calm down. No, that's it! That's it! I'm done. Done! Taking this tank back to the. Dealer!. Dealer's that way. Oh! Oh! It looks bad from this side, too. Dad, I have to tell you some.

You guys have to throw Charlie her birthday party. I'm gonna drive Mom to the hospital. Oh, why do we always get the hard things? You know. I always thought you would be the first one to drive a car into the kitchen. Me, too. Hey, how you doing, honey? It'd be a lot better if you were quiet! She wants me to be quiet. Gotta be quiet. Why can't I be quiet? Dad, were you this panicky when the rest of us were born? Uh. No. Because the first four times we did this, we were at a hospital! We did this, yeah. Yeah, you wanna take over?! Okay, everybody relax. We're on our way. We're gonna be there shortly. Right after this. Slight delay. You're outta gas. You're outta gas! Aw, Teddy. How could you be so irresponsible?!

Yeah, did you get the Kuddle Me Katie doll? What is this, 60 minutes? Just enjoy the party. Charlie. We have got some really fun party games planned. Like. Watching TV! Yay! I want princesses. Really? Uh, did Mommy promise you a Princess? Mommy said, two princesses, please. All right, you heard her, Princess. Make it happen. Mommy said two. Just breathe. I'm sure Dad will find us a ride soon. Yeah, because he's so good with cars? Hey, sorry it took so long. You went for ice cream at a time like this? Uh, well. Actually, the ice cream came to me. You're taking me to the hospital in an ice cream truck? You said to flag down the first thing I saw. Oh what's the matter, the giant hot dog wouldn't stop? Yeah. Okay. Push, Teddy. Welcome aboard Mustachio Pete's, the ice cream truck with the pistachio treats. FYI, pistachio has been discontinued. Bob, I need to lie down. -Okay. -You can use that bean bag chair. It's where Mustachio Pete takes his 10 minute breaks. Which Mustachio Pete is allowed by law. You're not gonna keep referring to yourself in the third person, are you? Yes, he is. That's Mustachio Pete's trademark. That, and the pistachio, which, FYI. Has been discontinued. We get. We. Okay. Come on, honey. If things get bad back there, bite down on a rocket pop. Ooh, cool, I will. He meant me! Can we get going? It's an emergency. Emergency? This calls for the fast-paced music. Ready, Charlie? It's Princess time! I seem to have lost my sister Princess.

Okay. Baby's close. How much further? You're not helping yourself to any freebies back there, are you, Bob? I'm a stress eater, Pete. You don't have to tell me about stress. The ice cream truck business is dog-eat-dog. I got Side Burn Sam nipping at my heels. Could we just focus on the road, Pete? But both princesses are so beautiful. How could I ever choose just one to be my wife? Dude, that's your line. Oh, right. Well, I guess there's only one way. See whose foot fits the magic slipper. Okay. 'Tis not I whose foot doth fit the slipper. Yes, tis not me, either. But, sister Princess, you have not tried on the slipper. I doth not want to. Oh, yeth you will. Or I will hurteth you. With my fitht. Oh, joy. It fits. My bride! At long last I have found you. And they seal their love. With a kiss. Okay, we're done! Yeah, not quite. We're gonna go again from the top.

We got here as fast as we could. Hi. There's the birthday girl. Happy Birthday. Charlie, come here. Meet your new baby brother. Brother? Cool. Hey, what name did you pick? Well, we decided to call him. Toby. Hey. I came up with that one. Nice. Welcome to the world, Toby Duncan. Hey, quick question. Why are you guys dressed like that? Oh, because. Mom promised Charlie princesses for her party. I never promised Charlie princesses. Charlie, did you trick us? Sweetie, did you get your special birthday present, Kuddle Me Katie? No, Mommy. What? Why not? Bob? Gabe? PJ? Teddy? Gabe? Sweetie, I'm sorry. Wasn't much of a birthday, was it? That's okay, Mommy. Now, don't you worry. We will get you your special present. I like this present. Okay, listen up. Here's the plan. So, when they come through the front door, you guys. Are gonna hold up this banner. Here. Take that. And Charlie, you're gonna give Mommy these balloons. And I'm gonna blow the noisemaker. And then we're all gonna sing welcome home, Toby To the tune of the rock classic. Our House. Why do you get to blow the noisemaker? And why are we making such a big deal outta this? They bring a new baby home like every six months. This is what we always do. We did it for Charlie. Did you do it for me? Uh. Yeah. -You're lying! -No, I'm not. Yeah, you are. You. You know what? If you didn't do it for me, I'm not doing it for Toby. No matter how cool his name is. Gabe, just pick up the stupid banner and join in this very touching family celebration! You can't make me. Well, if he's not gonna do it, I'm not gonna do it. And if we not all gonna do it together.  It looks like Charlie could have made it. Good to be home. This is what it's all about, isn't it? Now I see. So let me show you around. This is your home, Toby. Yeah. This is the living room. And this is your family. Tell me who's your angel. Who's your shoulder, to hold your boulders. Tell me when it's raining. Who will warm you. Who will hold you. You might be broken. With all these cracks in your skin. You might be broken that's where the light gets in. You're something beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. You're something beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. And I just want you to know. You to know. You to know. That you're not alone. You're not alone. Hey, what you doing? Giving Toby a proper welcome home. Well, Charlie, it's been kind of a big week. I uh, I helped deliver a baby. Our little brother, Toby. And you finally got your Kuddle Me Katie. Which you lost interest in five minutes after you got it. Doesn't matter, Gabe's still paying for it. He worked out a little agreement with Mom and Dad. Gabe! Diaper change! And it's a doozy. Coming. Wish him good luck, Charlie. Isn't he adorable? Oh, little Toby. He sure is. Oh, by the way, what's his middle name? Wan-Kenobi. Toby Wan-Kenobi? Yeah. Yup, your Dad's a big fan of the movies. Speaking of, where is Dad? I'm ready to go home.

Serenade! PJ Darth Duncan! You're going to wake your baby brother. Oh, sorry. Serenade! Serenade! Serenade! Serenade! Serenade! Serenade!
Hey, Charlie. So, exciting times for the Duncan family. Tomorrow, you turn three! Yay! And if that wasn't exciting enough, one week ago, the new baby was due. Let's see how that baby's doing now. I want you out! Duncan kid number five is late. And Duncan kid number two is getting on my nerves. Moving on. Anyway, I'm hoping for a baby girl. I'm hoping for a baby boy. Yeah. Me too. I want a younger brother to pick on. I'm tired of picking on my older brother. Oh, boy or girl doesn't matter to me. Whatever Mom wants, I want. Don't touch me. Never again, honey. Once again I've kept the camera on just a smidge too long. Guys, this is all just too much. The new baby's about to come, and Charlie's birthday tomorrow. Just so long as they don't happen on the same day. -What do you mean? -Well, think about it. Wouldn't it be kind of sad if Charlie had to share her birthday with the new baby? I'll tell you what's sad. We're out of French Toast sticks. Teddy, honey, the baby's gonna come when the baby wants to come. But if it does happen to be tomorrow, I need everyone to help out with Charlie's birthday. Mom, I'm willing to help out by doing what I always do. You don't ever do anything. And nobody does it better. All I'm saying is if somebody goes to the trouble of inventing French Toast sticks, the least we could do is buy their product. Bob, honey, you took care of those things I asked you to handle, right? I. Certainly did. Why was there a pause between I and certainly? No pause. Just my normal speaking. Talk voice pattern. So, you bought the baby's new car seat, and the doll Charlie wants for her birthday? Honey. I did it all. Okay? Mission accomplished. I. Believe you. Uh, Gabe? -Yeah? -Listen, here is, uh. Here's 50 bucks. I need you to go down to the mall. I need you to get that doll for Charlie. Dad, why can't you do it? Because I gotta buy a car seat. You know how some little girls grow up and pick a husband who's just like their Daddy? I'm gonna go a different way. Today's all burnt toast  Running late, and dad jokes Has anybody seen my left shoe I close my eyes, take a bite Grab a ride, laugh out loud There it is up on the roof I've been there, I've survived So just take my advice Hang in there, baby Things are crazy But I know your future's bright Hang in there, baby There's no maybe Everything turns out all right Your life is up and down But trust me it comes back around You're gonna love who you turn out to be Hang in there, baby. Hey, honey? Hey, come on. There's something I want to show you. Honey, come on. I'm moving as fast as I can. Wide load coming through. Look. Look. New car seat is in. -Good. -Yeah. Bought it three days ago. Well, whatever. Looks a little crowded in here. Well, honey, we're gonna be up front. Who cares what happens in the back? Bob, I don't think there's enough room. Sure there is. No, Bob, with five kids, I think we might need a new car. Slow down. No, no, no, no, no. Enough room in here for everybody. Look, Charlie sits here, new baby over there, one kid back there, the other over there. Done. Problem solved. You forgot a kid. Which one? I don't know. But I know there are five. This can work. Let me show you. Kids!. There, see? Piece of cake. How's everybody doing back there? PJ keeps poking me with his rib. It's called breathing. Honey, Gabe doesn't have a seat belt. Or a seat. He'll be fine. Hey, Charlie? Are you comfortable? No. -Bob? -Yes? -New car? -New car. Okay. Here we go. Oh. Hey, Mom? Oh. What are you doing? Painting my toenails. Just because I can't see them doesn't mean they shouldn't look good. Oh. Well in that case, you might want to consider clipping them. Can I help you? Well, I am actually here to help you. So, Mom, I know that you've been very anxious to get this baby out, so I went online and I looked up some natural ways to induce labor. Ooh, like what? Well, uh, there's a bunch of techniques, but the first one includes. Boo! What was that? I was trying to scare the baby out. Well, it didn't work. Okay. Fine, well, there's always some other stuff we can try, like. Boo! Stop that. Okay, you know, it's a baby. It's not the hiccups. So, what do you want to do today? Well, it's a beautiful day. Sun shining, the birds are chirping. So, video games in the basement? Dude, you had me scared there for a minute with all the outdoor talk. All right, let's go. Wait. I promised my Dad I'd go to the store and buy Charlie a stupid doll. And I told my Mom I was at the library. So what? No, Jake, I really have to go do this. So, who's stopping you? I'll wait right here. Yeah, you know I'm not allowed to leave you in this house alone. Come on. Man, you take one bubble bath, you get labeled. What's all this? I got us some yoga balls. Another way to induce labor is through bouncing. All right, I'll try anything. Hit it, Charlie. Feel anything? I feel silly. You look silly. Oh. Teddy, this isn't going to work. Do it again. Dude, I can't be seen doll shopping. I'll lose my street cred. Yeah, I think you lost that when you started giggling in the bra Department. Let's just buy this thing and get out of here. Kuddle Me Katie? That's stupid. Goo-goo. It said goo-goo. Whoa, look what they just released. Attack of the Zartians. Oh, right. I heard about this game. Zartians are martians that were bitten by zombies. Ewe. That's disgusting. What are they covered in, blood or puke? Hopefully both. Let's get it. It's 50 bucks. I don't have 50 bucks. Yeah, you do. Wait a minute. -Are you. Are you saying. -That's exactly what I'm saying. You're gonna buy this game with the doll money. Yeah. -And then what? -We play it. -After we play it? -We play it again. Well, what about Charlie's doll? I promised my Dad. Dude, we're teenagers now. We're supposed to be rebels. Your Mom still picks out your underwear. And sometimes I wear it backwards. On purpose. You know what? I'm gonna buy this game, but just so we can stop talking about your underwear. Hey, Mom. How you doing? I am tired, bloated, cranky, I have never been more miserable in my life. That's nice. Hey. I just did a quick freezer check. Still not seeing the French Toast sticks. I bought you some. Yeah, you bought French Toast squares. Well, if you want sticks, then just take the squares and cut them in half. Cut them in half? But then you cut the fun in half. Honey, you'll figure it out. I guess I could take the cut squares. And glue them together lengthwise with syrup. Or would jam make a better adhesive? I'd better nap on it. That's your big brother, PJ. He's not the smartest. That's it. Hey, Mom. You hungry? Oh, no. Honey, I couldn't eat anything. I'm so big, I just. I just. What you got? Vindaloo Pepper Curry from the new Indian place. Because I read that another way to induce labor is with spicy food. Is it really that spicy? Yeah, so spicy, they made me sign a waiver. And attend a brief seminar. Let's try it. Dad! I set that down, like, one minute ago. Stuff's got some kick to it. What else you got? So, uh, how is belly dancing supposed to help? Well, they say that it's good to exercise your core, and. Let's face it, right now. You're all core. Oh. Check it out, this is fun. And surprise, surprise. I'm good at it. Feel anything, Mom? Feel like I'm kicking your butt at belly dancing. -Oh, no, you're not. -Oh, yes, I am. -Bring it. -Consider it brung. -Oh! -Yeah! Yeah, you just got served. In a bowl, with a spoon. Didn't realize belly dancing had so much trash talk. Man, this is frustrating. Yeah, I know. They really need to make bigger keyboards for people with big, sausage-y fingers. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? I'm trying to figure out what kind of car to buy. Problem is, you got too many choices. And then you gotta figure out. Mileage and. Color, safety, reliability. You know what? This is impossible. Well, what about this one? I mean, look how happy it's making that family. Oh, and they're going across the country. Mount Rushmore. The Grand Canyon. Grandma's house. PJ. Come on, it's just a commercial, you. Hey, they brought her a puppy. Oh, it's just what she wanted. We have to get that car. If we want to be happy. Okay, how is a salad going to help me go into labor? Not the salad, the dressing. See, this place is famous for it. They have this special secret ingredient that just pops a kid right out. It's worth a shot. Besides, I haven't eaten in like, 15 minutes. Hi. Can I help you? Yes. A table for two, please. Sure, can I get your name? We have about a three-hour wait. Three hours? But we need a table right away. Yes, I'm pregnant. It's kind of a special circumstance. Oh, well, in that case, you can wait in our special section. This is ridiculous. I can't believe they're making us stand here like this. I'm seven days overdue. Seven days? Try nine days on for size. I'm looking back at seven days like it was a party. Oh, yeah? I have enough gas to fly to London. Try China. How's that table coming? -All right. -I can't wait to play this game. Yeah, I was getting that from the way you opened the box with your teeth. That's how I open everything. Why do you think I need braces? Now, if my Dad comes down. And asks where the doll is, what am I gonna tell him? Okay, I got it. I'll tell him that. On the way to the toy store, I got beat up by a gang. And. They stole the money and I'm lucky to be alive. Dude, it's your Dad we're talking about. Why are you working so hard on a story? You know what? You're right. Why am I worried about Charlie's stupid doll anyway? All right, here. Uh-oh. What's that? Warning. Contains scenes of graphic violence. Parental supervision strongly advised. Yes! Well, I retain so much water, I slosh when I walk. I slosh when I sleep. Oh, you sleep? Oh, Mom. I just thought of a great idea. Why don't we get the salads to go? Don't you think we thought of that? They don't do takeout here. Sure hope your next kid is smarter than this one. Hey. Nobody insults my kids but me. You want a piece of me? -You want a piece of me? -Okay! Ladies, let's break it up. Let's just go, okay? I can't do this for three hours. What? No, Mom. We have to stick it out. The baby has to be born today. Tomorrow's Charlie's birthday. Honey, I know that. But we're out of options here. Or are we? Look over there. That must be the salad dressing. Okay, so you create a distraction for everyone, and I'll go get it. We're going to steal salad dressing? The student becomes the master. Oh my! Oh my! It's happening. Oh, Mama's having a baby child! Okay, just stay calm. Everything's gonna be okay. -Okay. -Just breathe. Oh, you know what? False alarm. Sorry. Everybody go back to your salads, nothing more to see here. Oh. Let's get out of here. Hey! Stop them, they've got the dressing. Run for it! Oh. Okay. Hey, everybody relax. Yeah, no need to get crazy, okay, there's plenty of dressing for everyone. I am having twins. I want double. Oh, yeah? I'm gonna need to see an ultrasound. Hey, hey! Back off. One more step and the dressing gets it. That's right. You heard her. Now everyone waddle away real nice-like. You first, twinsie. So, Bob. What got you interested in the Serenade? Well, the mileage, safety, reliability. Was it the puppy? Yeah. So, what do you think? Rides pretty smooth, doesn't it? Yeah, it's. It's okay, I guess. Are you kidding? I feel like I'm floating on a cloud. A cloud with seat warmers. So that's why I'm so toasty down there. Sounds like your boy likes the car. Six cup holders?! Serenade! Serenade! Serenade! What do you say, Bob? You want to go inside and we'll crunch some numbers? Um. Could you give us a minute, Stu?. Sure thing. I'll be in the showroom. PJ! What are you doing? You're blowing the whole deal! What do you mean? If Stu thinks we like the car, we're gonna have to pay more for it. We gotta make him think we don't want the car. So there's a chance we won't buy it? Are you kidding me? I love this thing! Serenade! Serenade! Serenade! Never knew pregnant women could be so vicious. It was horrifying. That one gal chewed off a couple of my buttons. Why don't we go downstairs again and try bouncing. Oh, no, no, no, no. Sweetie, we are done. Okay, we've tried everything. This baby is gonna come when it wants to. I guess you're right. And if it is born on Charlie's birthday, maybe that wouldn't be such a bad thing. What do you mean? Well, I don't know, with. Five kids, maybe it wouldn't hurt to double up on birthdays. You know. Less parties, less presents, less headaches. Hey. Maybe I can tell Charlie and the baby they were born on December 25. So, follow my lead. Play it cool. Oh, and whatever happens, don't get too overenthusiastic. Don't worry about me, big guy. I will be cool with a capital K. And don't do any spelling. Check. Have a seat, fellas. In these chairs? Forget it. They're pieces of junk. We're not buying the chairs. Darn right we're not. It's not even that fun. So, what do you think, Bob? Will you be driving home in a Serenade today? Well, uh. I don't know, Stu. I guess it, uh, depends on what you can do for me. Yeah, Stu. What have you got? Bring it. Does this price work for you? Does. This work for you?. Whoa, whoa, whoa. PJ, PJ? We actually have to look at the offers. Amateur move, but go ahead. Look, Bob. I want to make you happy. What do you think about this? This is your offer? PJ. This is your beef, Stu? Get it? Beef Stu? -Yeah, we. We all got it. -Yeah. Come on, Dad. We are out of here. Dad? You coming? I, uh. Chose the wrong child to come with me today, Stu. I. I apologize. How long have we been playing? Six hours. My eyes are burning. You should blink once in a while. That's exactly what they want. Who are you working for, the Zartian King? Easy, dude. Your phone's ringing again. It's just my Mom wondering where I am. Off to voice mail. I'm gonna go down this alley and check for mutants. Cover me. You having fun, Gabe? Whoa. Did you see that? What? My Dad. He was. He was in the game and he was talking to me. That's normal. After six hours, you're gonna hallucinate. Really? Yeah. It was a warning on the box. You've just got to power through it. Okay. You're right. Just got to focus. We got to get that level nine monster. It's your baby sister's birthday. All she wanted was a doll. Maybe you're the monster. Ah! What are you doing? We're done. And tomorrow we're taking the game back and getting Charlie her doll. What's wrong with your hands? I don't know. Help me. Oh, happy first birthday, you adorable baby. Look at that smile. Check out those cheeks. I could just eat you up. You are the cutest baby ever. Yes, you are. It's my birthday, too. Oh, and Daddy loves you. That's right, Daddy lu-lu you. I'm sad. Oh, my little angel. I could never forget you. I'll never forget you either, baby. Not you. Teddy. Morning, Mom. Teddy, I can't have this baby today. Charlie needs to have her special birthday. That's what I've been saying all along. Yeah, but now I'm saying it. Okay, well, what made you change your mind? I had this horrible dream last night. The entire family was just being so mean to Charlie. Ignoring her. Even you. What were you doing in the dream? I was doing what I always do. Fighting bravely to make things right. Okay, look, the point is I can't have the baby today. Charlie needs her special day. All right, well, however you got here, I totally agree. We'll just make sure that you don't have the baby until tomorrow. Exactly. Okay. Okay, operation get baby out. Has officially become operation keep baby in. I need complete rest and relaxation, okay? Nothing but peace. Calm. And quiet. Morning, honey. I said quiet! Yeah. Another day in paradise. Next. Hi, we'd like to return this game, please. Has it been opened? Nope. Then why is it covered in tape and what appears to be teeth marks? Okay. I'm gonna level with you. We bought this game by accident. And then, Jake here. Accidentally opened it. And then we accidentally played it for six hours. Guys, I'm sorry, you can't return this. Oh, no, we don't want to return it. We want to exchange it. For money. Next. Oh, this is bad. What am I gonna do? Only thing you can do. You gotta steal the doll. Steal the doll? But that's wrong. Well, exactly. You know the old saying, two wrongs make a right. No, it's two wrongs don't make a right. Oh. Well, then, you know the other old saying. Sometimes you gotta steal a doll. I'm not gonna steal the doll. Well, can we at least steal candy? No. Then what's the point of even going to the store? Serenade! Serenade! Serenade! Yeah. Oh. Well. Hope you learned something from the whole car-buying experience. Sure did, Dad. What's that, son? Can't we just leave it at a sure did, Dad? I'm talking about the negotiation. Look. Someday you're gonna have a family of your own. And you're gonna have to buy a new car. And you know what you're gonna say to your kid? The car doesn't fit in the garage? What? Then I'll say, it's not my fault, son. I learned all this from your grandpa Bob. And he'll say, oh, that explains it. Then we'll laugh and get ice cream. Well, you asked. Then everybody was being really mean to you. But don't you worry, I did what I always do. Fought bravely to make things right. Charlie, you have the best Mommy in the world. Even in a dream. Charlie? I made you a special birthday lunch. It's in the kitchen. Let's go get it. Yay. Okay, um, Mom. I was just wondering about Charlie's birthday party. Oh, honey. I have to rest. Would you please take care of that for me? Yeah, I got it. Everything you need to know is in a file in the kitchen. Got it. Teddy, you have really been there for me, and I just. I'm just so thankful, and. You're my rock. I don't know what I'd do without you. Yeah. How are the hormones, Mom? All over the place. Charlie, how'd you like your special pony-shaped sandwich? All right. Well. Glad I spent an hour cutting it out. Party folder. Hey, Charlie, come with me. Ready? Oh! I got cha. Okay. What? Mom forgot to mail the invitations? Do you know what this means? No. Good. You wait here. I'll be right back. Dad, hi. Okay. Big problem. So you know how Mom's been kinda spacey with the pregnancy?. Well, she forgot to plan Charlie's birthday party. You think you got problems? The garage is 31 inches too short. Oh, the garage is too short? Now it's the garage's fault? Yeah, car-buying expert here didn't measure the. She doesn't need to know the details. She has her own situation. Didn't you hear? Mom made a big, dumb mistake. Well, so what. What am I gonna do?. Charlie's in there waiting for her party. Okay, all right. Give me, uh. Give me a minute to think. Uh, bu. Bu. Bu. Ba. Okay. Give me another minute. Well, I. I guess I could try calling some of Charlie's friends. See if they can come over. Pick up a cake at the store. Before you buy the cake. You might wanna measure the fridge. Know what I'm saying, Dad? Hi uh, Mrs. Dickson, it's Teddy Duncan calling. Listen, so I'm throwing together a little last-minute birthday party for Charlie, and I was just wondering if Megan could come. Oh. Chicken pox. Poor little thing. But, you know, she doesn't have to stay for long. Okay. Okay, I understand. Oh, you know what? As long as I've got you. Is there any chance that Mr. Dickson is a. Is a clown or a magician, or. Hello? Hi um, is this Cake World? Yeah, yeah, hi. I need a cake. Um. You're out of cake? You realize you're called Cake World. Which means, right now, you're just world. Yeah, well, I don't like your attitude, either. Hello? Hi, uh. Hi, is this Al's Amazing Animals?. Yeah um, listen, I know that it's last minute, but I'm trying to put together this birthday party. What's the most amazing animal you've got? A monkey who does tricks for cake. Yeah, we're gonna have a problem. Um, by any chance. Does the monkey come with its own cake? Hello? Who's coming to my party? You know, I'm really not sure. Hey, you know who might be fun to have at your party? Who? The kids from the playground. Yay! What kids?

Looking good. So close. PJ was right. The squares aren't as much fun as the sticks. But I'm gonna eat some more anyway. So, what are you gonna do? Well, what choice do I have? I have to tell my Dad the truth. The truth? Dude, that game messed you up. You know, if you came in and shared some of the blame, they'd probably go easier on me. Guess we'll never know. Gotta admit. I like that kid's style. Okay, you. You stay right where you are. Little more. Stop! Little more. Stop! Little more. Stop! Okay. We're getting there. No, we're not! This is ridiculous.

Why can't I be quiet? Dad, were you this panicky when the rest of us were born? Uh. No. Because the first four times we did this, we were at a hospital! We did this, yeah. Yeah, you wanna take over?! Okay, everybody relax. We're on our way. We're gonna be there shortly. Right after this. Slight delay. You're outta gas. You're outta gas! Aw, Teddy. How could you be so irresponsible?!

You're taking me to the hospital in an ice cream truck? You said to flag down the first thing I saw. Oh what's the matter, the giant hot dog wouldn't stop? Yeah. Okay. Push, Teddy. Welcome aboard Mustachio Pete's, the ice cream truck with the pistachio treats. FYI, pistachio has been discontinued. Bob, I need to lie down. -Okay. -You can use that bean bag chair. It's where Mustachio Pete takes his 10 minute breaks. Which Mustachio Pete is allowed by law. You're not gonna keep referring to yourself in the third person, are you? Yes, he is. That's Mustachio Pete's trademark. That, and the pistachio, which, FYI. Has been discontinued. We get. We. Okay. Come on, honey. If things get bad back there, bite down on a rocket pop.

Okay. Baby's close. How much further? You're not helping yourself to any freebies back there, are you, Bob? I'm a stress eater, Pete. You don't have to tell me about stress. The ice cream truck business is dog-eat-dog. I got Side Burn Sam nipping at my heels. Could we just focus on the road, Pete? But both princesses are so beautiful. How could I ever choose just one to be my wife? Dude, that's your line. Oh, right. Well, I guess there's only one way. See whose foot fits the magic slipper. Okay. 'Tis not I whose foot doth fit the slipper. Yes, tis not me, either. But, sister Princess, you have not tried on the slipper. I doth not want to. Oh, yeth you will. Or I will hurteth you.

Can't you just get through it? I don't know. After the baby, I'm all hormonal, Just I don't have my usual censor. You have a censor? Teddy, you have to help me, okay? You gotta keep grandma away from me. Yeah, sure. I I love spending time. With grandma. And just in case she gets on my nerves, We need a code word. You know, something I can say. In case I'm about to blow. Platypi. that's a fun word. It's the plural for platypus. Oh, honey. I need something that I can work into a conversation. Um Apple. I was at the zoo and I saw two platypi. How easy is that? We'll go with apple. Meh. No. Oh. hey. Check out this old comic book. Gila Monster Man. Gila monster man? what's that about? By day, he's mild mannered photographer, Gil A. Muenster. By night, he's a crime-fighting superhero. Gila monster man. All right, what's his super power? When he hides under hot rocks, His body temperature rises. And gives him the ability to scorch villains. I'd hate to be the geek with that lunch box. You know? -What's that? -Just some old letter. Hey, it's dated july 9, 1924. -Wow. -Listen to this. My dearest brother, As I am very ill, I send you this letter with great urgency. As you know, in spite of my great wealth, I have had a lifelong distrust of banks. What does gila monster man do during the winter? Quiet, quiet, quiet. Blah, blah, blah, blah All my money is buried in the backyard of my home, 10 feet due east from the oak tree, And four feet deep. With loving regard, your brother, Orville. Wait a minute, look at this. He lived in mrs. Dabney's house. And the letter was never mailed. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? We gotta get to the post office. PJ, the letter was never mailed. No one knows about the money. It's probably still there. So when mrs. Dabney's gone, We go dig it up. Oh. And we're rich. Well, of course, the right thing to do. Would be to split it evenly with mrs. Dabney. We're gonna do the wrong thing, though, aren't we? Move it back. There. Now, isn't that better, bobby? It is better, mommy. Hi. What's going on? Oh, just a little rearranging and whatnot. Oh. Is that a good idea? Oh, yes. It's an ancient chinese art. It's called fung shooey. Hey, hon. come on in here a second. Huh? What do you think? Love it. It's easier to clean this way. I know that's always been a challenge for you. Apple. What? Mom's probably just talking about. What we're gonna have for dinner tonight. Apple? Don't you think we need something. A little more filling? Apple. Grandma, you haven't seen my room. Come see my room. Okay. So, like a caramel apple? Thanks for the tour of your room, sweetheart. It was certainly through. Oh, no. uh, wait. Um Let's do something. You know, just you and me. I need some more grandma time. All righty. I'm not sure you're going to enjoy it, But I have an idea that might be fun. Extreme couponing. Extreme couponing? Well, let me explain how it works. Now this one's worth 50 cents, But it's a double coupon. Which means it's actually worth a dollar. Cool! If I use this one on a qualifying item, It's triple times the double. Believe it or not, I once got a case of pickle relish. For 12 cents. How was it? Well, I'm not a pickle person. Um Buy one 5-pound bag of kitty litter, Get the second bag free. Don't forget to triple your double. This is awesome. You know, we don't have a cat, But if we did, he'd be pooping for free. Shh. shh. Guys I know I'm going to regret asking this, but Where are you going with that stuff? -The library. -We're in a play. Uh We're in a play at the library. And what is the name of the play? Shovel Kids.

Do you know anything about this? The murders? Yeah. They were never solved. Most people up here think the killer was. I've said too much. You never say enough. Please, finish your sentences. Some folks think the killer is the angry spirit of. Commodore Elijah T. Deadman. Of course other folks have a different theory. Okay. What's that? That it's me. Well, Shaggy and Scooby are convinced the house is haunted by a killer ghost. Bob, come here. Look at this. Ivy's giving Teddy soup. So? So, she's given her soup three times in the last hour. It's like it's on a continuous loop. You think Teddy's up to something? She's my daughter. I know she's up to something. Of course, she's your daughter, too, so she shouldn't able to pull it off.

Oh. Is this a great party or what? No, really. I'm asking. I have no frame of reference. Hey, where's Mrs. Dabney? I thought she was supposed to be coming over? Maybe she couldn't find something to wear. Where's your turntable? I'm ready to boogie! Okay, what was that? It's the ghost. -Or the killer. -Or the killer ghost. Or the ghost killer. Bob, wake up.

You people are disgusting. We're gonna be on TV, you say? When the Duncans checked into Scary House, They had no idea what they were in for. Wow, mom. That was quite a scream. Yeah, that was PJ. And if you want to see something really scary, Check out what we saw on mama Duncan's laptop. What was that? Um. That is called the hustle. It was a very popular dance move in the 1970s. And what was it doing in our living room? Look, mom. I don't have time for all these questions. Because I have to do my video diary. Hi, Charlie. well, we have had quite a weekend. But you know what?

Far out, man. I can dig it. -Howdy, folks. -Oh!.
Morning, mom. Eh. Tough night? I had to get up three times with the baby and your father was absolutely no help. Sure I was. Flicking me in the forehead and saying baby's crying is not helpful. Honey, if I flicked you in the forehead and didn't say anything, It's just being mean Hey, after breakfast, if somebody watch Toby while I grab a shower? Oh, I can't. I have a maggot-infested rats' nest that needs my attention. -Bye. -Bye. Sorry, mom. I'd love to, but I'm going to the mall with Ivy. We're gonna shop and look for jobs. Mostly shop. See you.

Okay, Charlie. Here we go. Have fun. Not too fast. Not too fast. She's already the fastest kid in the park. If you want to see fast, you should see my nephew Mason ride his trike. You know what his friends call him? -What? -Nothing. He's so fast, he doesn't have time to make friends. Yeah, well, Charlie's so fast, that. that she makes friends. But then she goes so far, by the time she comes back they've changed their move on And. I am really not good at this. The point is, Mason's faster. No. Charlie's faster.

But mostly shop. -Wallet's over there. -How much can I take? Doesn't matter. Nothing matters. Ivy, why is your dad so depressed? I don't know. I think it might be something about his job. -What does he do? -I don't know. Ivy, you're not going to the mall without cleaning your room, are you? Oh, Harry, honey. I don't know why you're so down. Show Teddy the award you got last night. That's the silver plungie. It's in recognition of Harry's 25 years in the plumbing supply business. Oh, congratulations, Mr. Wentz. That is quite an honor. Well, I think so. It even has an inscription. see?. It says, to harry wentz, for 25 years of duty. Well, that's unfortunate. Oh, I'm gonna go find a place for it. Is this all I have to show. For 25 years of my life? A plunger that they spray-painted silver. It's glittery, too. I used to have dreams. Big dreams. I wanted to be. A weatherman. I wanted to open a restaurant. But. I'm too old for any of that now. Mr. Wentz, you are never too old to pursue your dreams. Oh, Teddy, I don't know. Have you seen that commercial for the new fitness centers? The one with the talking gophers? Right. The skinny gopher says to the fat gopher. If you want to lose that weight, you gotta get off your butt and go for it. Sure, it's a terrific commercial. But what's your point? That's what you gotta do, Mr. Wentz. You gotta follow your dreams and gopher it! Gopher it. Gopher it. Why are you dressed like that? Why are you dressed like that? Because I haven't had a chance to do the laundry. Believe it or not, this is your shirt, your dad's sweats, And you don't even want to know whose underwear I have on. -They're PJ's. -You don't know that. I can see batman's head on the waistband. What is that smell? That's my new body spray. Check it out. Duude. With two us. Body spray for cool dudes ages 12 to 13. What's all this about? Nothing. Oh, and by the way, for the next couple of days, I'm gonna be working on a project with a kid from summer school. Oh, I see. Is this kid a boy kid or a girl kid? I don't remember. When I'm at school I'm all about the work. Aw. My little baby has a crush. Honey, can I give you some advice? I'm 13 now. I don't need any help from my mommy. That's a direct quote from the Duude commercial. Get out! Okay. I got all dressed up for nothing? Hi, Gabe. Hi, Jade. I like hanging out at your house. It's always so nice and pieceful. You did what?! Without even asking me? Harry, you come back here! Girls, I have some exciting news. Your father quit his job, took our life savings, and bought a restaurant. I combined both my passions and created the world's first weather themed eatery. Hurricane Harry's weather cafe. And I owe it all to teddy. What did I do? You did this. And we're all gonna work there. Me? What did I do? Well, you wanted jobs? Now you got them. -That's okay, Mr. Wentz. -Oh, no, no, no, no, Teddy. You are going to be a part of this, too. Because of you, this family is taking a ride on a crazy train. All aboard. Woo-woo. Hmm. Ah. Okay. Charlie, I've made some adjustments. Your trike is now more airdynamic. Where's my bell? Oh, you don't need a bell, you'll be in front all the time. Right? Yes. Well, well, well. You here to back out? No, I'm here to show you a preview of what you're gonna see tomorrow after the race. My victory dance. Uh! You like that? -Oh yeah? -Yeah. Well, I got a victory dance, too. -Where's it at? -Goes a little something like this. That's okay, you like this? Oh, yes. All right, everybody, we open in five minutes. Where's mother nature? Here I am. Oh, Mary Lou, you look stunning. Oh, you know what? I thought this would be silly, but I must say. I do make it work. All right, where are my special waitresses? Sunny and cloudy? Here we are. So. Kind of a bummer having to go to summer school, right? I like summer school. Me too. When I said bummer, I meant bummer! You can't change the meaning of a word by just saying it differently. Bummer. Um. I'll be right back. Hey. How's it going out there, tiger? Terrible. I keep saying the wrong thing. Well. I know how you can win her over without saying a single word. The baby? How is he gonna help me? Once she sees how great you are with Toby. She is guaranteed to melt. Now. Hold him close. Cradle the head. I hope you're better with girls than my older brother. Jade, I don't think you've met my baby brother. This is Toby. Oh my gosh, he's so cute. And you're so good with him. The trick is to cradle the head. Here, have some more rain. That's what we call water. Isn't that fun? Martin, party of four, your table is ready. This is hurricane Harry with a special bulletin. The forecast for the next few minutes is entertaining. Ladies and gentlemen, the musical stylings of. Wentz's weather girls. Hit it. Hurricane Harry's is the spot doo-dah, doo-dah. We serve our dishes cold and hot all the doo-dah day. And night! Wentz's weather girls. And they'll be back to do it again every hour on the hour. I liked it better when I didn't know what my dad did. Think we're dry enough to go in yet? Nope. Still squishing. Hey. What hit us during that last storm? Was that sleet? No. Kid threw a bowl of nachos into the fan. We gotta quit this job. We can't. Your mom would kill me and your dad will be crushed. Well, if he adds an earthquake tomorrow, we might actually be crushed. Wait, we can't quit. But we could get fired. Yeah. Ooh, I don't know what you're thinking, but I like it. Hey, do you mind if we take a break for a second? Why? There's just this thing I do for my baby brother. I share life lessons and give him advice. I call it a video diary. That is the sweetest thing ever. I get that a lot. Hey, Char. Toby. It's your big brother Gabe here with another one of my signature video diary. Anyway, last night after I tucked you in and kissed you in your head. I sang you to sleep with a song. Oh, can you sing it now? Please? Um. Hush, little Toby go to sleep. You're already asleep so stay asleep. La-la-la la-la-la la-la-la. Sleep. Sleepy sleep, sleepy sleep sleep, sleep, sleep. Aw. Well, that's all for now, so, I'll just say. Good. Fortune, Toby. That's sort of my trademark. Now, remember, Charlie. Winning isn't everything. -It's the only thing. -Yes. Yes. Okay, you know that shame you felt for the last two years? It ends today. Or it could get worse depending on how this goes. Okay. The race is to that lamppost and back. First trike to cross the finish line wins. Wins what? -Hey, dad. -What is going on? Nothing. We're just hanging out at the park. Then why have the kids got numbers on them? Because we're teaching them their ones and twos. How many times have we been over this? You cannot race children like horses. Can we race them like dogs? You can't race them at all. All right, kids, come on. Hey, who wants to go the playground. Huh? Okay, come on. Man! I was all fired up for a race today. Yeah, me too. You know, we could still have a race. Where's Toby? Dad took him to the park. What? No, no, Jade's about to leave and I need to make a move. So make your move. I don't have a move. I need Toby. she likes it when I do nice things for him. Gabe, I'm leaving. Wait! Hey. So. Um. Uh. I was just wondering if. You wanted to go to a movie with me sometime? Oh. Um. No, thank you. But I thought you were kinda into me? Yeah, as a friend but. I could never date you. I like bad boys. Wha. but I am a bad boy. I was just kidding about all that baby stuff. Gabe, be proud of who you are. A sweet, sensitive, good boy. No. I'm not. I'm a total jerk, ask anyone. Sweetie-pie. This blanket you knit for the baby is. Absolutely precious. Bye, Gabe. Whoa! Woo! Yes! Yes! Watch this! Well, that brings us to the top of the hour which means it is time To give it up again for wentz's weather girls. You ready to get fired? Hit it. I guess that was a bad idea. We've ruined everything. If you have to make some tough choices, we understand. And I'm talking about firing us. That was. Awesome! My weather girls. We are going to be together forever. Well, what do you know. My boys. Yeah. He woke up from his nap so we're just hanging out. Oh. You know who Toby reminds me of? You. Because he doesn't have a girlfriend? No. Because you both have that sparkle in your eyes. And that's another thing girls like. A sparkle. Thanks, mom. Well, since you're watching toby, you don't, um, mind if I take a nap, do you? Well, I. I guess, but if he. Mom? Hey, Toby. Gabe here. So, I want to tell you everything that I've learned about girls. That's it. Anyway, if you ever need any advice in the future. Wait. what. what are you doing?. Making a video diary for Toby. Wha. that's kind of my thing. Not any more. So. The next time I have a crush on a girl, wish me good furtune, Toby. Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Jealous? What? No. Confused. What does. Good fortune,Toby. Even mean. It means that Toby has the good fortune not to hear Good luck, Charlie. Okay, give me my camera. Good fortune, Toby. Good luck, Charlie. Woo. What a ride. You know, after a workout like that, I don't want some kind of kiddie bubble bath. I'm 12 to 13 now. I want a body spray that works as hard as I do. That's why I use Duude. Duude, when you don't need help from your mommy any more. Duude, from the makers of Guy and Bro.
Chew carefully, I'm missing an earring. Eh, I'll roll the dice. Hey, everybody. I have some big news. - I'm moving out.  - You're what? What do you mean you're moving out? I am moving in with Emmett. His parents promised him an apartment when he turned 18. They had a party for him, gave him a cake and drove him to the new place. All in like 20 minutes. P. J. , I'm not sure about this. Mom, it totally makes sense. I'm about to start Community College and the apartment is right near campus. That is a good point. Blah blah blah. All I'm hearing is that I'm getting my own room. Let's get you packed. Come on. Bob, are you sure PJ's ready to live on his own? Well, he is 18, honey. Oh, it sounds like somebody's experiencing empty-nest syndrome. Well, the good news there is that our nest is still very very full. In fact, the challenge is to avoid having any more little birdies. It just went by so fast. It seems like just yesterday that P. J. was tripping. over his shoelaces and we were wiping his nose. It was yesterday. Today's all burnt toast Running late and Dad jokes. Has anybody seen my left shoe? I close my eyes, take a bite. Grab a ride, laugh out loud. There it is up on the roof. I've been there, I survived. So just take my advice. Hang in there, baby things are crazy. But I know your future's bright. Hang in there, baby there's no maybe. Everything turns out all right. Sure life is up and down. But trust me, it comes back around. You're gonna love who you turn out to be. Hang in there, baby. - Oh, my Mom's here. - Aw. Hello, Teddy. Spence, you ready? I left my coat downstairs. I'll be right back. Would you like to come in? Oh no, that's okay. I'm fine, thanks. So it's been awhile. How have you been? I'm good. Thank you. - And you?  - Good good. So how about that weather? It's like it's not too hot, not too cold. Temperate, you might say. Yes， Temperate. Temperate. Oh, Spencer's back. Yay!. Hey, it wasn't there. I must have left it in the backyard. - I'll just. - No no. You can get it next time. Out you go. - Bye. - Bye, guys. Temperate? What. ?. Bob, would you take Toby upstairs and put him down for his nap? Uh. Up. Up. Upstairs?. That's uh. It's kinda lonely up there, isn't it? Would you take Toby upstairs and put him down for his nap? Hey, you know what? Have him nap right here. Bob, he's six weeks old. Never too early to learn how to couch-nap. Okay, fine. I will take him upstairs. And you better get real comfortable on that couch. - What was that about?  - What? Not wanting to take the baby upstairs. I mean, that's lazy. Even for you. What? I just didn't feel like it. That's all. No, there's something going on with you. Since when did you become so interested in me? Since the cable went out. Man, this place is great. We should really call your Dad and thank him. We can't. Part of the agreement about the new apartment is that I never call. This is so awesome. We can eat whatever we want. Stay up past our bedtime. Dude, there is no bedtime! Yay, we're adults now! Yeah! Dude, I'm gonna go check out the view. Hey, look at this clown. Oh, it's an actual clown. You're not still afraid of clowns, are you? No. You know what the best part  about this place is?  - Huh? Our moms aren't around to tell us what to do. Ah. It's your Mom. Hi, guys! Brought you some lunch. Lunch. Awesome. Except for we don't have any plates Or forks. Hey, why don't you go see if that clown next door has any? I'm on it. Sweetheart, that's not nice. We don't call our neighbors clowns. Well, if I knew his professional name I'd use it. So what do you think of the place? - It's nice! - Yeah. Yeah, it's a little small maybe. Call it cozy. Kinda drafty. We call it inside breezy. That's Emmett's bed and that's mine. Oh, Emmett's a little messy, isn't he? Yeah. Well, that's Emmett. Honey, just because it's Emmett's apartment doesn't mean you should let him walk all over you. If you don't like the mess, say something. Mom, stop worrying, okay? It's gonna be fine. We're grown-ups now. Ugh, it was just so awkward and I kept saying temperate. And I never say temperate. You just said it twice. Does your Mom like me? Hey, of course she likes you. I mean, does your Mom like me? Let's keep it on your Mom. Hey Teddy, look, my Mom likes you, all right? That's just how she is. You know, she's reserved. Well, I want us to have a good relationship. So tell me some stuff about her. Okay, um, what do you want to know? I want to know who is Lynn Walsh? What's her favorite color, her favorite food? Who would play her in the movie of her life? Do you know that stuff about your Mom? Purple, lasagna and Reese Witherspoon. Oh, um. All right, well, there's one thing I can tell you. She likes orchids. - Orchids. - Yeah. Good, okay. So what else? Uh, oh, she likes going to this one fancy place downtown for high tea. Great. Okay, keep going. That's all I got. That's it? Hey look, I think it's pretty great I came up with that. Okay, I just had an awesome idea. I'm gonna take your Mom out to tea and we're gonna talk about orchids. And tea. That's great. I don't have to come to this, do I? I just need you to watch the baby for a sec. Whoa!. No! No! Oh ow! Mmm. Nobody tells Mom! - What are we not telling Mom?  - What? What? Dude, you just yelled nobody tells Mom in your sleep. I mean I'm in, I just want to know what we're not telling her. No. No, I was just dreaming about that time I dropped Charlie. Oh. I remember that day. That was a really good sandwich. Now I'm worried I'm gonna do the same thing to Toby. I can't stop thinking about it. So that's why you didn't want to carry him up the stairs. I don't want to carry him down the stairs either. - What are you gonna do, Dad? - I don't know! But I can't drop Toby like I did Charlie. - You did what? - I did wh. Hey!. Hey hey, Sweetie. No no no no, Daddy didn't drop you. It was more. It. It. It was more like a toss. And then you flew a little! Bad Daddy. But Daddy caught you. Lucky Daddy. Thanks for buying plates and forks, Emmett. Too bad we're having soup. Hey, would you mind picking that up? I will, just let me finish my plate of soup first. - It'll take one second. - I don't have a second. Soup gets cold really fast when it's on a plate. How long does it take to pick up a piece of trash? Okay, well, wait. What's your problem? My problem is my roommate is a slob. - I'm a slob? - You're a slob. - You take that back! - I will not. You know, I hate when you get like this. I'm going to my room. All right, well, I'm going to my room. You better not be looking at me. You better not be looking at me. - Stop it!  - You stop it! - No, you stop it! Turn around. - You. Okay. You want something to look at? Try this. Ha! See, that doesn't bother me. - Now you're the clown. - No, you're the clown. - You're the clown. - You're the clown. You don't think you're a clown? - What me to prove that you're a clown? - Fine! Look at your bed! Yes hi, um. I'm just double-checking a reservation for Duncan? Yes yes, I know I called five minutes ago. It's just. It's a. It's a very important reservation. See, it's with my boyfriend's Mom. Yes, the one who likes orchids. Oh, okay, she's here. Okay, I have to go. I'll. I'll call you from the car. - Hello! - Hello. - Come in, sit. - Oh, love to. You look lovely. So do you. - Shall we? - Sure. - Hey, Mom. - Hey, P. J. what are you doing here?. Oh, Emmett and I had a big fight. Really? That's terrible. Oh, you know what? Gabe put a lock on your bedroom door but I'll get the bolt cutters. No, Mom, Mom, no! Mom, I'm not moving back. We worked it out. - Oh, you did? - Yeah. I got mad because he was messing up the place. He got mad because I got mad. Then we got tired of being mad. He agreed to stop being a slob and we made chocolate toast. Oh. Well, good for you, standing up for yourself. - Mmm. - And I'm sure Emmett will live up to his promise of not being a slob. I mean you know what they say. People change. Or is it that people never change? Doing great, big guy. I don't know if I can do this. - Just keep coming. - No, my knees are wobbling. Yes! Okay, all right. So you made it down with a roast, a ham and a chicken. You wanna try some side dishes? I'm ready to carry a real kid. What are you looking at? - Hi. - Hi! Hi. Okay uh, two questions. Why are you carrying Gabe and. Why does that chicken have a face? Oh, you know why? We're playing a new game. We're playing a new game called uh. Chicken drop. And he who drops the chicken must carry the victor down the stairs. We're still working out the kinks. - May I help you? - Hi. We have a reservation. Duncan, party of two. Sorry, I don't have you down. What? But, um. I confirmed the reservation and then I reconfirmed. And then I reconfirmed the reconfirm. Which is basically just a long way of saying that I put a lot of work into this reservation so I want my table and I want it now! Oh, here it is, Duncan. Shall we? So who are you again? I'm the Window Inspector from the Department of See-through Services. Okay, I've been a building manager for 25 years, and I have never heard of that. Well, you're hearing about it now. All right, let's see what we got here. Oh yeah. P87, single pane. We see a lot of these. Okay, for the final part of my inspection I'm gonna need you to vacate the premises. I can't do that. I take the security of my building very seriously. - I have a candy bar. - Lock up when you're done. P. J. \NP. J. !. Unbelievable! He promised. Oh! Oh, so the clown next door meant the clown next door. So how's your tea? Actually it's a little cold. Well, I can fix that. Um, excuse me, her tea is cold. Could you get her a fresh cup? And make sure it's hot, like piping hot. I hear that you like orchids. I used to and then my Mother passed away. Orchids were her favorite too. And now I can't even look at one without crying. Oh my gosh. Are you okay? Yes. Oh, my hand fell asleep. Darn it. Thank you. - Ah ah! - What, what's wrong? I burned my tongue. Ice ice! We need ice! Ah, ice. Is that helping? I'm stuck. You're what? I'm stuck! You're a duck? Could you sound it out? How is everything over here? Well, Mom, I'm moving back home. Oh no. It's such sad, unexpected news. I came back home today and the place was a mess. What was it? Unmade bed? Potato chips everywhere? How do you know about the chips? I don't. Man. And after he promised me he was going to keep the place clean. I'm never talking to that guy again. Hey, once you get over this, you guys will be best friends again. I don't think so. I mean, really I could have dealt with the mess. But he looked me right in the eye and said he didn't do it. Best friends don't lie to each other. I'm gonna go put my stuff away. P. J. , wait. Emmett didn't mess up your apartment. I did. What? Why would you do that? Because I thought you weren't ready to live on your own. And. The truth is. I'm the one who's not ready. But, Mom, I'm 18. I'm an adult now. But you're still my little boy. You'll always be my little boy. You're a good Mom. I know. A good Mom who broke into my apartment and trashed it. I know. How you feeling, Dad? Good good. - Yeah! - Yes, I did it! - I did it! - Nice! What were you so worried about? I don't know. It was a piece of cake. - Where are you going? - To get a piece of cake. A guy's gotta celebrate. Oh hey, thank you. So much for getting me through this. You real. No! No! Hey, honey. You dropped the baby again, didn't you, Bob? What? Well, Charlie, um, I went to tea with Spencer's Mom. And we had so much fun. We decided to keep that party going. In the emergency room. Yeah, I don't think Mrs. Walsh will be talking to me anytime soon. Or to anyone. What. Dad, what are you doing? Taking Toby for a walk. That doesn't really look like a walk. No, it will be eventually. Well, don't you need the diaper bag? Aw, man! Well, you survived him for three years, all you need is 15 more. Good luck, Charlie. Hi, Bob Duncan here with another amazing product that is going to make your life easier. You have stairs, do you have a baby? Well, how many times has this happened to you? Whoa!

Hey, Dad. How was your day? Do you really want to know? Actually, I was just being polite. It was horrible! Oh, good. So you're gonna tell me anyway. Toby kept me awake all night, so I was a zombie all day. You know, I was so tired I used termite spray on a nest full of rats. Well. You'll uh. You'll kill them tomorrow, huh, Dad? I never know what to say. Oh, no. You know what? I think I'm just gonna lay down right here. Oh yeah. Toby, come on. Work with me here. Please? Help a mother out. Guess who missed his nap? And guess who took an extra long one? Check it out. I just joined the marching band. Gabe! Gabe! Gabe! - What?  - Take it outside. No, Mrs. Dabney just told me to take it inside. Honey? Honey? Here's some mail for PJ. Maybe you could take it to his apartment tomorrow? - How about if I do it now?  - Okay. This is so great. Hang on. I'll get my baton. Today's all burnt toast Running late and Dad jokes. Has anybody seen my left shoe? I close my eyes, take a bite. Grab a ride, laugh out loud There it is up on the roof. I've been there, I survived. So just take my advice. Hang in there, baby Things are crazy But I know your future's bright. Hang in there, baby There's no maybe Everything turns out all right. Sure life is up and down. But trust me, it comes back around. You're gonna love who you turn out to be. Hang in there, baby. Hey, thanks for coming to my volleyball game. Oh yeah. My pleasure. Getting to see all those cute guys running around in tight shirts and shorts. But mostly you. I focused on you. Well, it was an awesome game. I'm telling you, the team's really coming together this year. Yeah? Yeah, it must be really fun to be a part of a team. You know what's kind of sad? This is my last year of high school and I've never played a sport. Oh well. You know what? I'll join the girls' volleyball team. You're gonna play volleyball? Look, it's not that easy. Well, how hard could it be? You do it. It's very difficult, all right? I just make it look easy. Kind of like being your boyfriend. Oh oh oh! Oh, yes! All day long! I got it. - Hey. - Hey, Dad. Welcome to Casa De PJ and Emmett. What? Wait, I thought we were calling it Emmett and PJ's World O' Fun? So, what brings you to our place to be named later? I brought you some mail. Hey! You got chairs. Oh, yeah. Quite the change from Casa De Drums and Screaming Kids. Oh, let's go with World O' Fun, they're already using Casa De. You know, it's not always this quiet here, Mr. Duncan. We're right next door to a fire station, so we get a lot of sirens. So, does a siren go off every hour of the night because it's hungry? Does a siren need to be burped and changed? You don't know a lot about sirens, do you? Well, Dad, um, thanks for stopping by. It, uh. Dad? I think he's asleep. And he's sitting on the remote. How are we gonna change the channel? - I got an idea.  - What's that? Uh. - It worked. - Okay. - Wait, wait, wait, go back. - Oh um. - Ah. - Perfect. Okay. Now how are we gonna turn up the volume? - Volume's fine. - Yup. Hey, Mom? I need some help with my science project. Where's Dad? Uh, hello? Why don't you want my help? Come on, Gabe. I'm great at science. And it sounds like fun. Helping me with a science project sounds fun? I'm covered in spit-up. Work with me, here. All right. I'll give you a shot. Great. And just so we're clear, I'm not gonna let you trick me into doing all the work like you do with Dad. For your information, Dad enjoys being tricked. It's part of the dance we do. All right, what's the project? Building a model rocket to launch at the science fair. Ooh. Fun. - When's it due?  - Two days. Two days?! Why did you wait until the last minute? Well, that's when Dad does his best work. That's true. Listen up, everybody. I want you to meet the newest member of our team. - Hi, everybody. I'm Teddy. - Wrong. No, I'm pretty sure. Teddy's too soft. It's too nice. From now on, your volleyball name is uh. T-Rex! Keep stretching. I'm gonna get a fresh whistle. Coach likes to give us all fierce dinosaur nicknames that go with the first letter of our name. I'm Vonnie, so I'm Velociraptor, Stephanie's stegosaurus, Taylor's pterodactyl. But pterodactyl begins with a P. Tell it to the coach. He loves to be corrected. All right, let's get to work. I'm sorry, I thought you were gonna get that. Way to go. Nice shot. That was awesome. Oh, are you okay? That was mine, wasn't it? That's it. Practice is over. Except for you, T-Rex. I want to talk to you in private. You stink. Coach, I don't think we're in private yet. And do you know why you stink? No. When I ask a question, I don't want an answer, do you understand me? I don't know what to do. You're too nice. Nice people, they get pushed around. And I'm not talking about volleyball, I'm talking about life. - It's just my first day. - And possibly your last. Now, if you want to stay on my team, you need to come back tomorrow and play with some fire. - You got it?  - Got it. Oh, and one more thing. Pterodactyl actually starts with a P. I know that it's kind of confusing, but it's. Get out of here! See? Isn't this nice? Working on a project together. Nice? It's great. It doesn't even feel like homework. It's more like home play, or home joy, or Too much? Okay. Hey, Charlie. What do you want? Oh. I forgot, I totally promised Charlie I was gonna play with her. Charlie, I'm sorry I can't play with you. Look, I know you've been feeling neglected ever since Toby came along, but I'm working on a big school project with Mom. Oh, you know, go play with her for a few minutes. I'll just get this started. If you say so. Where's my toy? - Just like we talked about. - Thank you. All right, now, let's head down to the basement where you're gonna play sit quietly, while I play watch TV. And then he said that I stink because I'm too nice. - You know this is all your fault.  - How is it my fault? You're the one who wanted to join a team. Well, you could have mentioned that the coach was a lunatic. You know what? I don't need this. I'm gonna quit. Well, I thought you wanted to play a sport. Yeah, well there's plenty of other sports out there. I'll do the one with the, um With the the ball and the stick and the helmet. Okay, so that would be either Softball, Field Hockey, or Lacrosse. - Which one's outdoors?  - All of them are. - Which one has the cutest uniforms?  - None of them do. Sports is so hard. - Gentlemen. - Hey, Dad. - What are you doing here?  - Again? Oh, I, uh. Brought you a little housewarming gift. Vacuum bags. That will come in handy once we get a vacuum. Well, Dad, it was nice of you to Take off your coat and stay. I also brought. This awesome Japanese monster movie. Your Mom hates it when I watch these at home. Put it in the thing. Um. You know, actually, Dad, we're kind of busy. That's all right. Don't worry about it. You're not gonna bother me. Just another peaceful day in Tokyo, huh? Oh, that's gonna change. Teddy? Why are you getting home from work so late? Well, I had a very stressful day at the library. One of the patrons was talking, and I was gonna say something, but I didn't want to be mean. Then my boss got mad at me, so I hid in the stacks and cried. Teddy, you gotta stop letting people walk all over you. - Yeah. - What are you standing there for? - Get in the kitchen and make dinner. - Yes, Sir. Get the door first. - Mr. Hammerstone? - Look at you. Because you quit the team, people walked all over you the rest of your life. I told you so. I told you so. I told you so. Can I use your bathroom? - Sure. - I told you so. That's it. I am done being nice. Aw. No! Hey, honey. How'd you sleep? Lousy. And if that doesn't sound nice, then too bad. Well, someone's in a mood. Got a problem with that? Um, Teddy? Sweetheart, um, are you okay? Because you just seem, I don't know, completely different? What? Do you want some of this? Come again? Well, you know whether or not you want it. I'm not going to give it to you. That's what I thought. Gabe, honey? I'm gonna say something to you I have never said before. Right now, you're my favorite. Feels good. Don't get used to it. - Hey. - Dad. How did you get in here? Locksmith let me in. He let you into our apartment without our permission? Locksmiths and exterminators are brothers. Yeah, we're like cops and firefighters. Just a little less heroic. Hey, you know what? I got you a present. And you're welcome. A vacuum cleaner. Yay. Uh, so. Dad, um, how much longer are you. Oh. Wait. Pizza's ready. - You've gotta get rid of him. - Don't worry. He. He won't stay long. You know what? I was thinking about getting you guys a sofa bed. You know, so that when I'm here late and you want me to stay over? Now. Got an idea. So, he likes it here because it's quiet, right? - Right. - Watch this. - Hey, Dad? - Yeah? Mind if I take the new vacuum for a little test run? Go ahead. Okay. Just my luck. The shush vac. Um, PJ? What are you doing? What? PJ? PJ\NP. PJ. PJ\NPJ! Yes, Dad? What are you doing? Well, I just don't feel like I'm cleaning unless I hear that sound. Is. Is that bothering you?. No. Still quieter than home. Ah. Mom. What did you do to my rocket? Well, uh, first, I built it. And then I made it purty. Feathers? Why'd you have to add feathers? Oh, that was Charlie's special touch. We also named it. Say hello. To Rainbow Sunshine. I can't take that to school. Well, I guess you could always redecorate it yourself. You mean. Work on my own project? Has it really come to that? I'm afraid so. It was a good run. Duncan. I didn't think you'd come back. Did you sleep on what I said? Oh, I slept on it, dreamt it, chewed it up, and spit it out. All right, Dinos, listen up. We're gonna scrimmage the boys' team today. Yeah! Whatever scrimmage means, bring it! Thought you were quitting. What? You're trying to get in my head? Or you afraid to lose to a bunch of girls? You trash talk your boyfriend? I'm so gonna do that as soon as I learn how to trash talk. - And get a boyfriend. - Oh yeah. Got lucky, punks. Oh, sweetums! Oh. I think you broke my nose. T-Rex, let me get in there. Oh! Oh, my nose! She broke my nose too. Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't. It was an accident. They were both accidents. Sweet mother, I created a monster! No. Guys, come on. I'm not a monster. I'm not a monster. Does anyone know when Field Hockey try-outs are? All right. All right. All right, I'm done! Come on. - Wow. - What do you think? You ruined it. Rainbow Sunshine is now. Black Night Doom Missile Terror Fireball. All right, let's do a test launch. Okay, whoa. Before you do, I've prepared a few words. Oh boy. From the beginning of time, man looked to the heavens and said. 'Stupid birds! How come they get to fly and we don't?' - I'm pushing the button. - No, no, no! I haven't gotten to my favorite part. Wait, wait, wait. Three, two, one. Blast off. Yeah, that's some fireball. - Hey. - Hey. What are you doing out here? Uh, we need to talk. Okay, but can we do it over at your place? Because I'm way more comfortable over there. Actually. Actually, let's do it here. Okay? Okay. Wow, this is really hard. I. Don't really know how to do this. Well, PJ, if it's hard to say, just say it fast. It's like. Like tearing off a bandage. All right. Here goes. Idon'twantyoutohangoutatmyplacesomuch. You might want to tear that a little slower. I. - Don't. - Little little. Little faster. I don't want you to hang out at my place so much. Look, I'm sorry, Dad, but I moved out of the house so I could be on my own. Kind of hard to do that when you're always there. I see. You mad at me? No. - Okay. - No. No, come on, you're absolutely right. It's your place. You don't want your old man hanging out there all the time. No, I do not. I mean. I mean. Thanks for understanding. Oh, I'm gonna miss your place. Because let me tell you something. Around here? It always feels like there's something crazy going on. Oh. Mom, I think I found the problem. Loose wires. Well dude. Stick em together. - Was that a rocket? - Yup. Come over any time, Dad. - How about now? - Let's go. Hey, Charlie. So, big news. Looks like I'm staying on the volleyball team. You know, after they make a few minor repairs to the gym. Speaking of minor repairs. So this is what happens if you let Mom help you with a school project. Okay, it was not my fault. Really? Because Gabe said you uttered the words. Dude, stick em together. I don't recall exactly what I uttered. Okay. Well, consider yourself warned. If you ever allow Mom to help you with a science project. Good luck, Charlie. Fly, rocket. Fly high. Hey, hon. Bob? What are you doing here? Oh, PJ and Emmett kicked me out. So I'm just looking for a little peace and quiet. Well, you're crowding me. Get lost. I'm crowding you? In outer space?

Hello, Teddy. Why'd you want to see me? Well, I was saddened to hear that you and Victoria broke up. She said I wasn't romantic enough. Which is totally untrue. I did an algorithm which proved my romanticism is above average. Anyway, um Since you and Victoria are no longer together I Uh, stop. Before you get your hopes up, I'm not ready to start another relationship. It's too soon. Really? Okay, um Give me a moment to regroup Done. Anyways, um I was wondering if you actually wanted to be my partner for the student U. N. Ah, so you'd like to win the award you lose every year. Well, that's not all of it. Because the award will look good on your college applications, and help you get into a better school. Yeah. That's all of it. Attention everyone. I'm back! Yeah! Thank you, thank you, thank you. You guys can go pick up that corpse now. Oh! Karen. Hello, Duncan. Hi. I thought you gave up nursing after you got married. Yeah, well, I'm not married any more. He said I was loud and bossy, I think he has commitment issues. Well, it's, uh Nice to see you again. Is it, Duncan? Is it? Because I remember what happened the last time we were in this room together. Do you? I believe I resigned due to a temporary misunderstanding. You popped one of these saline bags and squirted it in my face! Tomato, to-mah-to. I'm keeping my eye on you, Duncan. I've had a lot of problems with nurses returning from maternity leave. You're not gonna be all like wah wah wah I miss my baby. Are you? Of course not. Good. I'm gonna be all wah wah wah I can't believe I have to work with you again. Now, here is our presentation. And since we're Italy, I decided to draw a nice little map of our nation on the cover. Oh, good. That's Italy. I was afraid you were drawing some boots that you wanted. Look, I don't draw boots. I'm not that shallow. Okay. All right. Let's go. Why are you taking the baby? Don't worry. My Dad's gonna meet me at school and we're gonna do a hand off. Like in football. Anyway, it'll be fine. Toby's such a sweet little boy, we won't even know he's there. Hush little baby don't say a word. Why are you singing? The child is obviously in distress. Papa's gonna buy you a mockingbird. See? Amazing. Lullabies were forbidden in my house. My mother would only allow me to listen to 18th century Italian operas. Oh, so that's why you turned out to be The way that you are. You've been arrested by a Sheriff Kitty. Go to the dog pound. I don't get it. The game's called puppy town. But the Sheriff's a cat? Okay. Ah. You win again, Charlie. The 10th straight time. - Play again? -No no no no no no. No more puppy town. I'm all I'm all puppied out. Let's do something else. Want to read a book? Okay. Return to puppy town. My phone's upstairs. Hang on. Gabe? It's your turn to watch Charlie. Just a minute! What'd you say? Eh. Charlie? Did you run away? Because if you did, I don't blame you. Want to play? Oh, puppy town, huh? I used to play with my son Rodney. I have to warn you, I'm pretty good. Me too. Okay, hotshot. And this is my baby, Toby. Isn't he adorable? Oh, you know what would be adorable? Doing your job! You don't see me going around showing everyone pictures of my plant. A plant. How wise of you to get something that can't run away. Note to self: Take picture of plant, make people look at it. Okay, I'm just going to check your blood pressure, Mr. Franklin. You can call me Toby. Oh, Toby. That's my baby's name. Well, what do you know about that. Today's my first day back at work, and I just miss him so much. Oh, Toby. - You're hurting me. -Oh, no, sweetie. I would never hurt you. Mama loves you. Hey, I can't feel my arm. What? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Franklin. I'm just having a little trouble focusing today. That's okay, dear. You work in a hospital, no need to focus on your job. Thank you for understanding. What you reading? Return to puppy town. You know, I can't get past Sheriff Kitty. I mean, why would dogs obey a cat? Thank you. Okay. So, where's Charlie? That's funny. I'll do it. So, where's Charlie? I thought she was with you. I thought she was with you. Dude, why are you laughing? Because you're pretending you don't know where Charlie is. I don't know where Charlie is! What? -This is suddenly not funny.  -You think? We got to find her. Uh, Charlie? - Charlie?  -Charlie? Hey, guys. Hey, Dad. What are you doing? Uh Playing hide-and-go-seek with Charlie. Yeah. She's very good. - You want to help us look?  - She could be anywhere in the house. Or outside. -The rules were kind of vague. -Yeah. Oh, hey. Here's an idea. Why don't you guys go next door  and look in Mrs. Dabney's house. Do you want to know why I think you should go over and look there? Because you're not very good at this game? No, because Mrs. Dabney called me an hour ago to tell me that Charlie had gone over there. All by herself. Oh. So A little moment of panic, but a happy ending, huh, Dad? Go get her. Oh, and when you guys come back we're having a little talk. Sheriff Kitty? Well, that doesn't make any sense. - Victor. -Victoria. This is who you're partnered with? Teddy Duncan? She's academically inferior. She's not inferior, she's marginal. Sitting right here, guys. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to lead Norway to victory. Of course she would be Norway. Cold, isolated, yet irresistible. Dad, where are you? What? Oh, man. Okay. Yeah, okay. Just get here as fast as you can. Okay, bye. Bad news. Um, my Dad is running late, so we're kind of stuck with the baby for a little while. What? We can't give our presentation with a baby. Okay, relax. No one will even know he's here. Yeah, unless they have a sense of smell. Man, Toby. Again? All right, let me change you. Really? Right here? This is highly inappro Victor, are you okay? Fine. Just gonna stay down here for a minute. Probably not a good idea. Welcome to the 14th annual, South High student united nations competition. As I always say at this juncture Game on. Yes, the chair recognizes the delegate from Norway. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to protest the fact that the Italian delegation appears to consist of three people. The maximum allowed is two. Italy, care to rebut? Um, the third person is a baby. A baby is a human being. Italy has admitted to breaking the rules and should be dismissed from the proceedings. Isn't she magnificent? Mr. Chairman, Italy is involved in some family care issues, Italy's father promised to be here, but as we can see he has failed to cross the border. The chair understands Having dealt with Italy's parents before. Double sixes? You win again. Set em up. This isn't over. Well, it only took you 73 minutes to realize your little sister was missing. In our defense You got anything? - Nope. -Oh. Charlie, there you are. Oh, playing puppy town, huh? - How you doing? - It's about even. No, it's not. - I let her win. -She said bad words. Just take her and get out. Dr. Elliot to ICU. Dr. Elliot to ICU. Mommy, I see you. Mommy, I see you. Charlie? Charlie, is that you? Who are you talking to? Um, no one. Dr. Napier's looking for you. Oh, and tomorrow, you're working a double. Good for you, Karen. Way to take the reins. Dr. Napier, you wanted to see me? Yes, I want you to come home, mommy. Uh, excuse me? I miss you, mommy. You do? Can I have a hug? Of course you can. Ohh. What are you doing, Duncan? And that is why Norway believes that the most important problem facing the world today is debt. Thank you. We will now hear from the Italian delegation. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Italy believes the most important issue facing the world today is the environment. Just keep going. As I was saying Do something. Make him be quiet. Only singing will do that. What are we supposed to do, sing the presentation? Italy, we're waiting. Yeah, that's a great idea. Just sing it. - But I -Sing. The snow caps are melting. From all the pollution. Our alps, they need helping. There is a solution. We will go, we will go, we will go. To hand our resolution in. So You will know, you will know, you will know. It's a fight, we truly can win. All right, I just put Charlie down for her nap, so let's talk. How could you two be so irresponsible? Dad, before we get into that, we made you a little something. Oh, sweet Mama, is that a chicken Bob-pie? Mm-hmm. Stuffed with cheddar cheese, mini hot dogs, and onion rings. And love. No. No. Look, guys, bribery is not gonna work. I'm very disappointed in you two. Now, I can't do everything around here. I was supposed to be over at the high school to pick up Toby, but now I gotta deal with this. We're sorry, Dad. I just can't believe you would let Charlie walk right out that door. Dad, we won't let it happen again. Good. Now if we're done, I believe there was a pie mentioned. And now the exciting moment that we've all been waiting for The winner of the 14th annual South High student U. N. competition is. Oh, my goodness. Italy. Yes! We won! Victor? I didn't know you could sing like that. It was so romantic. Does this mean you want me back? - Is 64 the square root of  -4,096? Oh, darling. Congratulations, Italy. Wow, um You know, I'd like to thank the little people. And by little people, I mean Toby. Love you, bro. Hey, guys. Hey, mom. What are you doing home from work so early? Oh, I had a terrible day. I kept having these crazy hallucinations about Toby and Charlie. In fact, they're still going on. I thought I just saw Charlie in Mrs. Dabney's window. Well, that's crazy. Mommy! Does anyone else see her? She got out again. Some operation you're running here. But They lost her first! - What?!  -He ate three pies. - Yeah!  -Because you made them for me. Quiet everybody! Pie boy, in the kitchen now! And you two watch your sister. Honey honey honey, okay, look. I can explain. I know it looks bad. Bob, I missed the kids so much today. Going back to work is so much harder than I thought. Honey, it's just the first day. It's gonna get better. I don't know. Bob, we have two little ones now, and they both need me so much. I just Look, I know we need the money, but if there's a way I could stay home Okay, all right all right, look, if this is what's best for the family. Then we'll We'll find a way. Oh, Bob. Okay.

Do I have time to put on my goggles? I recently bought goggles because I had a feeling. Nope. Whoa! Oh! Oh no! Ohh Good for you, Amy. Good for you.

She's new at our school. Okay, so because she doesn't know you, she agreed to go out with you. - Exactly. - Yeah. Okay. So, here's the plan. You pick us up, you take us to the theater, and you sit as far away from us as possible. Questions? Can I speak to her? Uh, yes. I have taken the liberty of preparing some small talk for you. Hello. I'm Bob. Good-bye. You know, now that I'm hearing it out loud We may not need I'm Bob. Hey, Emmett. How's the road trip to Death Valley? You ran out of gas? That can't be good. Vultures? That can't be good. Emmett. Dude, Emmett. You're not gonna believe this. I think the clown moved out because there's a really cute girl in that apartment. Well, you can't call dibs! We're not even sure if you're coming back. Sorry, dude. I'm making my move. Yeah. Up, and down. Up, and down. Up And down. I hear this movie is pretty good. Yeah, me too. Yeah, me too?

I think that's my kid she's on the date with. - Bob Duncan. - Randy Schleebee, how you doing? I'm good. Have some popcorn. Hmm? Thanks. Have all the popcorn. Whoa. Salty. Yuck. Root beer. My bad. Oh, it's starting. Man, I can't believe we lost again. What do you think the problem is? The other team scored more points than us. - Um, I have an idea. - Mm! Nope. Mom, remember we made an agreement. As team mom, you can only answer questions about snacks and schedules. We even put this in writing. Well, if she gives advice as awesomely as she slices oranges, maybe she's got something. I like this girl. Okay, ladies. Listen up. I've got a story for you. Oh, just so long as it's not one of your college stories. - When I was in college - Here we go. I played hockey for the Southwest Denver Community College Lady Icers. We'd lost 10 games in a row. But all that was about to change the night that we played our arch rival, the Northeast Pueblo Community College Lady Checkers. This is time you're never gonna get back. Now, because of a terrible blizzard, we had to stay in a motel. Best thing that ever happened to us. We all got to know each other and we really bonded. And you know what happened at the next game? No, but I'm on the edge of my seat. One of their players tripped me from behind And our entire team jumped that girl and cross-checked the daylights out of her. Ba-bam! It was so touching. To recap, your advice is that we attack someone? Well, not at first. No no no. I'm saying that you invite the team over for a slumber party. - So you guys can all bond. - I love parties. And I just got a new sleeping bag! Okay, you are way too perky. Looks like we're having a sleepover. Yes, in my new sleeping bag! Seriously, just dial it down. - What a day. - What a day. - She sat so close. - He sat so close. - Our hands touched. - Our hands touched! Wait, what are you talking about? Emma's dad. What a total nightmare. I never want to see him again. Dad, who says you have to? Just because I'm hanging out with Emma doesn't mean that, you have to do stuff with her dad. Really? I don't think Randy feels the same way. What do you mean? Because he wrote his phone number on my hand. Home. And cell. Hey. - I'm Molly. - I'm PJ. Welcome to the neighborhood. I didn't know I was living across from a doctor. Oh, you are? I was talking about you. I saw your coat. Oh. Oh, you think It's so impressive that someone so young could be a doctor. I've worked really hard. So what's your specialty? My specialty? I uh Make people smell better. Oh, so you're an ear, nose, and throat guy? Mostly nose. I'd say it's 50% nose, 30% ear, 30% throat. That's 110%. That's just how much I give. So what do you do, Molly? Oh, uh, I'm a college student. Well, it was nice meeting you, PJ. You know, actually Um. I, uh I'm cooking dinner tonight if you want to come over. The diagnosis is meatloaf. Hey, girls. How's the bonding going? Okay. I see what the problem is. Put your phones in the basket. Good. Dump it. In. Aw, man. Teddy. Vonnie, you too. - What if my boyfriend calls? - You have a boyfriend now? Here. Okay, girls. Forget about your phones. Okay, everybody. We're gonna do a bonding exercise. Now get up, get over there, form a circle. Let's go. Hustle, hustle. Get a move on. Okay. Reach in the circle and grab two hands. Now the goal here is to untie the knot without letting go. It's very difficult, but if you work together, you'll see how easy it is. Go. - Ow. Ow. - Turn this way. - No, the other way! - Ow. Ow, watch it! Get your butt out of my face! Get your face out of my butt. You girls have got to learn to work together. Okay, I need a volunteer. Teddy. Everyone form a circle around Teddy. Come on. Now, you're going to close your eyes and make your body stiff and straight. And then you're going to lean into the circle. Now, you're gonna feel like you're falling, but you're not because your teammates are going to keep you upright. There we go. Now we're working together. Good. How you doing, Teddy? - You know, actually pretty good. - Good. Aah! I have to have a phone, I'm a mom. Hi, Gabe. Emma. I was just wondering if you wanted to go out for ice cream. - Sure.  - Why not make it a foursome? Hey. Hey, you know where I live now. Come on, Bobbo. We had so much fun this afternoon it'd be a crime not to keep the party going. Yeah Oh, whoa. Come on, Gabe. A little help? You smell like flowers. Oh, you You know what? What am I thinking? I can't go anywhere, I got two little ones I gotta take care of. I hear you, Bobsled. That's a cry for help. So I'm staying right here with you. Maybe we can just have ice cream here. Looks like the party's staying home, Bobcat. As you can tell, I've been thinking of some nicknames for you. So you think of some names for me. Oh, I am. Okay, we are going to do another bonding exercise. Everyone find a partner. Okay, good. Now I want each of you to tell your partner one thing you like about her And one thing you don't. By the end of this, we're all gonna be very close. Oh yeah? Yeah, my head's too big? Well, your head is too small! I am not over dramatic! She said over dramatically. Oh, wait a sec. My bad. This is actually really funny. Um, this is not a bonding exercise. No. We did this in my acting class to break down our emotions. I feel so worthless! Well, as you can see, it's very effective. You know what, Vonnie? You're even meaner than Coach Hammerstone! Oh, please. Nobody's meaner than that diphthong. - Yeah, the worst. - I hate him. - We don't like the coach?  - Hate him. And I like everybody. Well Well, that's it. The best thing any team can bond over A common enemy. Grab your coats. Wait. What about the slumber party? Oh, don't worry. After we humiliate the coach, we'll all come back here and get in our jammies. If there's one thing I've learned from all my years of doctoring It's that sticks and stones can break your bones. - Good to know. - Mm-hmm. You know who used to live in your apartment, Molly? A clown. Oh, right. Patches. I'm subletting from him. He's working on a cruise ship. Boats and clowns. Ugh, two of my biggest fears. Actually my biggest fear Would be a boat full of spiders Driven by a clown. Okay. So, shall we retire to the Over there? Hey, can I ask you something? Sure. I fell off my bike and scraped my elbow. I think it might be infected. - Would you take a look?  - Oh, um. I'm ear, nose, and throat. You need more of a wrist, elbow, armpit guy. Still. You are a doctor, right? Got me there. Okay. Let's take a look. Ewe ewe ewe ewe ewe ewe ewe! That's disgusting. - Is it infected?  - It's something. Cover it up! Oh! Ohh. Oh, I would rather be on the spider clown boat right now. PJ\NPJ? You're not really a doctor, are you? No. I'm not. I Spray cologne at Bimbel's Department store. Why did you lie? Because you seemed so impressed by all the doctor stuff. I didn't think you'd like me if you knew what I really do. I'm sorry. Well Actually I wasn't completely honest with you either. What do you mean? I'm not really a student. What are you? This is a surprise. I don't usually tell people on the first date, but it kind of came up naturally. Okay okay okay. I just need some time to get used to this. PJ, a lot of people are afraid of clowns, but I can help you get over that. Okay okay okay. Um We'll start tomorrow. Take that, Hammerstone! - Whoa. - Yes. Yeah, taste my two-ply fury! - Great shot, Vonnie. You rock!  - Yeah! Keep firing, girls. Five bucks if anyone can get it down the chimney. Look at this. We're really coming together as a team. Your idea actually worked. Well, of course it worked. Why are you surprised? I don't know, maybe I've been influenced by the last, 50 ideas that went so horribly wrong. Well, maybe in the future you'll give your old mom some credit. She knows what she's doing. Mrs. Duncan? Why does Coach Hammerstone's welcome mat say The Johnsons? Huh? Is is 306 North Birchwood, right? This is 306 South Birchwood. Bummer. Run! Aah! Whoever doesn't get arrested, meet me at 306 North Birchwood! Wait wait wait. Don't answer that. Gabe, it's Emma. Are you home? It's a trick. I know he's out there. I'm not here. Emma. And the Rand-man. I didn't want to say anything so I could trick your dad. So, where is the Ka-Bobster? Um He's not home. Yes, he is. Uh, no. No he's not. She falls apart every time he leaves so we try to keep her out of the loop. He's in there. Oh, I love this guy. Always playing games. - Gotcha!  - Hey. So, want to sit down? Sure. Isn't it great that our dads are best friends? Yeah, about that. Um The truth is My dad isn't crazy about your dad. What? What's wrong with my dad? For one thing, he's kind of loud. He's outgoing. He makes up a bunch of stupid nicknames. Ka-Bobster? That's hilarious. I mean, he licks his fingers and eats other people's food. Yeah. I've got nothing for that one. You know, your dad's not exactly perfect. He's grumpy, and messy, and says stupid things Whoa whoa whoa. My dad's not the problem. Yours is. I mean, yeah. My dad is a problem, but not this problem. Well, I can't believe you're saying bad things about my dad. Daddy? Let's go! - What's wrong, honey?  - I want to go. Gabe's a jerk. Oh Oh yeah? Well You don't smell like flowers any more! Good one. Wasn't it? Wow. This is a shock. Hey, I guess this is it for us, too, huh? Just because the kids aren't seeing each other doesn't mean that we can't. Hey, I got a great idea. Let's go camping. Hey, I got a better idea. What is it? Well, Charlie. Um, once again mom interfered with one of my activities, but this time she actually helped. Yeah, thanks to her, the team really bonded. And, uh, we'll have a chance to bond even more at our court-ordered community service. Hello? Who? Bob-a-lama-ding-dong? - I'm not here.  - Oh, yes you are! Well, it looks like Bob-a-lama-ding-dong has a new friend. Ooh. Wish him good luck, Charlie. Teddy, honey, it's not true. Those girls were just being mean. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. You do not have a big head. You're not just saying that? No. No. Lots of families have to have their doors widened. It's just that lately I've been feeling Like it's Bigger than usual. Well, that's because You've been spending too much time with your brothers. Hey, guys. What's going on? What you looking at?

I can use the eggs for breakfast and the shaving cream for Ah, bup bup bup bup bup! My legs. I'm sorry. Do you not know what bup bup bup bup means? Listen, while I'm here, I need to ask you something else. Can you ride with me to my ladies' club meeting Wednesday night so I can use the carpool lane? - I'll pay you.  - How much? And do we have to talk to each other? 30 bucks and what do you think? See you Wednesday. Are you ready? I am ready. Good day, mate. My name's Kangar-Amy. And these are my little joeys, Charlie and Toby. A family of kangaroos. That's cute. Cute? It took us two hours to get into these costumes, and all we get is cute? No worries, mate. Throw another shrimp on the barbie. Shut up, Bob. Go ahead, Charlie. Tell him what we practiced. I wanna be a Princess. Everybody wants to be a Princess. That's why you're a kangaroo. What she was supposed to say was hoppy Halloween! Where's your costume? - Uh I'm wearing it. - Those are your work clothes. Yeah! No, I'm a I'm going as an exterminator this year. An exterminator? Okay, I am sweating my marsupial butt off in here and that's the best you came up with? All right. Well, hang on. I'm not done. I'm not done. You know what?. Huh? There. I'm a superhero exterminator. I'm Captain Extermo. Who's your sidekick? Pesticide Pete? Mommy, this candy's yucky. What? Uncle Milt's Honey Globs. Why did you buy this disgusting candy? It's not disgusting. It was on sale. Ingredients: Honey Glob. Bob, go get some better candy. UhBob's not here right now. I'm Captain Extermo. Okay. Well, when you see Bob could you tell him I'd like to speak with him? Uh Who would like to speak to him? Kangar-Amy or Amy? Amy. Ooh, he may be gone for a while. Happy anniversary! Surprise! I took you to Paris. Bonjour. Welcome to Chez PeJhay. What? Chez PeJhay. Chez P. J. Oh! Stupid tourists. So I decorated the place and P. J. Is going to cook us an authentic French meal. Although, we didn't discuss the accent. To cook French, you must be French. Your table. Tadah! Um, I think tadah is more magician than French. Your table. Voila! Your menus for the evening. There's only one thing on it. An excellent choice. And now, the music. Hey! Emmett's here. Another thing we didn't discuss. When you play the accordion, you never turn down a gig. Huh. A room full of old ladies on Halloween night. And suddenly I'm not cool again. So how long is this gonna take? Just until I get my award. You're getting an award? Yes, for being the volunteer of the year. It's for my work with troubled kids. But you hate kids. But I do like awards. And I may have mentioned that I would bring one of the troubled kids with me tonight. Wait a minute. Something doesn't smell right here, and it's not just the old ladies. You brought me here just so you could get a stupid award! Happy Halloween! You've been tricked and it's my treat. You take this one. Trick or treat! Hey! All right. There you go. Hey, that is one cool costume. I'm thinking wolf spider? Yeah. I'm really into bugs. Yeah? Me too. Check it out. I'm Captain Extermo. A superhero exterminator?! Awesome! Can I get a picture with you? Yeah! Sure. Honey, you wanna come over here? Somebody wants a picture with Captain Extermo. What? What are you supposed to be? A dog that ate another dog? I'm a kangaroo. And this is my joey. Just take the picture. May I present the first course? Sweetbreads. Tadah! I looked it up. Tadah is acceptable. Mm. Bread and sweets. Two of my favorite things. Neither one of which is in my mouth right now. - Garcon? - Oui? What exactly are in these sweetbreads? Ah! Uh, you have pancreas. nd the gentleman has stomach lining. Bon Appetit. Emmett. - Do you want any sweetbreads? - No, but I know who might. It's like they haven't had pancreas in weeks. You know what, Teddy? This is really nice. Well, it was as close as I could get to a trip to Paris. Plus, I thought it would be perfect considering where we first met. Oh, yeah. Of course. Yeah, I'll never forget it. We were in French class and I dropped my pen and then you said Hey, a pen. No no. You picked it up, you handed it me, and you said Votre plume, mademoiselle. Oh, yeah. Of course. You don't remember any of this, do you? Honestly, no. But does it really matter where we met? Um, does it matter? It's only the beginning of our relationship. Spence, we talked about how we both wanted to go to Paris someday. I can't believe I went through all this trouble and you don't even remember! - Wait, where are you going? - As far away from you as I can get! I understand there's a problem with the sweetbreads. And now, for her tireless work with troubled kids, it is my sincere pleasure to present our volunteer of the year award to Estelle Dabney. Thank you. And along with a plaque, comes a check for $500. Oh. I had almost forgot about that part. I assume you'll be putting that money towards your work with troubled children. What else would I do with it? Buy a gold lame tracksuit? It's not enough I got tricked, I gotta see that? Now I was hoping we could hear from the young man you brought with you tonight.Maybe he could say a few words? Oh. That's not a good idea. He's very troubled. Oh, I'd be happy to say a few words. The type of words I say will depend on my cut of the 500. That's blackmail. That's right. Thank you, old ladies. My name is Gabe and, I'm here to tell you the real story about Mrs. Dabney. Fifty-fifty. This woman Is my angel. Teddy I'm sorry I forgot how we met. It's about more than forgetting a few details. Sometimes I just feel like I'm more into this relationship than you are. Remember that period when we were broken up? Yeah. How long was that? I don't know. Like nine months? Eight months, 19 days and four hours. Wow. Teddy, you're the best thing that's ever happened to me. I may not remember the moment we met, but can still make this a moment to remember. How are we gonna do that? Well, I have an idea. Uh, do you guys mind? We're just trying to have a moment here. Yeah, and your moment is ruining my Halloween party. Okay. Um Why are you guys all dressed up in clown suits? Because we're clowns. So technically, you're not dressed up for Halloween, you're just wearing your work clothes. That's kinda what I've been saying. Whose side are you on?! And whatever you're cooking over there It's hurting my nose. Yeah? Well, your face is hurting my eyes, Bozo. I have a name. Okay. What is your name? Boom-boom. And I'm Tinkles. Boom-boom and Tinkles, You sound like two things my baby brother makes in his diaper. Hey! Nobody makes fun of my name! Sure we do. We got that whole bit where we walk down the street Shut up! This isn't over yet, missy. You messed with the wrong clowns. Oh. You know, it's a little hard to be scared of somebody with green hair and a permanent smile! - Okay, that's enough. - Just saying, geez. Tinkles, Binky, Bo-Bo, time to put on the big shoes. We got some work to do. I know sometimes Mrs. Dabney looks mean. But underneath that scowl There's a frown And underneath that frown There's a grimace. And if you keep chipping and chipping and chipping Underneath that You'll find a snarl. Move it along. And then, with just a little more chipping Underneath that You'll find a smile. A smile That has warmed my heart. And changed my life forever. Thank you, Gabe. That was very moving. Now let's take a break for dessert. Well. Here's something I've never said before You did good. Thank you. And I have to say, I admire you for scamming these helpless old ladies. It was good, wasn't it? You know, we make a pretty good team. We do, don't we? We should team up again. Got any other scams? I might have a few. Mrs. Dabney, this may be the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Here's looking at you, kid. Trick or treat. Aw. Aren't you adorable? You're a bee. A bee who's got to be home by nine. Let's see some candy. Wow, this bee's got a stinger. Uncle Milt's Honey Globs? Well, bees like honey, right? It's a costume, lady. Okay, see you next year! Doubt it. What the! - Hi, Mommy. - There's a bat in the house. - A bat?!  - It just flew in. Get it out, get it out, get it out! Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. This might be a job for Captain Extermo. You better ask him. Fine. Please help me, Captain Extermo. Now say my catchphrase. Captain Extermo, sleeping on the couch every night for the rest of his life. Close enough! And for your cheese course tonight Fromage American. I think we'll skip the cheese course. Excellent choice. The cheese course is traditionally when you tip the accordion player. - Go away. - Very good, Madame. This is the last time I let you talk me into playing the accordion for one of your fancy French dinners. It's probably the last time it'll come up. Now, um, I believe someone owes me a moment. I believe I do. I'll get it. Oh. Hey, look. The entertainment's here. I didn't order any entertainment. Well, someone did because there's a whole mess of clowns out there. Clowns?! No, don't open the door! Mrs. Dabney, I never imagined our criminal partnership would be so successful. It's like we belong together. And we're gonna stay together. For a long long time. - What are you doing here? - I just had the worst dream of my life. - Were we dancing? - Yes. - In handcuffs?  - Yes! What was that about?! It's called a guilty conscience! We have to give that money back. Oh, you think?! So I guess the partnership is over. Well, it was fun while it lasted. Mm. - Hug?   - Give Mama some sugar. Aw. Mrs. Dabney, we have to give back the money we stole. What do you mean, who is this? Hey, Charlie. So, uh Crazy Halloween for the Duncans. There was a bat in the house. Then for a short period of time, Gabe and Mrs. Dabney were friends. And then Spencer and I celebrated our one-year anniversary with a romantic dinner and A clown attack. But it wasn't actually that bad. For me. Then again, I'm not afraid of clowns. Clowns in my house. Clowns in my house. Clowns in my house. Well, at least he's talking. Clowns in my house! Wish him good luck, Charlie. We've had a lot of fun here tonight, at the expense of clowns. But we're here to let you know that clowning is a very serious profession. One that takes years of training. And contrary to what you saw tonight, we are not a violent people. Ah! We just wanna be treated with the same love and respect as everyone else. Stay in school, kids.
What is this? - Ooh ooh! I know!  - Wait. - I want Gabe to answer. - Aw. Uh It's a plate. Wrong. Whoa. That'll teach me to get cocky. It's a dirty plate, which you were supposed to put in the dishwasher. Now come on! How easy is that? If it's so easy, why didn't you do it? Now the plate's all the way out here and that one's on you. You know what, Mister? You just bought yourself a ticket to a weekend of yard work. Take care of the plate. He's really been on my case lately. I don't know what to do about it. Well You could put that plate in the dishwasher. Yeah, but then he wins. Brother man, you should do what I did. Get your own apartment. Dude, I'm 13. Well, then we're back to the plate. Oh hey! I got an idea. How about I come stay at your place this weekend? Oh, yeah, sure. Why not? Emmett's out of town. Should be fun. - Hey, can I bring Jake? - Sure. All right, this is great. Since I'm not here, I don't have to do yard work. And then guess who wins? - I do. - Yeah yeah No, I know. I was just. Got nervous after the whole plate thing. Today's all burnt toast  Running late, and dad jokes Has anybody seen my left shoe? I close my eyes, take a bite Grab a ride, laugh out loud There it is up on the roof. I've been there, I've survived So just take my advice. Hang in there, baby Things are crazy But I know your future's bright. Hang in there, baby There's no maybe Everything turns out all right. Sure life is up and down. But trust me, it comes back around. You're gonna love who  you turn out to be. Hang in there, baby. Spencer, how are you not understanding this? I just I just don't see what the big deal is. Okay okay. Let me break this down one more time. So, I had just done my big performance in drama class. And then, that horrible Ashley walks up to me and she says Looks like you're really having fun out there. I still don't see why that's so bad. She was totally insulting me! But By saying you had fun? Yes, that's what you say when somebody's performance stinks. Everybody knows that. Teddy, it just seems like you're making a big deal out of nothing. Oh yeah? Yeah? Well, it seems like you're making nothing out of a big deal! Yeah, that's what I meant to say. Okay. Who put all of Toby's stuffed animals on the porch? Gabe. Aw. She pinned her first crime on me. - What am I gonna do about this?  - About what? Charlie. She still doesn't like Toby. This has been going on for months. I thought she'd be over it by now. Mom, some things take time. I mean, I still don't like Charlie. Teddy doesn't like me. PJ doesn't like Teddy. It's what makes us a family. Gabe, I wanted this time to be different. After all, Toby is gonna be my last baby. Mm-hmm. Come on in. - Hey. - Hey. So. This is where you live, huh? Yep. Well, it's still beats doing yard work. Hey, Gabe's brother. - What's up? - Hey. - What happened to Jake? - He was busy, so I called a couple of other kids and, uh They weren't able to make it either, so Here's Logan. I'm often the last choice. Charlie, I bought you a present. Mm! Isn't it cute? Ohh. Here you go. Now, the first thing we need to do is name him. Right, now what's a really good name for a sweet little baby boy? Oh, well, there's Joby Or Kobe, or - Toby. - Toby! That's a great idea. So now when mommy's taking care of her baby you can take care of your baby. I'm going to pick up my Toby and give him a hug. Hello, little man. Hello. Ooh, big hug. Yeah. And you're gonna give your Toby a big hug. Oh. Mommy shoots  She scores. Hey, Spence. Flowers, huh? Yeah. I really owe Teddy an apology. For what? I have no idea. Luckily for you, I do. You know what? Step into my office. Okay. Look. The reason she got mad at you is that you didn't get upset about nothing. Yeah, but it was nothing, right? Well, of course it was nothing. - Well, I mean you know that. - Yeah. I know that. We're talking about the female of the species. Okay? A highly irrational creature. Fortunately for you, after 20 long years of marriage, I am kind of an expert. Okay. Look. The key. Is that you gotta let Teddy think that you care about All this stuff that's not worth caring about. Look, when they have an issue, like, like - Like Teddy did yesterday - Mm. You just don't react. You overreact. - So how do I do that? - I'll show you. Okay. - You know what, you be Teddy. - Okay. - I'll be you. All right. - Yeah. - Get mad about something. - Okay. Um. A girl at school didn't like my hair. What?!

You didn't let me finish. Spencer's here talking with your father. About what? That's the interesting part. Yeah. I just overheard Dr. Bob. Professor of Womanology Explain to Spencer that the best way of handling us gals is to pretend to care about stuff that isn't worth caring about. Really? Well, if I know Spencer, he said that that was ridiculous. Well, you don't know Spencer. I believe his exact words were This is really good stuff, Mr. Duncan. Huh.

What did you just say, Mister? Now you even sound like him. You know, I came over here to get away from him, not to be with dad junior. I am not dad junior. And you just bought yourself a ticket to doing the dishes. - We used paper plates. - And I want them spotless. Mary Lou, I should be a child psychologist. Really. I gave Charlie a Toby doll and she loves it. And pretty soon she'll feel the same way about the real Toby. I'm telling you, it's brilliant. One day it will simply be known as the Duncan method. Let me call you back. Charlie? Did you mistake the trash can for a magical doll house? No. I'm not two. Oh, Charlie. Why don't you love baby Toby? He loves you so much. - How do you know? - Because he told me. He can't talk. Or can he? What are you looking at? Yes No, I understand that I lost the receipt, but I never wore them, so why can't I take them back? But that's a stupid policy! Nev Never mind. What was that all about? I bought these running shoes, but they were in the wrong size and now the stupid store won't let me return them. Oh well. What are you gonna do? I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna get angry! How dare they treat you like that?! - What?  - I can't believe this. Who was the idiot you were dealing with? Uh, I think it was someone named Sam? Oh, Sam must have a brain the size of a walnut. Spencer, honey. Just calm down. No, I can't calm down, all right? Because I am so furious with this Sam! I am disgusted by Sam. I am so glad you feel this way. I'm gonna get my keys. Wait.

We have a problem. I'm Sam. What seems to be the problem? No problem. But you just said there was a problem. No, uh, no. She said it. Come on, Spencer. Tell him what you told me. Gosh. Who can remember? He said you have a brain the size of a walnut. Excuse me? Uh. To be fair, I've seen some pretty large walnuts. And And he said that he was disgusted by you.

Hey, dad. Just don't get a hairpiece. I mean, you gotta leave me something. Where the big people are so fat - P. J. , we're done. - Okay.

But trust me, it comes back around. You're gonna love who you turn out to be. Hang in there, baby. Great news! Remember that play I wrote? - The dancing Princess?  - Yeah. My theater group is doing the production and Ivy's directing. And I'm starring? - No. - Oh. Then what's the great news? Well, you're not in this one, mom, but guess who is. Charlie! I'm gonna be a Princess. Good for you. Hope show business doesn't break your heart as it did mine. Hey, Charlie. Why is that bear still on the floor? I asked you to pick that up an hour ago. Hey, Princess. I'm not gonna ask you again. Pick up the bear now. No. She's been like this all day. Mom. If I may Charlie, sweetie. Could you pick up that bear for your big sister, please? Okay. If you need her to do anything else, just let me know. She's three years old. You got lucky. No no. It's not luck. Charlie and I have a special sister bond. I guess you could call me The Charlie Whisperer. The Charlie Whisperer. Okay. Well, if you're so good, why don't you get her to come out of your room? I did that one with my mind. What you working on? Oh, it's for English. I have to write a report about an old person. My neighbor Bert By Gabe Duncan. Bert Doogan Husband, Father Astronaut? Whoa! I didn't know grumpy old Bert was an Astronaut. Neither does grumpy old Bert. I made the whole thing up. It was either that or actually talking to the old dude. Whenever I mow Bert's lawn, he tells me stories about his adventures in space. There was this one time where his rocket sprung a leak and he fixed it, with toothpaste and moon rocks. Come on, dude! No one's gonna believe that. What, the moon rocks? No, that you mowed somebody's lawn. Oh! Oh, there's my favorite playwright. There's my favorite Director! This is so exciting. I didn't even know you wanted to direct. Are you kidding? I talk loud, I like to boss people around I'm a natural. Now let's talk casting. Yes! Okay. Well, uh, at least we know who's gonna play the young Princess - Charlie. - Whoa. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Charlie's got to audition like everybody else. Okay, I get it. You want me to bring Charlie in for an Audition. Yes, I Do. Ivy, look. It's just one line and I wrote it for Charlie. And if she can say it, she gets the part. Hello. Mrs. Duncan, please stop calling me. You cannot be in the play. Hey, guys. What was that? Uh Bob, honey? Could you come out here please? Whatcha wearing? What, this? Got it at the Mall. Yeah, some regular store. Whatever. Oh, the place was called Cloz, with a Z. Cloz? I shop there. At least I used to. Ooh, question about this Cloz with a Z Um, do they have mirrors or lights? All right, all right. All right, fine. I know what you're thinking. Hey, at first, I wasn't sure about this new look either. But you know what? Everybody kept complimenting me. Really? Yeah, they said I was making it work. Rockin' that outfit. Oh, yeah Killin' those jeans. Not sure that last one was a compliment. And those are the kind of uplifting stories my neighbor Bert tells me whenever my brother P. J. Mows his lawn. Gabe, that was wonderful. Thank you. No, thank you for giving me the assignment. You know, Bert sounds like an incredible man. Do you think he could come in and speak to the class? Um you know I don't think that's a good idea. He's not moving around very well anymore. Astronauting is very hard on the knees. Well, if you bring him in, I'll give you extra credit. And it could bring your grade up to an A. Huh. An A in English. Woo! Can't ask for more better than that. Next! Okay. For the role of the young Princess, presenting Charlie Duncan. Hi, Charlie. Okay, Charlie, say the line. Charlie, hey. Charlie, remember, your line is Your majesty, I was born to dance. Okay? Now you say it. I turned my ears off. Here, just can you give us a minute? Okay. Who's next? Hi, I'm Tammy. Hi, Tammy. Whenever you're ready. Your majesty, I was born to dance. Tammy, that was very good. Wow. What did you think? A little show-offy for my taste. Oh, come on! She's fantastic. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, yeah sure, she can act and dance and say the line, but once you take that away, then what do you have? Charlie. Okay. We have got two great candidates for the role of the young Princess. Let's just compare them objectively. Charlie versus Hammy. Tammy. Oh, it's too late. I've already wrote a Hammy. Okay! First category Cuteness. Well, Charlie gets a 10. No no question there. And, uh, Tammy Let's be generous and give her a five. A five? Is that too high? I'll make it a four. Okay, next category personality. - Tammy has a nice smile. - With dead shark eyes. I'll make it another four. Charlie gets a 10. How about the ability to say lines? Oh. Yeah. There is some, uh. There is some debate there. You know what? Let's just give them each a five. And there you have it! Charlie is the clear-cut winner! Oh, Teddy! Come on! But the numbers don't lie. I didn't just make them up. Yes, you did! Ivy, I will get her to say the line. I'm The Charlie Whisperer. All right. She's got the part. I don't know how I'm gonna explain this to Tammy. Don't worry about Tammy. She's gonna get tons of parts. She's amazing. - Ooh, cookies. - Hey, they're not for you. - They're for Bert.  - Bert's coming over? Yeah, and can you stick around? You have a way with old people. Usually, it creeps me out, but now I need you. Hey! Bert! Come on in. I've been living across the street from you people for 20 years and I've never been invited over. We're shy. Shy? I hear that mother of yours singing and dancing all the time! - Women, huh, Bert?  - Hey, tell me about it. Cookie? Yeah, sure. That is a nice cardigan. They don't make them like that anymore. You got that right. Now you, I like. Anyhoo, Bert. I was wondering if you could come to my class and talk about your amazing career. Amazing? I was a Mailman. Good stuff. Good stuff. But let me just suggest one small A little tiny tweak. Instead of Mailman, let's use a different word. Letter carrier? I was thinking Astronaut. You want me to lie? What's wrong with being a Mailman? Nothing. It's just that the kids these days, they're not as easily entertained. What with the video games, the gizmos and the gadgets. We're losing our country, Bert. That's what I always say when I'm talking to my radio. So so you'll do it? No! I'm not gonna lie about my job. What will you lie about? Your vacations? And could one of them possibly have been to Jupiter? Are you off your nut? Who raised you anyway? Hey, Bert. Okay, it's not your fault. Charlie, it's just one line. Say it with me. Your majesty, I was born to dance. Charlie, come on, please. Hey, girls. What's going on? I can't get Charlie to say her line. Why don't you just do it with your mind? If you're done mocking me, I could really use your help here. Oh, sweetheart. I'll never be done mocking you. Okay, relax. I have an idea. Okay, Charlie. We're gonna read a fun new book. It's called your majesty, I was born to dance. Ohh! That sounds like a great title. You wanna say that? Yeah, do you wanna say it like the Princess in the book? That's a dog. Well, it's a doggy Princess with an invisible tiara. I want another book. Come on, Charlie. You can say the line. Your majesty, I was born to dance. Your majesty, I was born to dance. Oh! Who's The Charlie Whisperer now? All right, here he is Bert Doogan, famous Astronaut. Well, Bert. Thank you so much for joining us. Why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself? Could Bert take off his helmet? Uh, no. Next question. So we have a speaker who can't actually speak? Okay, kids. Let's all line up and we can all touch Bert's helmet, and then he'll be on his way. I'll go first. Gabe, who is this? It's Bert, my neighbor. Bert looks surprisingly young. Oh, thank you, dear. That's sweet of you to say. Gabe, I want the truth. Okay. The truth is that On his last mission, Bert went through a wormhole sending him back in time. Gabe Duncan, I should have known better. - You know, you really should have. - Well, I should get going. To infinity and beyond! Oh hey, hon'. Hey! There's my baby boy. Um, Bob, hon', you - You missing something? - Wha oh! This? Aw, I just decided to update the work threads. Well, sweetie. You're an exterminator. Isn't the point of your uniform to protect you from things that sting and bite? Hey, these cannons are my protection. Oh. Daddy's gone crazy. Mama's gonna fix it. - Hey. - Where have you been? - And where's Charlie? - She's at home. - What?! - She refused to come. And then when I asked her nicely, she turned off her ears and she ran away from me. How could you do this to me? Look, it's not completely my fault. Okay? A good Director would have chosen Tammy! Teddy, the The young Princess goes on in two minutes. What are we gonna do? I'll take care of it. Your majesty, I was born to dance! Hey. What's going on? Vern, what are you doing here? I'm here because I love you, man. Uh-oh. Bob, honey. Come here. Have a seat next to me. Now, sweetie, we have some things we'd like to say, so please just hear us out. Teddy? You start. Dad, I miss the old you. You know, the normal guy whose clothes aren't tighter than mine. Okay. P. J. Dad I want us to shop at different stores. I don't want us to have the same pants. For the record, I love your new look! It's a comedic gold mine. - For instance - Uh, uh, thank you, Gabe. Vern? Would you like to share? Look at me, boss. I had to expose my flesh to the enemy just so you could show off your guns. What's going on, Bob? Are you having some sort of a mid-life crisis? No! I All right. A couple of months ago I'm in the park with Toby and, uh Somebody thought I was his grandfather. So you went through all of this because of some off-handed comment from a stranger? Yeah! But it guys, it inspired me to lose weight, get in shape. And your new body is great. What you've chosen to put on your new body Not so great. Dad. Will you accept our help and return those clothes today? There's a car waiting outside to take you to an age-appropriate store. All right, fine. I'll go. But, um you're gonna have to give me 20 minutes to get out of these pants. Well, Charlie. Dad returned all the clothes, so there's one less teenager in the house. And in other news Hey! Keep it down in there! Gabe got in trouble at school, so now he has to interview our neighbor Bert for real. Now where was I? 1983. 1983. The first-class stamp cost 20 cents. And the zip plus-four code was established. Now the Z. P. 4. Code,. was originally supposed to be just a Z. P. 3. Now this is where it gets complicated, so just stay with me. It looks like Gabe's gonna be there a while. Wish him good luck, Charlie. All right, Vern. You wanna look good in that uniform, we gotta get you into shape. All right. Now before we begin, we need to stretch out. You are limber! All right, let's try some sit-ups. Now watch my technique. All right, your turn. Vern? You okay? I think I did a little bit too much too fast, boss.

You're not in trouble. Then why do we need to talk? Well, it's about your dad. Now you're aware that he occasionally snores, right? Mom, the people across the street are aware. Car alarms are aware. Kansas is aware. Well, obviously, I'm used to his snoring because I grew up next to train tracks. But your father's been waking Toby up and I'm trying to get the baby to sleep through the night. How does this involve me? We're going to have to temporarily change our sleeping arrangements. Man, you're putting Toby in with me? Not exactly. Hey, roomie!

Her mean brothers called her Junie the Puny Uni. - That's not very nice. - No, it isn't. Shh. One day, Junie and her family went to the meadow for a picnic. The meadow was right next to the dark forest, a place Junie was forbidden to go. But her curiosity got the better of her. - Uh-oh. - I'm thirsty. Suck it up. Junie's in trouble.

Also known as story time. Okay, where were we? Oh, yeah. Junie was at the Cave of Shadows. As Junie entered the cave, she was scared, but also very curious. She crept ahead cautiously. I'm tired. Yeah, well, so was Junie. But she keeps going. All-night bowling dad, you're an animal! - PJ?!  - Dad? - Where are you going? - Uh, nowhere. - Why is Charlie up?  - No reason. - Why is Gabe up? - No reason. What's with the book? What's with the bowling ball? None of this ever happened. None of what ever happened? Let's go, dad. He can keep this up all night. Keep what up all night? Suddenly two bright green eyes opened wide and lit up the rocky den. And Junie stood face-to-face with a giant fire-breathing dragon! He opened his mouth and roared -PJ?! -Mom! What are you doing? What are you doing? That only works with your dad. What's going on here? It was Charlie's idea. She wanted to finish the book. Oh, okay. So Charlie got up in the middle of the night, called you at your apartment and told you to come over for a book sesh? She's a scamp. - Come on, Charlie. - Ah, okay. Good night, PJ. Well, what's she doing tomorrow? - Preschool.  - Again? That's every day now? - Morning, Gabe. - I want him out. - Who?  - Dad. I haven't slept a wink in 48 hours. Except a quick little nap during math class. Is this about his snoring? No! I gave him a taste of freedom and he went crazy. Yeah. Dad does better with rules. Lots and lots of rules. I can't do it anymore. You gotta take him back. Tonight. Calm down, okay? This is your dad we're talking about. Let's show a little respect. We'll flip a coin. - Heads, you're stuck with him. - Tails, he's my problem. Deal. Please be tails. Please be tails. Please be tails. Hey. Whatcha doing? Fighting over you. So who won? -Aw! Gabe! -Yes! Welcome back. - Hi.  - So? How'd the test go? Well. of course I won't know for a while, but I think I did really well. Now, in accordance with our agreement, you need to accompany me to my chess match. Right right, the chess match. - Teddy, it's just a chess match. - Sure. Okay. Well, what do I have to wear? A bird suit or a robot outfit? Actually, what you have on now is perfect. Come on, Andrew. It's your move. It is? Oh, right. Checkmate. What! No! It can't be! Curse you, Deleseur! We're done here. Thank you, Teddy. Nerd bait. Not my finest hour. Well, Charlie. I got my SAT results back, and let's just say I did pretty well. I'm trying not to be supercilious. Did I use that right? Who cares? Test's over. Hey, check it out. The sequel to The Littlest Unicorn just came out. Revenge of The Littlest Unicorn. Have you seen Charlie? Uh, yeah. And she told me to tell you that she's not home. Man! Well, who am I supposed to read this to? Hello, Toby! Okay, chapter one. Junie had an axe to grind Well. Sounds like there's gonna be a beat down in Butterflylandia. Better wish Junie some good luck, Charlie. Charlie, are you ready to go to the park now? No! PJ, thanks to that stupid book you read her Charlie's afraid to go outside. She thinks there's a dragon out there. There is. Will you please explain to your sister the difference between what's real and what's not? Okay, Charlie. It's very simple. Unicorns are real, dragons are not. Okay. Are you ready to go now? No. Okay, mom. I got this. Charlie, there is no dragon out there. Look, I'll show you. Told you.
Deck the halls with boughs of Holly. Fa la la la la la la la la la. 'Tis the season Hi! Hey, sounding good, Mrs. Duncan. Oh! I know. It's going to sound even better when I sing it tonight at the annual Duncan Christmas Eve Talent Show. Oh, mom, Spencer and I are singing too. We even worked out a new Christmas song together. Oh, that is so wonderful! And so brave of you to sing the same night I do. Well, we're off to Super Christmas Land. Ooh, Super Christmas Land? What's that? Oh, that's what Super Adventure Land calls itself, for one week each year at Christmas time. Last week it was Super Hanukkah Land. Next week it's Super Kwanzaa Land. Merry Christmas, everybody! Oh, grandma's here! - Yay. - Oh! Oh oh! Charlie, what do you have to say to grandma? Good-bye. Sorry, she's just excited. We're off to have her very first picture taken with Santa. I understand. Okay, well, we gotta run, but we can't wait to see you later. - Oh, good. - Okay. - All right, bye. - Bye. Oh, Amy. It's nice to see you. Oh, Linda, it's nice to see you. Well. The decorations look nice and whatnot. Although that wreath is in the wrong place. I like it there. I'll fix it later. Okay. Bob? - Oh, my goodness! - Mom! Is that my son or Hercules? Oh, mom! Please! Dropped some weight, got totally buff. Don't make a fuss. So, how was the flight? Oh, you know, the usual delays and whatnot. But everybody on the plane loved the song that I'm going to sing at the Talent Show. Deck the halls with boughs of Holly Oh, whoa whoa whoa whoa!Hang on there, grandma. I'm singing Deck The Halls. Sweetheart, maybe you should clean the halls before you deck them. I may deck something besides the halls. Okay, stand down. We both can't sing the song and I did come all the way from Phoenix. She did come all the way from Phoenix. - Well, it's my house. - It is her house. - I gave birth to you. - I married you. Ba-bam!. Okay, fine! Nobody sings it. That's my final decision. Oh, that's your decision? Who died and made you King of the Talent Show? - Really! - Unbelievable. Yay, Christmas. Today's all burnt toast  Running late, and dad jokes Has anybody seen my left shoe I close my eyes, take a bite Grab a ride, laugh out loud There it is up on the roof. I've been there, I survived. So just take my advice. Hang in there, baby Things are crazy But I know your future's bright. Hang in there, baby There's no maybe Everything turns out all right. Sure life is up and down. But trust me, it comes back around. You're gonna love who you turn out to be. Hang in there, baby. Hey, guys? Uh, listen. I need a favor. Well, since we're still in the pre-Christmas gotta-be-nice zone. What can we do for you? I need you to find out what your mom got me for Christmas. - Why? - Well, because. Every year, your mom and I,we make this agreement not to spend too much on each other's presents but I never know what that means. I would have thought not spending too much is a phrase you're very familiar with. Every year I wind up getting it wrong. Oh, right, like the time she bought you really nice watch and you got her those - Uh, what were they called again? - Slocks. They're not slippers, they're not socks. They're Slocks. That was the Christmas that mom kept slipping and falling. Slocks they're not just ugly, they're dangerous. All right. Come on, guys. Hey. When you were doing your present snooping, did you happen to see what your mom got me? Dad, I'm older now. I don't do that anymore. And thanks for the headphones! Well, naughty can't help me. Let's try nice. - Ooh, that's me! - Ha ha, PJ! Come on, find out from your mom what she got me. - All right, I'll talk to her. - All right, great. She'll tell you anything. We all know you're her favorite. He is? Well, hey hey hey! I didn't say my favorite. That would be Teddy, right? No comment. Oh, relax. I'm sure you're in the top five. I know that you're tired and you're hungry and your feet are cold, but all this whining doesn't help. But it's taking so long! When do I get to see Santa? Really soon, I promise. Yeah, if that kid would ever get off Santa's lap. He's been on there for like 10 minutes. Yeah, what's taking him so long? It should be sit, list, snap, go. Sit, list, snap, go! How hard is that? Santa can hear you, young lady. Yeah, well, that's kind of the idea, Santa. But seriously, you might want to cool it, all right? - Carl's not the nicest guy. - Wait, you know Santa? Yeah, from when we worked here. I did a show with him. The tribute to America. He played Johnny Appleseed before he put on the weight. Santa heard that too. - Hey, mom. - Hey. What you doing? Welding. Good good. So, listen, I was thinking about what present to get for dad. And I don't want to get him the same thing you did. What did you get him again? Did your dad send you down here to find out what I got him? I'm not prepared for any follow-up questions. I'm not going to tell you what I got him. Then I won't ask again. Am I still your favorite? That's why you're my favorite. Yes! Well, then I'll let you get back to your welding. - Good news, guys. - You found out what your mom's getting me? No, but I confirmed I'm her favorite. Well, there you go. Gonna fail Christmas again. Maybe I can help you. You already bought mom a gift, right? And I'm guessing it's somewhere in the Slocks area? Actually, I got her a very special foam rug for the kitchen. Something she can stand on when she's doing the dishes. It's called the foot cush. Oh, so you want the Slocks to seem like the good old days. Wow, dad, you set the bar so low, I can't believe you went under it. - Good one. - Thank you. I like yours too. Guys, I'm just trying to be thoughtful. Look, your mom saw a foot cushion in a store once, and she said she might like one. All right, so the point is you got the cheap gift covered. Now all you have to do is buy mom a nice gift. Buy her two gifts? Exactly. Then hide them in different places and after you open mom's gift to you, you'll know which one to give her. Gabe! That's genius. Eh? There you go. That's why you're my favorite. This whole favorite thing is starting to lose all meaning. Yes. We're next, Charlie. Teddy, look. Back in one hour?! You can't do that. Sorry, missy, I get a one hour break every four hours I work. Union rules. - What Union? - H. A. G. The Holiday Actors Guild. No no, wait. Come on, come on. Look, we've been waiting here for two hours. Okay, we're hungry, we're tired Take it up with H. A. G. now get out of my way. You're not going anywhere, Santa. Try and stop me. Ha ha ha! Whoops! Oh, Teddy. Yes! Let's get the picture. Here, I'll hold Santa's arms down. Step away from the fat man. Well well well. If it isn't Teddy Duncan. Howdy, Sheriff. Merry Christmas. You redecorated. Place looks good. We try to give it a holiday feel. - Hey, honey. - Oh, Bob? Um, I've decided I'm not going to sing Deck The Halls at the Talent Show. Really? Oh, thank you. Thank you for taking the high road and keeping the peace. I'm going to do an impression instead. - An impression? - Mmm. Of a family member. Can you guess who? I flew all the way in from Phoenix and whatnot. And, oh oh! Bobby is so muscley and whatnot. Oh. Hey, mom. Um, how much did you hear?. I didn't hear a thing. I just wanted to tell you that I've decided to let Amy sing Deck The Halls this year. Well, I'm glad somebody understands the true spirit of Christmas. Instead I'm going to do an impression of a family member. Oh. Can you guess who? My house is dirty. Ba-bam! I can't even hang a wreath. Ba-bam! - Whatnot. - Ba-bam! - Whatnot! - Ba-bam! Oh, come on. You know what?  I've had it with the two of you. Forget it. Talent Show is canceled. - Who does he think he is?  - You gave birth to him. Well, you married him. Ba-bam! So last year, you tackled the Super Adventure Land Mayor. Today you bowled over Santa Claus. What's next? You gonna harpoon The Easter Bunny? Well, I don't know. I haven't made my plans yet for easter. How much longer do I have to stay in here? You aren't going anywhere till we have a trial. Can't have a trial till the Judge gets here. Well, when will that be? Super Adventure Land Christmas court is now in session. Santa? This is not how I wanted to be spending my break. Teddy Duncan, you may approach the bench. Finally. In the case of Kringle versus Duncan, you are charged with assault with a snowman head. How do you plead? Not guilty by reason of being Not guilty. All right, Santa. In your own words, tell us exactly what happened. Well, I was taking my H. A. G. mandated break and then she attacked me. Ask him. He saw the whole thing. Uh, your honor, I have to recuse myself. I'm in a very happy and committed relationship with the defendant. Ooh, Sweetie. Thank you, Sweetie, you are recused. All right, let's hear from the defense. Your honor, if I may, Christmas is the most magical time of year. And who loves it more than anyone? The children. And I was just trying to make one child happy. So if that's a crime, well, then call me a criminal. Or don't. You know, whatever gets me out of here faster. I've heard enough. I'm ready to rule. My verdict is guilty. Yes! You're guilty. Me? I'm I'm not on trial here. I've never liked you, Carl. It's time you learned a little something about Christmas spirit. I sentence you to one picture with this little girl. Thank you, Sheriff. Yay. Jolly it up, Carl. What you doing? What are you looking at? What you doing? Oh. Oh, he's such a sweet little angel. Aw, he sure is. It's too bad his first Christmas has all this fighting and unpleasantness. I know. I have a solution. I'll help you pack. I was going to say that we should sing Deck The Halls together. You mean as a duet? Yes. So, let's du-et. Yeah! Let's give it up for the great Bobbini and his assistant Charlie! Okay, quick question for Bobbini. That dove you made disappear? Where is it? Oh, don't worry, honey. We'll find it later Hopefully. Okay, well, up next, the musical stylings of grandma and mom. Deck the halls with boughs of Holly. Fa la la la la la la la la la.

While I tell of yuletide treasure. Fa la la la la la. La la la la! Well, there you have it, grandma and mom working together for the first and probably the last time. Okay, next we have PJ and Gabe doing what are you guys doing? An exercise in improvisational theater. That's right. Improv at its finest, people. We are looking for suggestions from the audience. We need an occupation and an object. - A lawyer and a rock. - Has to be a cop and a banana. - A cop and a banana. - Excellent suggestion. Oh, here I am being a cop. Ooh, look at that. A banana. Now I'm peeling the banana. Hey, I'm a criminal. Give me that banana. No, it's my banana. And scene. Okay, now Spencer and I are going to sing a new Christmas song for you. Hope you like it.

Hey, what are you you can't - This is from me and PJ! - Oh, my goodness! A foot cush? Yeah. How did you guys know? Seriously, you guys! I have been wanting one of these forever. Oh, my gosh.

So, you finally got your first picture with Santa Claus. That I'm mentioning for the very first time. Hey, any chance I could say good luck, Charlie? - I've never said it before. - Oh, yeah. Sure, of course. - Good luck, Charlie.  - Hey! Ba-bam! Hey. You got your first picture with Santa. Good luck, Charlie. Snowy the Snowman, registered trademark of Super Adventure Land, incorporated? What are you doing here? My head's fine. Thanks for asking. Oh, are you mad because I used your head as a bowling ball? Little bit. Look, I'm I'm really sorry. Come on in. Hey, how about I make it up to you? How about some cookies? I could eat. Great. All right, well, make yourself comfortable. I'll be right back. Okay, so great news, we've got chocolate chip, peanut butter Yeee! Oh! Snowy, no! I'm having a bad day.
Well, Charlie, here we are in our hotel room, and we're not on vacation. Confused? Well, get comfortable, because it's a doozy. Charlie, get out of the bathroom! In a minute! Hey. Come on, guys. Huh?. Not so bad. Kind of an adventure. - Oh, save it. - Be quiet! Shut up. Come on. I'm just trying to make the best of it. - Because you caused it. - Not totally my fault. - Then whose fault was it? - I'll get back to you on that. Ugh. Teddy, I need a hand. So how we got here is kind of a long story. Let's just say this is the worst day in Duncan family history. - Teddy, now! - I'm coming! To be continued. Oh. You hear that, Toby? It's called quiet. Enjoy it while you can, because in this house it doesn't last long. - Mom! - Hmm? Told you. Why is Toby's crib in my room? Because you two are sharing a room now. - We talked about this. - No, we didn't. We didn't? Oh, well, Toby and I talked, and he's fine with it. I I can't share a room with a baby. I'm a teenager now. I need my own space. Well, I'm sorry, honey, but we only have so many rooms. Besides, you love Toby. This isn't about love. This is about square footage. Well, if it makes it any easier, Toby's about the same age you were when you moved in with P. J. Yeah, but with me and P. J. , the little brother was in charge. That ain't happening with us. Oh aren't you adorable? Stop that, Gabe! Stay strong. Today's all burnt toast  Running late, and dad jokes Has anybody seen my left shoe I close my eyes, take a bite Grab a ride, laugh out loud There it is up on the roof I've been there, I've survived So just take my advice Hang in there, baby Things are crazy But I know your future's bright Hang in there, baby There's no maybe Everything turns out all right Sure life is up and down But trust me it comes back around You're gonna love who you turn out to be Hang in there, baby. Oh, hey, P. J. you are a good cook. Could you taste this and tell me what you think? Sure. Um What is it? Well, that's not a good question. It's New England clam chowder. Ah. Well, I'm not getting any chowder Or clams. Or even England. It is new, though. Oh man! I wanted to make Spencer a special welcome-home lunch. He was visiting BIPA. BIPA, the Boston Institute of Performing Arts. He's hoping to go there next Fall. There he is. Hey, um, do you think you could rescue this? - No problem. - Thank you. Step one. Oh! I'm so glad you're home. - So how was BIPA? - Supa. It's how they say super in Boston. I know. Hey, you wanna hear how they say, go park your car in Harvard Yard? Pahk your cah in hahvahd yahd. Supa. Mine's better. So hey, how was it? Oh my gosh, the school is amazing. - I mean, I loved it. - That's awesome. So when do you find out if you got in? I already found out. They accepted me. Way to go, boyfriend! Oh yeah, uh-huh. Why am I the only one doing a happy dance? Well, because because there's one other thing. Um, they want me to start a little early. Well, like how early? Monday. - What?  - Yeah, it's called early enrollment. They have a space available and if I want it, I have to take it right now. But you haven't finished high school. Yeah, I know, but I already have enough credits to graduate. Wow. This is Wow. Hey, Teddy I haven't made my decision yet. I mean, I wanted to talk to you first. What do you think? I don't know. I'm just kind of in shock. Yeah, me too. Who's ready for some delicious New England chicken noodle chowder? Denver Omelet? Guys, guys, I had an unbelievable day at work. Wait until I tell you what happened. Oh, I think I hear Toby. Baby's right there. - Oh, then I think I hear Charlie. - Charlie's at a play date. I'm trying to get out of a bug story, work with me here. Okay. So I'm doing a routine spray job over at the Andersons' They have a monthly maintenance package, so that means I go every other Tuesday. So the first Tuesday is perimeter, the second Tuesday's interior. - I think I hear the doorbell. - Oh no, you don't. Anyway, long story short - I captured these bad boys. - Ugh. Huh? Brazilian termites. Very rare, very destructive and they've never been found in North America Until now. Well, if they're so destructive, why would you bring them into our house? Our wooden house? Honey, I'm not an idiot. This container termite-proof. - Are you sure? - I am sure. Besides, it's only gonna be for one night. Tomorrow I'm taking em to the University of Denver. This could land me in the exterminator hall of fame. Bob honey, that doesn't exist. Honey, yes, it does. It's in Detroit. Used to be in Cleveland, but they had to move it. Rat problem. So I know that it's a great opportunity, but if Spencer leaves now, I'm gonna be so sad. We have so many plans for the rest of the year. When I get a boyfriend, we're gonna make bunch of plans too. Maybe you should make a plan to get a boyfriend. Maybe you should make a plan not to tell me to make a plan. Volleyball friends, huh? Well, one problem at a time. So Spencer asked me what I thought he should do And I don't know what to tell him. I think if you're lucky enough to get a boyfriend, you should never ever let him go Even if you have to lock him in the basement and not tell anybody. So Of course I don't want Spencer to go, but I also don't want to be the one to keep him from going. Oh man. I wish I had some experience with these things, but for some reason boys find me weird and off-putting. Not just boys, sweetie. Kelsey, what do you think? I think whatever happens is gonna be great. But if Spencer goes, then Teddy will be crushed. - You make a good point. - And if he doesn't go, - he might be miserable. - That's a good point, too. So what are you saying? That I agree with everybody. But you can't agree with everybody. You are absolutely right. You just did it again! Okay, I've made my decision. - What is it? - I need some new friends. My little Deedee just loves playing with your little Charlie. Oh. Although, last time she asked me, why does Charlie have a boy's name? And I didn't know what to tell her. Hey, honey. How's your play date going? - Eh. - Mmm. Follow up question: Where's Deedee? In jail. Final question: What does jail mean exactly? Uh, well, it means, we'd better go check. Oh, my. Oh. Oh, Deedee. - Not funny. - Oh, sorry. - Oh. - Yeah, you guys go play. Maybe we should just stay in here with the girls for a while. - Sounds like a good idea. - Okay, sure. Well, at least this will make a good post for my blog. Uh, you have a blog? I call it Mama Debbie's Daily Doing's. Oh, you're serious. You betcha. I post recipes, offer helpful hints Share fun things Doug Dooley and I do together. Just passing along some of the things I've learned about motherhood and such. Wow, and you've based this on your vast experience with one child? And one on the way for a total of two. Oh. I have a total of five. It's not a competition. It wasn't. - What are you doing down here? - Toby kept me up all night. Ah. It's called payback. When you were a baby, you used to make my life miserable, too. I will never forget the night I woke up in your crib and you were in my bed. I still have no idea how you did that. Well, me and Toby sharing a room is not gonna work. Something has to be done now. Oh! Are you gonna do something bad? Because that'd be great - For me. - What are you talking about? Well, I have to break some difficult news to mom and dad, and they're not gonna be happy. So I was thinking maybe if you got in trouble, I could sneak my news in and kind of piggyback on your badness. Well, what's the news? Oh, it's nothing. You know, I'd get it out of you, but I am way too tired. So what do you think? You gonna be getting into trouble anytime soon? I don't know. It's different. I'm a teenager now. Well, what kind of attitude is that? That is quitter talk. Brazilian termites. This is the most exciting thing since I discovered those Ukrainian grub worms in 06. Excuse me, I discovered those. No, I was in the crawl space. You were in the port-a-john. Fine. Here. Feast your eyes on those little beauties. I don't see em. - Well, they're in there. - Are you sure? All I see are two little holes. Holes?! Oh no. No no no! They ate right through the plastic! Oh, this is bad. This is really bad. Okay, look, we gotta wipe em out before they multiply More importantly, before Amy finds out. Well, we could tent the place. Hey, there you go. She'll never notice a giant gas-filled tarp covering the house. Well, then what are we gonna do? I've got an idea. To the bug mobile! I love when he does that. Hey, sweetie, can you go get me the jail? Mommy needs to do laundry. - Okay. - Thank you, sweetie. Hi, Charlie. Hey, mom. - Hey, sweetie. - What you doing? Working on my mommy blog. Mommy blog? That doesn't sound like you. I am gonna kick Debbie Dooley's butt. That sounds like you. The only problem is I'm having trouble coming up with topics. What kind of stuff does Debbie post about? - Recipes - Ooh, so that's out. She also writes about fun stuff she does with her husband, so that's out too. Hey, where is Gabe? He's always up to something? Well, here's hoping. I mean for you and your blog. Not for me. Why would I need him to do anything bad? Coming! - Hey. - Hi. - So listen, I - So, Teddy, I - You first. - Okay, um I'm just gonna come out and say it. I think you should go to Boston. Because I was kinda leaning towards not going. - Why? - I just don't think I can leave you. Oh, Spence, but BIPA is your dream school. It's the best musicprogram in the country and you know if you don't grab this opportunity, you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life. Yeah, but it's not the only college out there. I mean, I could stay here and audition for the Denver Institute of Performing Arts. - DIPA? - Yeah. DIPA's not as good as BIPA. Oh yeah? You know who went to DIPA? - Kelly Ripa. - Ripa went to DIPA? No, I just wanted to hear you say that. Hey, you know you have to do this. Yeah, but what about us? Well, there will still be an us, just a long-distance us. - You really think we can make that work? - Hey, nothing is far away anymore. We can we can text. We can talk on the phone. We can video chat. We can email. Oh, and the great part is that when I smell funny You won't have a clue. - Hey, you never smell funny. - I know. It's gonna be okay, sweetie. We can do this. Yeah, of course we can. So when do you have to leave? Tomorrow. Okay. Then come here. Until tomorrow, I'm not gonna let you go. Me neither. Hey, it's kinda cold out here. You wanna go inside? Sure. Okay, my hungry little ants Today's special is Brazilian. Bon Appetit. - Dad? - Ow! - P. J. ! - Why are you releasing ants in the house?. Uh, because I'm training. Uh, I'm uh, letting the ants go now so I can catch em again later. All the exterminators do it. Dad, do you think it's fair to say I'm not the brightest Duncan? It it's more than fair, son. So if I'm not buying this story, who do you think will? All right, look, um Those Brazilian termites that I brought home? They got out, so I brought in some ants, because the ants will eat the termites. See? So it's gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be fine. Why don't you just tent the house? Because I don't want your mom to find out. Because if mom found out, that'd be bad. That would be very bad. But she's not gonna find out. Right, right. Uh, but when she does, could you let me know? - Why? - Just because. It's not like I have something to hide. Coming! - Hello? - It's open! - What is this? - It's my new room. No, it's not. Then what's my bed doing here? Gabe, you are not taking over the living room. It's not the living room. It's the fireplace area. Oh yeah, that makes me feel better Gabe With fire in his room. Now pack it up! That's what I get for answering the curtain. It's so good to see your face. I know it's only been a few days, but I miss you so much. I miss you too. And I'm sorry we haven't been able to talk very much it's just With orientation and everything It's okay. I get it. Teddy, can you give me a hand with Toby? Be right back. - Hey, Mr. Duncan. - Oh!. Spencer? What are you doing on the computer? Oh, just video-chatting. Hey, how about that? You see the butt scratch? Yes, Sir. I had an itch. Oh no, I completely understand. It's just Well, after the scratch you picked up an apple. Then you put it back. Well, yeah, I just I realized I was in the mood for cereal. Not really the point. - Okay, I'm back. - See you. Finally, we're all alone. Hello. Except for Charlie. - Hi, Charlie. - How did he get in there? Charlie, Spencer's not really in the computer. He's in Boston. - Can you see me? - I sure can. I just can't see your sister. Yeah, just chilling in my new room, dude. Yeah, I'm loving it. Um, I'm gonna need to call you back. No, the spin cycle just started. This might be a problem. - Hi. - Hi. Just thought I'd pop over and tell you, - I saw your blog. - Oh. And I especially enjoyed your first post, that darn Carlie. So important to proofread. Oh. Well uh, thank you. And next time you have any helpful suggestions, don't come over. Yeah. Just feel free to put it in my comments section. Oh, that's thoughtful. Mm-hmm. Well, I always enjoy telling you where to put things. Mmm. Since I'm here now, let me give you a few tips. I call them Debbie Dooley's dos and don'ts. Do use spell-check. Don't not use spell-check. Do know that my blog will always be more popular than yours. Don't think it won't. Okay. That's great. That's great. Though, you know, I have some helpful hints myself. Yeah. Do go back to where you came from. Don't bother me again. So how's the long-distance relationship going? Not good. You know, we both have such different schedules, we barely had any time to talk. Told you you should've locked him in the basement. I know it's only been three days, but I miss him so much. I just wish I could see him. So why don't you? Fly all the way to Boston by myself? My mom and dad would never let me do that. Unless they didn't know about it. You could just tell them that you're spending the weekend at my house. That's good. I like that. So this weekend, we'll be at Your house. Yeah, sleepover at Ivy's! It's not really happening. Yeah, it's not really happening. I'll bring the I'll bring the popcorn balls. Oh, this is nice. - Hey, Gabe. - You left the lights on, dad. They turn off by themselves. See? Dad! Yeah, been having some trouble with that! Well, good night! Okay, mom. Well, I'm off to Ivy's for the weekend. Whoa. That's a pretty big suitcase you got there. Oh, Ivy and I are doing makeovers. We're, uh you You know us girls. Oh, well, before you go, come check out my blog. Oh, you have a blog. - Half a dozen Duncans. - Catchy, huh? The adventures of Amy Duncan, a mama bird whose nest is bursting with six crazy chickies. Mom, you only have five kids. I made one up. Skippy. - Skippy Duncan. - Mmm. Skippy Marie Duncan. She's eight. You are an interesting woman, mom. Thank you. Thank you. And oh my goodness, this Skippy is a handful. Last night because she was afraid of the dark, she set off a bunch of fireworks. Boy, did that cause a ruckus. A very interesting woman. What happened? Did mom and dad kick you out because you did something horrible? Please say yes. Dude, I didn't do anything. This is my new room. Gabe, you can't live on the porch. - Why not? - Well, for one thing, there's no light. Porch light. There's no running water. Hose. What about a bathroom? Hello. You've got it all figured out, huh? Been so busy with your new room you forgot to get in trouble for your big brother. What are you so afraid to tell mom and dad? Can't say. It's bad. Oh, come on, it can't be that bad. Just tell me what it is. Okay, but you have to promise not to tell anybody. I promise. All right. Here goes. I dropped out of college. What?! Oh man, mom and dad are gonna kill you! You just said it wasn't even that bad. I didn't know what it was! Wait. Why'd you quit college? Because it's just it's just not for me. And there's something else I wanna do. Well, you'd better do it quick, because mom and dad are gonna kill you! You said that already! Well, when are you gonna tell em? I don't know. Soon, probably. There's a chance dad might be in some hot water with mom. I'm gonna wait and see how that plays out. Hey, can I use your bathroom? - Yeah, sure, go ahead. - Cool. - Oh, hey, hon. - Hey, sweetie. Look, babe, there's sandwich fixins over there if you're interested. That sounds Guh Guh? What does that mean? Nothing. What are you doing? Just stretching. Before you eat? It's pretty important. So what's bringing you to Boston? Well, hopefully this plane. No, actually, I'm gonna go visit my boyfriend. We're in a long-distance relationship. Ah. Well, you're sitting next to the right guy. I travel for a living and I've got tons of tips. First off, don't travel for a living. Seriously now, you're always gonna have to have one of these things handy. Well, it looks very comfortable. I always carry a spare. Thanks. Hungry? Uh, I guess. What do you got? Waldorf salad. Well, if that's all you got. Fresh ground pepper? Don't mind if I do. By the way, I'm Herb Pickier. Oh, Teddy Duncan. Nice to meet you. Tell me, Teddy, do you have any need for high-pressure gas flanges? Um, not at the moment. Oh. Well, take my card, anyway. You never know. I pretty much know, but thank you. So how long you gonna be in Boston? Oh, just for the weekend. I'm gonna surprise my boyfriend. I can't wait to see the look on his face. I'm going to Denver to surprise my girlfriend. I can't wait to see the look on her face. It's open. Surprise! This is crazy. But I don't know who you are. Ahem, um, is Spencer here? He's in Denver. He went to surprise his girlfriend. I'm his girlfriend. I came here to surprise him. Well, that was exciting for a second. Teddy. You're never gonna guess where I am. - Denver? - Huh. I thought that would be harder. Yeah, well, guess where I am. - Boston! - What? Well, I guess we both had the same idea. Surprise! Oh gosh, this is terrible. We're not gonna be able to see each other. Yes, we are. Okay, you stay right there. I'll just take the first flight back. Well, I mean I'm already at your front door. I might as well say hi to your parents. Don't. No no, what are you doing? They don't know that I'm out here. - Well, I just rang the bell. - Just move! Son, that is what we call ding-dong ditch. Hey, Charlie, wanna play a game? Okay, so I'm thinking of a number, and if you guess it, you get to have Toby move into your room. Nice try. Hey P. J. , you wanna play a game?. Still trying to find a bedroom, huh? Yeah, and I've tried everywhere The living room, the basement, the front porch. I assume you've ruled out the attic. Ugh! - The what? - The attic. Ugh! We have an attic? Yeah. It's upstairs. Yeah yeah, that'd be the place for it. Wait. Why didn't I know we had an attic? You didn't know we had a tree house either. You gotta start looking up. See? Ugh! It's not ugh! It'sHey! - Teddy! - Herb. Hi. Hey, how was your day in Boston? Not so good. Pillow me. Thanks. So My boyfriend decided to surprise me and flew out to Denver. Oh, the old double surprise gone bad. I could sing a few bars of that one. But you're not going to, right? No no, they frown upon that during the safety announcement. It's just that by the time I get back, Spencer I will barely have any time together. All long-distance relationships are brutal. You try to make em work. You email, you text, you video chat Then one night you decide you'd rather watch a Battlestar Galactica Marathon and suddenly you're the bad guy. I'm pretty sure that won't happen to me. Stay away from the first season. It's addictive. Good to know. All I'm trying to say is there's no substitute for being in the same place together, and anyone who thinks otherwise is just kidding themselves. Oh, except for you and your boyfriend. You kids'll be fine. This is the Captain speaking. Just wanna let you know that there's some weather over the Ohio valley, so we're gonna be a little delayed tonight Three, four hours tops. Wha well, here's a thought: Fly around Ohio. Well, looks like we're gonna be here for a while. Mini quiche? - Hey, mom. - Hey, P. J. Okay, she's sitting right there. Just Get it over with and tell her you dropped out of college. If you hold it in one more second, you'll go Ooh, grapes! When did we get those? Mom must've gone to the store. But she doesn't always wash them. Did I just eat an unwashed grape? What am I doing in the kitchen? Oh, right. Mom? There's something I gotta tell ya. Hello. Yeah, hold on. Uh, somebody from Good Morning, Denver wants to talk to you. Good Morning, Denver? The TV show? Yeah. I think I have a minute. Hello. This is she. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I I think I could arrange something. Oh, very good. Yes, thank you for calling. What's going on? I'm gonna be on TV! Wow, that's great, mom. They loved my mommy blog and they want me to do a segment on the show! And if it all goes well, be a regular. - They said that? - No, but they will! After I'm on TV. Well, I think that's all the ant traps. Okay. Well, by now the ants have done their job - and the termites are gone. - Sure hope so. Come on, 2,000 ants against two termites? I think I likes me my odds. Oh no, I it's termites! Dozens of em! How did they multiply so fast? Well, they are in the Duncan house. Kind of a when in Rome situation? Ah. We're gonna have to tent the house. What am I gonna tell Amy? You could tell her the truth. Or - A vacation? - Yes. Honey, you work so hard, you do so much around here you deserve a vacation. Well, okay. That sounds great. When were you thinking?. 8:00 A. M. Tuesday to 8:00 A. M. Thursday. 48 hours of fun! Just you, me, the kids and the perishables. Bob, Bob, I can't do that. I'm gonna be on TV Tuesday morning, remember? Oh, right. Um Okay, no problem. We'll leave right after you're done. Okay, sounds great. Hey, why are we taking the perishables? Because We Coming! - Finally. - Oh there's my girl. Hey, what time did you get in last night? 4:00 A. M. I am so sorry. The plane got delayed, quiches went cold, Herb only brought one side salad It was a complete disaster. Herb? Yeah, you'll probably meet him on the flight back. But the important thing is that we're together now. Well, for an hour. What? Yeah, I have to catch a plane. I've got class tomorrow. Well, great. So I have to wait until spring break to see you again? Oh. Gosh. My parents are coming to Boston for spring break. So we have one hour together in five months? Well, we can find a couple ofweekends to visit each other. No, Spence, I can't. My parents don't even know that I took this trip, I can't lie to them again. Well, what are we gonna do? I don't know. I didn't know it was gonna be this hard. Yeah, me neither. I just can't spend all my time missing you. I'm gonna drive myself crazy. Yeah, I feel the same way. What do we do? Well, I mean, there's nothing we can do, except I don't wanna say it. Yeah, I don't wanna say it either. I love you. Oh, I love you too. I'm gonna miss you so much. Why you so sad? Well because we're saying goodbye, Charlie, and It's a very hard thing to do. Then say, hello. Yeah. Yeah, maybe that's easier. Hello, Teddy. Hello, Spencer. Home sweet home. Oh! Gabriel Duncan, what is going on? This is my new room. I didn't think you knew about the attic. Well, the word gets around. It took 13 years, but it got around. Honey, you cannot turn the attic into your bedroom. You can't, but maybe I can. What? Well, I've been looking for something to talk about on TV tomorrow, and this is perfect! My house was too small, but I had a brainstorm. You had a brainstorm? Well, it sure wasn't Skippy. No no no. Hi, Teddy, remember me? Not now, P. J. Oh, I don't know any P. J. I'm Socky the sock puppet. Yeah, I remember. When you were little and feeling sad, I used to cheer you up. And that's what I'm here to do now. Let's turn that frown upside down! I don't think I can. Better let me handle this, Socky. Okay. I know it hurts, but trust me, this is the hardest part. I just miss him so much. It's gonna get better. It's gonna get better. I know because I've been through this. Remember when Skyler moved away? I thought my world was over but,somehow I managed to move on. You will too. Well, I just I don't want it to be over. Maybe it isn't. What do you mean? Maybe someday, when the timing's right You and Spence will be together again. Uh-oh, lint ball. Hey, there it is. There's that smile. Oh, Socky. When did my big brother get to be so wise? - When he dropped out of college.  - You did what?! I don't know what he's talking about. How you feeling, sweetie? You doing okay? I'm good, mommy. Oh, honey, I was talking to Teddy. No, I'm okay, mom. But don't worry about me. Today is your big day. Hey, mommy's gonna be on TV. Yeah yeah. Teddy, look, if you ever need to talk. - You know I'm here for you. - Thanks. Go ahead, tell her. Tell her you lied about the sleepover and went to Boston. Now's the perfect time. She's in a good mood and Ooh! Grapes. Yes yes, much better. Much better. Been wanting to get rid of that door for years. It really opens the space up. Bob, what is going on? Why do things keep breaking? Honey, things break. Happens all the time. The real question Is why weren't things breaking before? Thanks, Phil. And now let's say hello to mommy blogger Amy Duncan. - Good morning, Amy. - Good morning, Jan. And Good Morning, Denver. So what are you going to talk to us about today, Amy? Problem-solving, Jan. When your nest is as full as this mama bird's, you're always finding ways to make more room. All of my loyal readers know that my youngest daughter Charlie, shares a room with her sister Skippy. - Who?  - Shh! And that Skippy is quite a handful, isn't she? Oh, don't get me started, Jan. Anyway Now that baby Toby needs his own room, I have to find someplace to put my teenage boy, Gabe. And believe me, we tried everywhere The living room, the basement, even the front porch. And then it hit me Why not clear out the attic and convert it into a really cool loft space? Well, that's exactly what I did. It was a lot of hard work, but as I always say, a mama bird's job is to build the perfect nest. Could you hold this, Jan? Let's kick it back to the studio, Jan. No no no, I think we'll keep it right here. What just happened, Amy? Good question. Bob? Um, okay. Uh, you know those termites I brought home the other day? They kinda got out. You let termites eat our house? - I dropped out of college.  - What?! And I went to Boston without your permission. - What?!  - Wow! Mama bird, it looks like your nest is falling apart In more ways than one. What do you have to say? This whole thing is a disaster. Might as well tell her that Skippy's a lie too. Just go ahead. Just do it. And now for the weather. The skies are Sunny and clear. Back to you, Phil. Okay, you guys, come on. Come on, let's go. Shake a leg. I finally get my own room and now we have to move out. It's just for a couple of nights. We're gonna get the house checked out, make sure everything's safe Take care of the termite problem. I thought that was implied. And then we are gonna move back in and everything's gonna be back to normal. What do you mean, normal? - P. J. dropped out of college. - Teddy went to Boston. - Dad brought termites in the house.  - Well, Gabe - What did you do?  - Nothing. As usual, I'm the good one. Bob, this family is completely falling apart. No, it isn't. Look, guys, I dropped out of college for a reason. I want to go to culinary school. I'm good at cooking, I'm passionate about it and I look good in the hat. Okay, well, I feel better now that you have a plan. Yeah, well, as for you, young lady, you are grounded. You're gonna be spending a lotta time in your room. I don't have a room. Well, we're gonna find you a room and I'm gonna put you in it. All right. Come on, guys, let's go. - Can you  - Yeah. Thank you. Okay, house, see you in a couple of days. Or longer. Hi, Charlie, I'm back. Um, where was I? Oh, right worst day ever. So the whole house was eaten by termites and we don't have a place to live. Ugh. Yeah, it's a disaster. Well, not for you. You have your own apartment. Oh yeah. That makes me feel better. See ya. Well, the rest of us have no idea where we'll end up, but I'm sure we'll be fine. But just in case, wish us good luck, Charlie. - He was visiting BIPA.  - Whapa? BIPA, the bostotin Bostotin sorry. Okay, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good. - Whapa?  - BIPA, the bostonin BIPA, the Boston instit Whapa? It's all going so well. Hey, sweetie. Oh, there's some sandwich fictions if - I can't say that word. - Go back to one. I'm from the South. I should be able to say fixins. Well, for one thing, there's no light. Porch light. No. - Porch light's right here. - It's right there. So how's the long-distance relationship going? Not go There's, like, a motorcycle gang going by the set right now. I don't know I'm just kinda in shock. Yeah, me too. Who's ready for some delicious New England chicken noodle chowder? Shoulder bread?
Well, Charlie, here we are in our hotel room, and we're not on vacation. Confused? Well, get comfortable, because it's a doozy. Charlie, get out of the bathroom! In a minute! Hey. Come on, guys. Huh?. Not so bad. Kind of an adventure. - Oh, save it. - Be quiet! Shut up. Come on. I'm just trying to make the best of it. - Because you caused it. - Not totally my fault. - Then whose fault was it? - I'll get back to you on that. Ugh. Teddy, I need a hand. So how we got here is kind of a long story. Let's just say this is the worst day in Duncan family history. - Teddy, now! - I'm coming! To be continued. Oh. You hear that, Toby? It's called quiet. Enjoy it while you can, because in this house it doesn't last long. - Mom! - Hmm? Told you. Why is Toby's crib in my room? Because you two are sharing a room now. - We talked about this. - No, we didn't. We didn't? Oh, well, Toby and I talked, and he's fine with it. I I can't share a room with a baby. I'm a teenager now. I need my own space. Well, I'm sorry, honey, but we only have so many rooms. Besides, you love Toby. This isn't about love. This is about square footage. Well, if it makes it any easier, Toby's about the same age you were when you moved in with P. J. Yeah, but with me and P. J. , the little brother was in charge. That ain't happening with us. Oh aren't you adorable? Stop that, Gabe! Stay strong. Today's all burnt toast  Running late, and dad jokes Has anybody seen my left shoe I close my eyes, take a bite Grab a ride, laugh out loud There it is up on the roof I've been there, I've survived So just take my advice Hang in there, baby Things are crazy But I know your future's bright Hang in there, baby There's no maybe Everything turns out all right Sure life is up and down But trust me it comes back around You're gonna love who you turn out to be Hang in there, baby. Oh, hey, P. J. you are a good cook. Could you taste this and tell me what you think? Sure. Um What is it? Well, that's not a good question. It's New England clam chowder. Ah. Well, I'm not getting any chowder Or clams. Or even England. It is new, though. Oh man! I wanted to make Spencer a special welcome-home lunch. He was visiting BIPA. BIPA, the Boston Institute of Performing Arts. He's hoping to go there next Fall. There he is. Hey, um, do you think you could rescue this? - No problem. - Thank you. Step one. Oh! I'm so glad you're home. - So how was BIPA? - Supa. It's how they say super in Boston. I know. Hey, you wanna hear how they say, go park your car in Harvard Yard? Pahk your cah in hahvahd yahd. Supa. Mine's better. So hey, how was it? Oh my gosh, the school is amazing. - I mean, I loved it. - That's awesome. So when do you find out if you got in? I already found out. They accepted me. Way to go, boyfriend! Oh yeah, uh-huh. Why am I the only one doing a happy dance? Well, because because there's one other thing. Um, they want me to start a little early. Well, like how early? Monday. - What?  - Yeah, it's called early enrollment. They have a space available and if I want it, I have to take it right now. But you haven't finished high school. Yeah, I know, but I already have enough credits to graduate. Wow. This is Wow. Hey, Teddy I haven't made my decision yet. I mean, I wanted to talk to you first. What do you think? I don't know. I'm just kind of in shock. Yeah, me too. Who's ready for some delicious New England chicken noodle chowder? Denver Omelet? Guys, guys, I had an unbelievable day at work. Wait until I tell you what happened. Oh, I think I hear Toby. Baby's right there. - Oh, then I think I hear Charlie. - Charlie's at a play date. I'm trying to get out of a bug story, work with me here. Okay. So I'm doing a routine spray job over at the Andersons' They have a monthly maintenance package, so that means I go every other Tuesday. So the first Tuesday is perimeter, the second Tuesday's interior. - I think I hear the doorbell. - Oh no, you don't. Anyway, long story short - I captured these bad boys. - Ugh. Huh? Brazilian termites. Very rare, very destructive and they've never been found in North America Until now. Well, if they're so destructive, why would you bring them into our house? Our wooden house? Honey, I'm not an idiot. This container termite-proof. - Are you sure? - I am sure. Besides, it's only gonna be for one night. Tomorrow I'm taking em to the University of Denver. This could land me in the exterminator hall of fame. Bob honey, that doesn't exist. Honey, yes, it does. It's in Detroit. Used to be in Cleveland, but they had to move it. Rat problem. So I know that it's a great opportunity, but if Spencer leaves now, I'm gonna be so sad. We have so many plans for the rest of the year. When I get a boyfriend, we're gonna make bunch of plans too. Maybe you should make a plan to get a boyfriend. Maybe you should make a plan not to tell me to make a plan. Volleyball friends, huh? Well, one problem at a time. So Spencer asked me what I thought he should do And I don't know what to tell him. I think if you're lucky enough to get a boyfriend, you should never ever let him go Even if you have to lock him in the basement and not tell anybody. So Of course I don't want Spencer to go, but I also don't want to be the one to keep him from going. Oh man. I wish I had some experience with these things, but for some reason boys find me weird and off-putting. Not just boys, sweetie. Kelsey, what do you think? I think whatever happens is gonna be great. But if Spencer goes, then Teddy will be crushed. - You make a good point. - And if he doesn't go, - he might be miserable. - That's a good point, too. So what are you saying? That I agree with everybody. But you can't agree with everybody. You are absolutely right. You just did it again! Okay, I've made my decision. - What is it? - I need some new friends. My little Deedee just loves playing with your little Charlie. Oh. Although, last time she asked me, why does Charlie have a boy's name? And I didn't know what to tell her. Hey, honey. How's your play date going? - Eh. - Mmm. Follow up question: Where's Deedee? In jail. Final question: What does jail mean exactly? Uh, well, it means, we'd better go check. Oh, my. Oh. Oh, Deedee. - Not funny. - Oh, sorry. - Oh. - Yeah, you guys go play. Maybe we should just stay in here with the girls for a while. - Sounds like a good idea. - Okay, sure. Well, at least this will make a good post for my blog. Uh, you have a blog? I call it Mama Debbie's Daily Doing's. Oh, you're serious. You betcha. I post recipes, offer helpful hints Share fun things Doug Dooley and I do together. Just passing along some of the things I've learned about motherhood and such. Wow, and you've based this on your vast experience with one child? And one on the way for a total of two. Oh. I have a total of five. It's not a competition. It wasn't. - What are you doing down here? - Toby kept me up all night. Ah. It's called payback. When you were a baby, you used to make my life miserable, too. I will never forget the night I woke up in your crib and you were in my bed. I still have no idea how you did that. Well, me and Toby sharing a room is not gonna work. Something has to be done now. Oh! Are you gonna do something bad? Because that'd be great - For me. - What are you talking about? Well, I have to break some difficult news to mom and dad, and they're not gonna be happy. So I was thinking maybe if you got in trouble, I could sneak my news in and kind of piggyback on your badness. Well, what's the news? Oh, it's nothing. You know, I'd get it out of you, but I am way too tired. So what do you think? You gonna be getting into trouble anytime soon? I don't know. It's different. I'm a teenager now. Well, what kind of attitude is that? That is quitter talk. Brazilian termites. This is the most exciting thing since I discovered those Ukrainian grub worms in 06. Excuse me, I discovered those. No, I was in the crawl space. You were in the port-a-john. Fine. Here. Feast your eyes on those little beauties. I don't see em. - Well, they're in there. - Are you sure? All I see are two little holes. Holes?! Oh no. No no no! They ate right through the plastic! Oh, this is bad. This is really bad. Okay, look, we gotta wipe em out before they multiply More importantly, before Amy finds out. Well, we could tent the place. Hey, there you go. She'll never notice a giant gas-filled tarp covering the house. Well, then what are we gonna do? I've got an idea. To the bug mobile! I love when he does that. Hey, sweetie, can you go get me the jail? Mommy needs to do laundry. - Okay. - Thank you, sweetie. Hi, Charlie. Hey, mom. - Hey, sweetie. - What you doing? Working on my mommy blog. Mommy blog? That doesn't sound like you. I am gonna kick Debbie Dooley's butt. That sounds like you. The only problem is I'm having trouble coming up with topics. What kind of stuff does Debbie post about? - Recipes - Ooh, so that's out. She also writes about fun stuff she does with her husband, so that's out too. Hey, where is Gabe? He's always up to something? Well, here's hoping. I mean for you and your blog. Not for me. Why would I need him to do anything bad? Coming! - Hey. - Hi. - So listen, I - So, Teddy, I - You first. - Okay, um I'm just gonna come out and say it. I think you should go to Boston. Because I was kinda leaning towards not going. - Why? - I just don't think I can leave you. Oh, Spence, but BIPA is your dream school. It's the best musicprogram in the country and you know if you don't grab this opportunity, you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life. Yeah, but it's not the only college out there. I mean, I could stay here and audition for the Denver Institute of Performing Arts. - DIPA? - Yeah. DIPA's not as good as BIPA. Oh yeah? You know who went to DIPA? - Kelly Ripa. - Ripa went to DIPA? No, I just wanted to hear you say that. Hey, you know you have to do this. Yeah, but what about us? Well, there will still be an us, just a long-distance us. - You really think we can make that work? - Hey, nothing is far away anymore. We can we can text. We can talk on the phone. We can video chat. We can email. Oh, and the great part is that when I smell funny You won't have a clue. - Hey, you never smell funny. - I know. It's gonna be okay, sweetie. We can do this. Yeah, of course we can. So when do you have to leave? Tomorrow. Okay. Then come here. Until tomorrow, I'm not gonna let you go. Me neither. Hey, it's kinda cold out here. You wanna go inside? Sure. Okay, my hungry little ants Today's special is Brazilian. Bon Appetit. - Dad? - Ow! - P. J. ! - Why are you releasing ants in the house?. Uh, because I'm training. Uh, I'm uh, letting the ants go now so I can catch em again later. All the exterminators do it. Dad, do you think it's fair to say I'm not the brightest Duncan? It it's more than fair, son. So if I'm not buying this story, who do you think will? All right, look, um Those Brazilian termites that I brought home? They got out, so I brought in some ants, because the ants will eat the termites. See? So it's gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be fine. Why don't you just tent the house? Because I don't want your mom to find out. Because if mom found out, that'd be bad. That would be very bad. But she's not gonna find out. Right, right. Uh, but when she does, could you let me know? - Why? - Just because. It's not like I have something to hide. Coming! - Hello? - It's open! - What is this? - It's my new room. No, it's not. Then what's my bed doing here? Gabe, you are not taking over the living room. It's not the living room. It's the fireplace area. Oh yeah, that makes me feel better Gabe With fire in his room. Now pack it up! That's what I get for answering the curtain. It's so good to see your face. I know it's only been a few days, but I miss you so much. I miss you too. And I'm sorry we haven't been able to talk very much it's just With orientation and everything It's okay. I get it. Teddy, can you give me a hand with Toby? Be right back. - Hey, Mr. Duncan. - Oh!. Spencer? What are you doing on the computer? Oh, just video-chatting. Hey, how about that? You see the butt scratch? Yes, Sir. I had an itch. Oh no, I completely understand. It's just Well, after the scratch you picked up an apple. Then you put it back. Well, yeah, I just I realized I was in the mood for cereal. Not really the point. - Okay, I'm back. - See you. Finally, we're all alone. Hello. Except for Charlie. - Hi, Charlie. - How did he get in there? Charlie, Spencer's not really in the computer. He's in Boston. - Can you see me? - I sure can. I just can't see your sister. Yeah, just chilling in my new room, dude. Yeah, I'm loving it. Um, I'm gonna need to call you back. No, the spin cycle just started. This might be a problem. - Hi. - Hi. Just thought I'd pop over and tell you, - I saw your blog. - Oh. And I especially enjoyed your first post, that darn Carlie. So important to proofread. Oh. Well uh, thank you. And next time you have any helpful suggestions, don't come over. Yeah. Just feel free to put it in my comments section. Oh, that's thoughtful. Mm-hmm. Well, I always enjoy telling you where to put things. Mmm. Since I'm here now, let me give you a few tips. I call them Debbie Dooley's dos and don'ts. Do use spell-check. Don't not use spell-check. Do know that my blog will always be more popular than yours. Don't think it won't. Okay. That's great. That's great. Though, you know, I have some helpful hints myself. Yeah. Do go back to where you came from. Don't bother me again. So how's the long-distance relationship going? Not good. You know, we both have such different schedules, we barely had any time to talk. Told you you should've locked him in the basement. I know it's only been three days, but I miss him so much. I just wish I could see him. So why don't you? Fly all the way to Boston by myself? My mom and dad would never let me do that. Unless they didn't know about it. You could just tell them that you're spending the weekend at my house. That's good. I like that. So this weekend, we'll be at Your house. Yeah, sleepover at Ivy's! It's not really happening. Yeah, it's not really happening. I'll bring the I'll bring the popcorn balls. Oh, this is nice. - Hey, Gabe. - You left the lights on, dad. They turn off by themselves. See? Dad! Yeah, been having some trouble with that! Well, good night! Okay, mom. Well, I'm off to Ivy's for the weekend. Whoa. That's a pretty big suitcase you got there. Oh, Ivy and I are doing makeovers. We're, uh you You know us girls. Oh, well, before you go, come check out my blog. Oh, you have a blog. - Half a dozen Duncans. - Catchy, huh? The adventures of Amy Duncan, a mama bird whose nest is bursting with six crazy chickies. Mom, you only have five kids. I made one up. Skippy. - Skippy Duncan. - Mmm. Skippy Marie Duncan. She's eight. You are an interesting woman, mom. Thank you. Thank you. And oh my goodness, this Skippy is a handful. Last night because she was afraid of the dark, she set off a bunch of fireworks. Boy, did that cause a ruckus. A very interesting woman. What happened? Did mom and dad kick you out because you did something horrible? Please say yes. Dude, I didn't do anything. This is my new room. Gabe, you can't live on the porch. - Why not? - Well, for one thing, there's no light. Porch light. There's no running water. Hose. What about a bathroom? Hello. You've got it all figured out, huh? Been so busy with your new room you forgot to get in trouble for your big brother. What are you so afraid to tell mom and dad? Can't say. It's bad. Oh, come on, it can't be that bad. Just tell me what it is. Okay, but you have to promise not to tell anybody. I promise. All right. Here goes. I dropped out of college. What?! Oh man, mom and dad are gonna kill you! You just said it wasn't even that bad. I didn't know what it was! Wait. Why'd you quit college? Because it's just it's just not for me. And there's something else I wanna do. Well, you'd better do it quick, because mom and dad are gonna kill you! You said that already! Well, when are you gonna tell em? I don't know. Soon, probably. There's a chance dad might be in some hot water with mom. I'm gonna wait and see how that plays out. Hey, can I use your bathroom? - Yeah, sure, go ahead. - Cool. - Oh, hey, hon. - Hey, sweetie. Look, babe, there's sandwich fixins over there if you're interested. That sounds Guh Guh? What does that mean? Nothing. What are you doing? Just stretching. Before you eat? It's pretty important. So what's bringing you to Boston? Well, hopefully this plane. No, actually, I'm gonna go visit my boyfriend. We're in a long-distance relationship. Ah. Well, you're sitting next to the right guy. I travel for a living and I've got tons of tips. First off, don't travel for a living. Seriously now, you're always gonna have to have one of these things handy. Well, it looks very comfortable. I always carry a spare. Thanks. Hungry? Uh, I guess. What do you got? Waldorf salad. Well, if that's all you got. Fresh ground pepper? Don't mind if I do. By the way, I'm Herb Pickier. Oh, Teddy Duncan. Nice to meet you. Tell me, Teddy, do you have any need for high-pressure gas flanges? Um, not at the moment. Oh. Well, take my card, anyway. You never know. I pretty much know, but thank you. So how long you gonna be in Boston? Oh, just for the weekend. I'm gonna surprise my boyfriend. I can't wait to see the look on his face. I'm going to Denver to surprise my girlfriend. I can't wait to see the look on her face. It's open. Surprise! This is crazy. But I don't know who you are. Ahem, um, is Spencer here? He's in Denver. He went to surprise his girlfriend. I'm his girlfriend. I came here to surprise him. Well, that was exciting for a second. Teddy. You're never gonna guess where I am. - Denver? - Huh. I thought that would be harder. Yeah, well, guess where I am. - Boston! - What? Well, I guess we both had the same idea. Surprise! Oh gosh, this is terrible. We're not gonna be able to see each other. Yes, we are. Okay, you stay right there. I'll just take the first flight back. Well, I mean I'm already at your front door. I might as well say hi to your parents. Don't. No no, what are you doing? They don't know that I'm out here. - Well, I just rang the bell. - Just move! Son, that is what we call ding-dong ditch. Hey, Charlie, wanna play a game? Okay, so I'm thinking of a number, and if you guess it, you get to have Toby move into your room. Nice try. Hey P. J. , you wanna play a game?. Still trying to find a bedroom, huh? Yeah, and I've tried everywhere The living room, the basement, the front porch. I assume you've ruled out the attic. Ugh! - The what? - The attic. Ugh! We have an attic? Yeah. It's upstairs. Yeah yeah, that'd be the place for it. Wait. Why didn't I know we had an attic? You didn't know we had a tree house either. You gotta start looking up. See? Ugh! It's not ugh! It'sHey! - Teddy! - Herb. Hi. Hey, how was your day in Boston? Not so good. Pillow me. Thanks. So My boyfriend decided to surprise me and flew out to Denver. Oh, the old double surprise gone bad. I could sing a few bars of that one. But you're not going to, right? No no, they frown upon that during the safety announcement. It's just that by the time I get back, Spencer I will barely have any time together. All long-distance relationships are brutal. You try to make em work. You email, you text, you video chat Then one night you decide you'd rather watch a Battlestar Galactica Marathon and suddenly you're the bad guy. I'm pretty sure that won't happen to me. Stay away from the first season. It's addictive. Good to know. All I'm trying to say is there's no substitute for being in the same place together, and anyone who thinks otherwise is just kidding themselves. Oh, except for you and your boyfriend. You kids'll be fine. This is the Captain speaking. Just wanna let you know that there's some weather over the Ohio valley, so we're gonna be a little delayed tonight Three, four hours tops. Wha well, here's a thought: Fly around Ohio. Well, looks like we're gonna be here for a while. Mini quiche? - Hey, mom. - Hey, P. J. Okay, she's sitting right there. Just Get it over with and tell her you dropped out of college. If you hold it in one more second, you'll go Ooh, grapes! When did we get those? Mom must've gone to the store. But she doesn't always wash them. Did I just eat an unwashed grape? What am I doing in the kitchen? Oh, right. Mom? There's something I gotta tell ya. Hello. Yeah, hold on. Uh, somebody from Good Morning, Denver wants to talk to you. Good Morning, Denver? The TV show? Yeah. I think I have a minute. Hello. This is she. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I I think I could arrange something. Oh, very good. Yes, thank you for calling. What's going on? I'm gonna be on TV! Wow, that's great, mom. They loved my mommy blog and they want me to do a segment on the show! And if it all goes well, be a regular. - They said that? - No, but they will! After I'm on TV. Well, I think that's all the ant traps. Okay. Well, by now the ants have done their job - and the termites are gone. - Sure hope so. Come on, 2,000 ants against two termites? I think I likes me my odds. Oh no, I it's termites! Dozens of em! How did they multiply so fast? Well, they are in the Duncan house. Kind of a when in Rome situation? Ah. We're gonna have to tent the house. What am I gonna tell Amy? You could tell her the truth. Or - A vacation? - Yes. Honey, you work so hard, you do so much around here you deserve a vacation. Well, okay. That sounds great. When were you thinking?. 8:00 A. M. Tuesday to 8:00 A. M. Thursday. 48 hours of fun! Just you, me, the kids and the perishables. Bob, Bob, I can't do that. I'm gonna be on TV Tuesday morning, remember? Oh, right. Um Okay, no problem. We'll leave right after you're done. Okay, sounds great. Hey, why are we taking the perishables? Because We Coming! - Finally. - Oh there's my girl. Hey, what time did you get in last night? 4:00 A. M. I am so sorry. The plane got delayed, quiches went cold, Herb only brought one side salad It was a complete disaster. Herb? Yeah, you'll probably meet him on the flight back. But the important thing is that we're together now. Well, for an hour. What? Yeah, I have to catch a plane. I've got class tomorrow. Well, great. So I have to wait until spring break to see you again? Oh. Gosh. My parents are coming to Boston for spring break. So we have one hour together in five months? Well, we can find a couple ofweekends to visit each other. No, Spence, I can't. My parents don't even know that I took this trip, I can't lie to them again. Well, what are we gonna do? I don't know. I didn't know it was gonna be this hard. Yeah, me neither. I just can't spend all my time missing you. I'm gonna drive myself crazy. Yeah, I feel the same way. What do we do? Well, I mean, there's nothing we can do, except I don't wanna say it. Yeah, I don't wanna say it either. I love you. Oh, I love you too. I'm gonna miss you so much. Why you so sad? Well because we're saying goodbye, Charlie, and It's a very hard thing to do. Then say, hello. Yeah. Yeah, maybe that's easier. Hello, Teddy. Hello, Spencer. Home sweet home. Oh! Gabriel Duncan, what is going on? This is my new room. I didn't think you knew about the attic. Well, the word gets around. It took 13 years, but it got around. Honey, you cannot turn the attic into your bedroom. You can't, but maybe I can. What? Well, I've been looking for something to talk about on TV tomorrow, and this is perfect! My house was too small, but I had a brainstorm. You had a brainstorm? Well, it sure wasn't Skippy. No no no. Hi, Teddy, remember me? Not now, P. J. Oh, I don't know any P. J. I'm Socky the sock puppet. Yeah, I remember. When you were little and feeling sad, I used to cheer you up. And that's what I'm here to do now. Let's turn that frown upside down! I don't think I can. Better let me handle this, Socky. Okay. I know it hurts, but trust me, this is the hardest part. I just miss him so much. It's gonna get better. It's gonna get better. I know because I've been through this. Remember when Skyler moved away? I thought my world was over but,somehow I managed to move on. You will too. Well, I just I don't want it to be over. Maybe it isn't. What do you mean? Maybe someday, when the timing's right You and Spence will be together again. Uh-oh, lint ball. Hey, there it is. There's that smile. Oh, Socky. When did my big brother get to be so wise? - When he dropped out of college.  - You did what?! I don't know what he's talking about. How you feeling, sweetie? You doing okay? I'm good, mommy. Oh, honey, I was talking to Teddy. No, I'm okay, mom. But don't worry about me. Today is your big day. Hey, mommy's gonna be on TV. Yeah yeah. Teddy, look, if you ever need to talk. - You know I'm here for you. - Thanks. Go ahead, tell her. Tell her you lied about the sleepover and went to Boston. Now's the perfect time. She's in a good mood and Ooh! Grapes. Yes yes, much better. Much better. Been wanting to get rid of that door for years. It really opens the space up. Bob, what is going on? Why do things keep breaking? Honey, things break. Happens all the time. The real question Is why weren't things breaking before? Thanks, Phil. And now let's say hello to mommy blogger Amy Duncan. - Good morning, Amy. - Good morning, Jan. And Good Morning, Denver. So what are you going to talk to us about today, Amy? Problem-solving, Jan. When your nest is as full as this mama bird's, you're always finding ways to make more room. All of my loyal readers know that my youngest daughter Charlie, shares a room with her sister Skippy. - Who?  - Shh! And that Skippy is quite a handful, isn't she? Oh, don't get me started, Jan. Anyway Now that baby Toby needs his own room, I have to find someplace to put my teenage boy, Gabe. And believe me, we tried everywhere The living room, the basement, even the front porch. And then it hit me Why not clear out the attic and convert it into a really cool loft space? Well, that's exactly what I did. It was a lot of hard work, but as I always say, a mama bird's job is to build the perfect nest. Could you hold this, Jan? Let's kick it back to the studio, Jan. No no no, I think we'll keep it right here. What just happened, Amy? Good question. Bob? Um, okay. Uh, you know those termites I brought home the other day? They kinda got out. You let termites eat our house? - I dropped out of college.  - What?! And I went to Boston without your permission. - What?!  - Wow! Mama bird, it looks like your nest is falling apart In more ways than one. What do you have to say? This whole thing is a disaster. Might as well tell her that Skippy's a lie too. Just go ahead. Just do it. And now for the weather. The skies are Sunny and clear. Back to you, Phil. Okay, you guys, come on. Come on, let's go. Shake a leg. I finally get my own room and now we have to move out. It's just for a couple of nights. We're gonna get the house checked out, make sure everything's safe Take care of the termite problem. I thought that was implied. And then we are gonna move back in and everything's gonna be back to normal. What do you mean, normal? - P. J. dropped out of college. - Teddy went to Boston. - Dad brought termites in the house.  - Well, Gabe - What did you do?  - Nothing. As usual, I'm the good one. Bob, this family is completely falling apart. No, it isn't. Look, guys, I dropped out of college for a reason. I want to go to culinary school. I'm good at cooking, I'm passionate about it and I look good in the hat. Okay, well, I feel better now that you have a plan. Yeah, well, as for you, young lady, you are grounded. You're gonna be spending a lotta time in your room. I don't have a room. Well, we're gonna find you a room and I'm gonna put you in it. All right. Come on, guys, let's go. - Can you  - Yeah. Thank you. Okay, house, see you in a couple of days. Or longer. Hi, Charlie, I'm back. Um, where was I? Oh, right worst day ever. So the whole house was eaten by termites and we don't have a place to live. Ugh. Yeah, it's a disaster. Well, not for you. You have your own apartment. Oh yeah. That makes me feel better. See ya. Well, the rest of us have no idea where we'll end up, but I'm sure we'll be fine. But just in case, wish us good luck, Charlie. - He was visiting BIPA.  - Whapa? BIPA, the bostotin Bostotin sorry. Okay, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good. - Whapa?  - BIPA, the bostonin BIPA, the Boston instit Whapa? It's all going so well. Hey, sweetie.

No. - Porch light's right here. - It's right there. So how's the long-distance relationship going? Not go There's, like, a motorcycle gang going by the set right now. I don't know I'm just kinda in shock. Yeah, me too. Who's ready for some delicious New England chicken noodle chowder? Shoulder bread?
Peek-a-boo. I see you. Yeah yeah yeah. Oh. Peek-a-boo. I see you. Yeah. Ready ready? Peek-a-boo! I see you. I just realized there's no end to this game. Woo-hoo! Let me guess. You're gonna be on TV again. Oh! I can't believe it. Good Morning, Denver Called. They want me to do another segment. Really? After what happened last time? Yeah. Turns out, a house falling down is actually good TV. Question is, how am I gonna top it? Okay, mom. I have some good news too. - Oh really? What's going on? - This is so exciting. So you know how Yale is my first choice of colleges? Yeah. They've scheduled an alumni interview for me right here at the house. I mean, it doesn't mean that I'm in for sure, but it definitely means that they're interested. And if it goes well, it's a really big plus. That's great. You having trouble focusing? I'm gonna be on TV. Today's all burnt toast{\i0} Running late and dad jokes.{\i0} Has anybody seen my left shoe?{\i0} I close my eyes, take a bite{\i0} Grab a ride, laugh out loud.{\i0} There it is up on the roof.{\i0} I've been there, I survived.{\i0} So just take my advice.{\i0} Hang in there, baby{\i0} Things are crazy.{\i0} But I know your future's bright.{\i0} Hang in there, baby{\i0} There's no maybe.{\i0} Everything turns out all right.{\i0} Sure life is up and down.{\i0} But trust me, it comes back around.{\i0} You're gonna love who you turn out to be.{\i0} Hang in there, baby.{\i0} You want to get that? And interact with people? No thanks. - Hi. - Hey. I'm Lauren. I'm new to the neighborhood and I'm looking for babysitting jobs. And I heard you guys have lots of babies. Oh, that we do. But it also means that I have a lot of free babysitters. Dad dad dad. Shouldn't we keep our options open? - Hi. I'm Gabe. - Hi. I'm Lauren. I probably should interview her just to make sure she meets our high standards. Can't just let anybody babysit for, uh - Toby? - Toby, right. Yeah. Thank you. So, Lauren, how long have you been babysitting? About a year. Okay. All right. Follow-up question. Do you have a boyfriend? What does that have to do with babysitting? Oh, I'm interviewing for something else now. Oh. In that case, I don't have a boyfriend. Do you have a girlfriend? I'm working on it. You're cute. I am, aren't I? So, you're new to the neighborhood, huh? Yeah, I'm staying with my grandmother for a while. I can't wait to meet her. You already have. Oh no! Oh yes. Let's go, Lauren. This is the one I warned you about. This is the Devil Child? But he seems so nice. That's what makes him the Devil Child. Hey, people change. - Oh, hey, PJ. - Hey, sis. So, I have a question for you. Where are you going to be tomorrow at 3:00 pm? Now I have an answer for you. Anywhere but here. Why can't I be here? Because a guy is coming over to interview me for Yale, and so I want the house to myself. Because you're ashamed of me? Not just of you. Everybody. Oh. Well, that makes me feel a little better. All right. I guess I can not be here tomorrow. Great. Thanks. Oh, although I was gonna watch my cartoons tomorrow at 3:00. Can't you just skip a day? Can't you just skip your college interview? Why is your stuff more important than mine? Because mine involves Yale, and yours involves a turtle with a suitcase. It's a briefcase, and it's a portal to another dimension. I'm begging you. Please don't be here tomorrow. All right. I'll make other arrangements. Thank you. Got an interview for Yale. Grow up. Hey. Hey. What do we have here? Well, one of my kids finally wanted to see where daddy works. So, Charlie, what do you think? Can we go now? Charlie, we just got here. Oh. You want to sit in daddy's chair? It spins around. - Okay. - Okay. - Can I go next, boss? - We've been over this, Vern. So, what have we got lined up for today? Same as yesterday. Nothing. What? Man, what I don't get it. Why is business down? I mean, we just put out new advertising. Charlie, look. Huh? - What do you think? - That's scary, daddy. It's not scary. It's clever. Oh, you just can't read yet. You don't realize this is a pun, see? Daddy's all dressed up like a boxer. So I'm gonna knock out your bug problems. Boxers knock things out. Oh, that is clever. - PJ, what you thinking about? - I've got a problem. I'm trying to figure out where to watch my cartoons tomorrow at 3:00. How about your place? No, because Emmett's gonna be watching his cartoons then. Boy, you think you have a problem then you hear something like that. What's your problem? Well, I like this girl, but it turns out her grandmother's Mrs. Dabney. - Ooh. Oh. That is bad. - Yeah. Normally, I'd have nothing to do with anyone related to Dabney but, Lauren has that one quality I've never really found in a girl before. - What's that? - She likes me. Sounds like one of a kind, man. You should go for it. You know what? You're right. Here goes nothing. Oh hey, while you're there, will you find out if Mrs. D will be watching Yacky the Duck Tomorrow at 3:00? - Is Lauren here? - Yes. Can I see her? About what? That's between me and her. Right now what's between you and her is me. So start talking. - Hi, Gabe. - Hey, Lauren. Do you want to go roller skating tomorrow? Can I, grandma? And now it's back to me. Pretty please? Oh, all right. - Thanks. - Yes. What time will you be picking us up? Us? Well, I'm not gonna let you two go unchaperoned. You date her, you date me. Fine. I'll be by tomorrow around 1:00. Will you be taking us out for cheeseburgers? Don't push it. Wear something cute. - Good morning, Vern. - Look what I found. The old me. Big boy Bob, as the guys in the break room used to say. The only guys in the break room are you and me, Vern. I guess I said it to myself. Why is he here? Well, I've been thinking. We used to get a lot of jobs when this guy was the face of the company. But then This guy came along. And as your little girl said, he's scary. He's also in shape. I think the new Bob is frightening the customers. This guy you want in your house. He's warm, he's cuddly, he's gonna eat some cookies, maybe take a nap on your couch. I only did that once. But this guy, he's tough, he's menacing, he's gonna kill the bugs, but then what? Now he's got a taste for blood. Oh, that's ridic what are you saying, Vern? You want me to put the weight back on? Oh no no. Of course not. Nobody's saying anything like that. No no. Oh, lookie here. An ad for an all-you-can-eat buffet. And us with nothing to do. Okay. Hello. I'm Lionel Van Ness. Yale 85. Hi. I'm Teddy Duncan. Yale 18. If all goes well. Can we start over? Hello. I'm Lionel Van Ness. Yale 85. Please, make yourself comfortable. Listen, I know these interviews can be intimidating, but I just want you to relax, be yourself. We're just two people talking. Sounds good to me. So, Teddy, what made you think about Yale? Oh well, there are so many reasons. But if I had to pick one, I guess I'd say I have a thing for bulldogs. It's the mascot. Oh, hi. What's going on here? I told you. My college interview. Oh, right. I'm sorry. I'm Amy Duncan. Teddy's mom. Hello, Lionel Van Ness. Nice to meet you. Uh, mom, what are you doing? I'm sitting in. You won't even know that I'm here. That's all right with you, isn't it, Lionel? Well, it's a bit unusual, but I guess it's okay. Great. Come on in, boys. What is going on? Okay, let's go back to where you greet each other like you never met, okay? And with good energy. What is all this? Oh, I'm sorry, Lionel. Allow me to explain. I'm a local TV personality. And I'm filming a segment for my show Good Morning, Denver. And you two are gonna be on it. No, we're not. My sweet Teddy. She's so beautiful, it's hard to believe she's camera shy. Mom, could I have a quick word with you in the kitchen? - Sure, Sweetie. - Yes. Be right back. Hey Ken, could you get him into a different shirt? One that goes with my eyes? - What are you doing?! - I'm killing two birds with one stone. Teddy, I need a new segment for my show, and you need help getting into Yale. Mom, how is this helping? Having your interview on TV is gonna make you stand out. And if I happen to win a local emmy as well, well, it's a win-win. Mom, this is really important to me, so just please don't blow it. I'm not gonna blow it, okay? I just need five minutes. I'll get a couple of quick shots and I'll be on my way. Five minutes, but that's it. Thank you, honey. Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. One more thing, if you could find some time to mention the phrase um Rick's Diner, quality you can taste that would be too much? Okay. So. We having fun yet? - No. - Good. Oh, hey, guys. PJ! What the heck are you doing here? At the roller rink unexpectedly. Oh, hello, Gabe. I just came by to roller skate. As I often do this time of day. As long as you're here, you can chaperone us, and Mrs. Dabney can go home. Do you really think I'd leave my granddaughter with Devil Child and Devil Child's dimwitted brother? Don't worry, Mrs. Dabney. Gabe and I will be here too. Okay, new plan. You keep Dabney occupied so I can get some alone time with Lauren. - Alright you got it little bro. - Thanks. I will not let Mrs. Dabney out of my sight. I lost her. - This is nice, huh? - Yeah. Oh, I think it's a couples' skate. So I think we're supposed to hold hands. Well, if we have to. If we have to. Oh no you don't. And now it's triple skate. Found her. Also, I've always been interested in writing, and I know that Yale has a great English Department which, um Is actually what drew me there in the first place. You know, I've considered a career in in journalism and possibly Teaching. You're breathing on my neck. Honey, it's for the camera. It's called a two-shot. Are you getting this, Ken? What would you consider your greatest challenge? Oh, you mean besides this? I have to say choosing the right major. Because I have so many different interests. - It's gonna - You know, if I may, Lionel. I think what Teddy's trying to say is that, she has been drawn to Yale because she wants to follow in her mother's footsteps. Oh, did you go to Yale? I thought about it. But then I chose Southwest Denver Community College. The jewel of The Rockies. You know, Yale's just been done to death, so. Getting back to Teddy uh, tell me about your extracurriculars. Uh, well, I've always had a passion for theater. - It's - I have a question. You're gonna want to go tight on this, Ken. As a concerned mother, I want to know about your meal plan. I am not gonna send my daughter all the way across the country if she doesn't have balanced nutrition and I'm sorry. I can do so much better. Let's just do that again. - As a concerned - Stop it! - What? - Your five minutes are up. You're done. - Teddy, I'm just trying to help. - Who? Who are you helping? Because it's not me. Guys, could you turn the camera off. Just take five. I did it again, didn't I? I'm sorry, Teddy. I'm so so sorry. I just sometimes I want to be on TV so bad that I lose my head. Yeah, well, it's over. So Mr. Van Ness, I'm Very sorry that we wasted your time. I know this thing has been a complete disaster. And I'm never going to Yale. Actually, I'm very impressed with you. Your grades are excellent, you're well-rounded, and now that I know you've accomplished everything under such difficult circumstances I'm gonna recommend you. Really? Well, that's amazing! You're welcome! - What's going on, boss? - We're doing a photo shoot, Vern. Oh, we're finally gonna do that calendar? The men of Bob's Bugs Be Gone. Dibs on baby new year. Yeah, I'm gonna need a minute to get that image out of my head. No, I was thinking about what you said. About how the customers think I'm scary. - What about it? - Maybe you're right. So you know what? We should do new shots. Make me look friendly and lovable, so that people will want me in their house killing things. Brilliant. Let's do it. S-s-super star. Big star going far, there you are. S-s-super star. S-s-super star. Look so bright. Livin' right. Here all night. S-s-superstar. This isn't working, is it? Too bad you don't have a puppy. Nobody can resist those little guys. Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I got something even better. Now we're talking, boss. Hey, I even have a new slogan. I'll protect your house just like it's my own baby. Love it. So how do I look? - Getting my smile okay? - I'm getting everything I need. Oh wow. I forgot how much fun dating can be. If you ask us out again, we'll probably say yes. All right, Mrs. Dabney, let's see what you got. Oh no. I gotta keep my eye on these two. Oh, I get it. You don't got any moves. Oh, it's gonna be like that, huh? All right. You two, hands to yourself. I gotta take PJ to school. - Let's go. - Okay. Wow, Mrs. Dabney, you move pretty well for an old School skater. Why did you pause? I Sometimes do that. You know, I was once in an ice skating contest where I picked Gabe up and twirled him over my head. Not gonna happen. Oh, neither I nor the laws of gravity were suggesting it. Sometimes you're smart, sometimes you're dumb. It's hard to keep up. I just want you to know that no matter what your grandmother says, I'm not a bad guy. Maybe I like bad guys. - Ready to kick it up a notch? - Try and stop me! No! Hey, Charlie. So piece of advice, when it's time for your college interviews, just go to them. Don't let them come to you. You know what? Actually, this applies to everything. Playdates, sleepovers, first dates. Basically any social interaction. Can you do that somewhere else? I'm hurting over here. Gabe's a little cranky. He went on a date and had a little mishap. A mishap? I went looking for love and got a face full of Dabney. Wish him good luck, Charlie. Peek-a-boo. I see you. Peek-a-boo! I see you. Man, I'm so sick of this game. And this guy seems to love it. Peek-a-boo. I see you. Oh, there's a new twist Not. Peek-a-boo! I see you. Anything but this. Wheels on the bus? Itsy bitsy spider? Something? Peek-a-boo. I see you. Check, please?! 3 o'clock. Time for Yacky the Duck. Oh, thank goodness. Oh, I've seen this one already. Huh? No no no no no. It's worth another look. There's nuance, subtlety, there's Peek-a-boo. I see you. Oh, Aah!
Hey, girls. Whatcha you doing? Oh we're making a list of all the fun things we want to do together before we go to college. Kind of like a bucket list except instead of dying, we're graduating. Oh okay. Well, what do you have so far? The word List. I came up with that. I have the perfect idea for you girls. How about you take a ride in a hot-air balloon? Ooh, that sounds good. Yup. Then again, I am afraid of heights. And I'm not crazy about balloons. Okay, how about watching the sunrise from the top of Pike's Peak. Oh, I've always wanted to do that. Of course we'd have to get up pretty early. And I bet it's cold up there. 0 for 2, ma. Okay, why don't you two come up with something? Road trip. Road trip. That's sounds like fun.

We take catch pretty seriously. Are you playing baseball behind my back? Not anymore. Why would you do that? Because, Mom, every time you watch me play, you yell, you scream, and get totally out of control. That doesn't sound like me. Yes, it does. I can't believe you're playing secret baseball. It's only a secret to you. See ya. Charlie, honey, you'd never play a sport behind my back, would you? - No, Mommy. - That's my girl. Hey, Charlie, you ready for T-ball practice? Hey!

Look, if you let me go to your game I promise, that I will be so quiet you won't even know that I'm there. What do you think, Toby? Should I trust her? No. Don't listen to him. He's one. And yet he's probably right. So We've played Pinochle. Now what do you guys want to do? You tell us, best man. He should have planned more activities. He's dropping the ball. Just so you know, old guy whispering is just like young guy talking. Your best man has a lot of tude. Well, I better get upstairs and make some more sandwiches. Uh, you need some help with that? No, you come up with your own excuse. So you You guys were postal workers, huh? Exterminator. He's more boring than the son. Right lane ends. Watch for falling rocks.

Ivy, this is the only place in the whole country where four states connect at one single point. Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico. Oh, Harry! Oh, you've done it again! I know. It doesn't get much more exciting than this. Ivy, could I talk to you for a second? Sure, which state would you like to see me in? Hey! How are the sandwiches coming? Couple more minutes. Hey, Mrs. Dobbs. What are you doing here?. - I have to talk to you. - Is everything okay? Oh, P. J. , I have to confess a terrible secret. You see, I was married before. Well, that's not that much of a secret since your name is Mrs. Dobbs. - Let me finish. - Mm hmm. My first husband did all the cooking, so I never learned how. But Bert raves about your cooking. That's because I secretly order takeout, and then serve it as if I made it myself. Oh, hey, my Mom used to do that Back when she still cared. I came over because I know you're going to cooking school and I was hoping you could teach me a few things. Sure, I'd be glad to give you a few lessons. I just hope Bert doesn't see me come over here. Well, if he does You just tell him I'm teaching you how to tap dance. Yeah. I'll think of something. Smile, Teddy! Mrs. Wentz, if you want me to smile, you might want to, stand in front of the part of me that smiles. Got it. Oh, how's the weather in Arizona, Mary Lou? Well, it's sunny and oh, Harry! Gotcha! Well, this was Can we get going now? Right you are, Ivy. Onto our final destination, Las Vegas, New Mexico. Um, you mean Nevada. Oh, no, no, no, no. That Las Vegas has been done to death.

The rough-rider museum. The world's largest cactus. Ivy, did you know about this? I don't recall. Really? Because I'll tell you what I recall. First, you came up with the idea for the road trip, then you lured me into the R. V. ,. and then you conveniently left out the crucial New Mexico Part about Las Vegas, New Mexico. Ivy, you didn't tell Teddy we were going to New Mexico? She didn't tell me we were leaving the driveway. Harry, if Teddy doesn't want to be on this trip, we should go home. What?! No Rough Riders? No big cactus? We can come back another time. Come on, honey. Dad, what are you doing? Seeing what it feels like to have my heart broken in four states. Why you doing that? Because bases are loaded, and Gabe is up to bat, and I promised I'd stay calm. - Strike one! - What?! Are you out of your  Zip code? Because if you are, welcome to the neighborhood. Strike two! You stink, ump. What? It was Charlie. I thought you weren't gonna tell your Mom you were playing. Yeah, I gave it my best shot. Strike three! What?! Are you kidding me?! On what planet is that considered a strike? You are the sorriest excuse for an ump I've ever seen! You think you can do better? - Yeah. - Fine. I thought you changed. I did Then I changed back. Thank you. Now this Is what we call a spoon. Say it with me now, Spoon. Can we speed this up? The wedding's tomorrow. Hey, what's going on here? A five, six, seven, eight. I came over to give my best man the rings, but it seems like there's something going on here. Bert, there's something I have to confess. I I can't cook. You've been lying to me all this time? I'm sorry. Well, sorry's not good enough. The wedding's off. This is awful. What am I going to do? Oh, I have an idea. That was just the timer, but I do have an idea. Bert, wait. Wait, Bert. - You're making a huge mistake. - My mind's made up. She lied to me and I can't forgive that. Come on, everyone makes mistakes. Did she lie? Yes. Did that hurt the trust? Yes. Am I bad at these kinds of speeches? Yes. But but But, Bert, there's a woman in there who is learning how to cook just for you. Now who else is gonna go to that much trouble to make you happy? That's all I ever wanted, Bert; To make you happy. You can't cook anything? I can boil a hot dog. Well, okay, the wedding's back on. T I'm so sorry I tricked you. I just really wanted you to come along. Everything's more fun when you're around, always has been ever since kindergarten. We met in preschool But go on. I just wanted to spend some time with you. We're both going away to different colleges soon and things are gonna change. Well, Ivy, we're always gonna be best friends. I know, but It won't be the same. I'm gonna miss you so much. I'm gonna miss you too, T. And just so you know, everything's more fun when you're around too. This last day was a bad example, but generally speaking. Believe it or not, I'm even gonna miss them.

Mommy's the ump. I know. Well, Charlie, I went to Las Vegas New Mexico. And I'd tell you all about the trip, but as they say, what happens in Vegas Is nothing. But it doesn't matter because I was with my best friend, which means we had a lot of fun. Oh, hey, check this out. So by the power vested in me by the website Five Minute Minister.

And have you been a good girl? Eh. Your honesty is refreshing. What would you like for Christmas? Oh, that's good. Okay. Merry Christmas, Charlie!. Um, okay, so, what did you ask Santa for? He knows. He's Santa. Um, actually, he's just one of Santa's helpers. The real Santa is up at the North Pole. So, you can tell me what you asked for. It's a secret. Okay, um, hang on a second. Stand right here. Okay? Uh, excuse me, Santa? Oh, oh, listen, buddy, there's a weight limit on this ride. I'm sorry. I wanted to talk to the Santa that was just here. He'll be back this afternoon. We like to put on fresh pants every couple hours. It's my first time on the subway. And me without a balloon. There's some of that New York humor I've heard so much about. Uh-huh. It's my first time in the city. Or as you natives call it, The Big Apple. So, you don't have a book or a magazine or Actually, could you tell me what stop I need to get off at? I'm trying to get to NYU. Oh. Here's what you wanna do. Take this all the way to the end of the line, get off, get on another train going the opposite direction. More of that trademark New York humor? Nope. You're going the wrong way. You know, George, now that I've been hanging out here for a while I have a question. They are 67% beef. That wasn't the question. Oh, good. I was fudging the numbers. You're out here for hours. What do you do when you have to go to the bathroom? Well, I try not to think about it. 'Cause if I think about it then I have to go. And now I'm thinking about it! Watch the cart! I'll be back. Wow. It's all mine. Oh, and that's hot! Uh, one kraut dog, no kraut. Skyler? PJ\NPJ? Hi. What are you doing here? Teddy's taking a tour of NYU. We're just here for the day. And you got a job? It's just temporary. - So, how are you?  - Um, great.

Okay. I didn't find out what Charlie wanted for Christmas. - What?  - Well, she whispered it to Santa. And then she wouldn't tell me. Well, did you ever think about asking Santa? I tried to, but by then, Wise Guy Santa had replaced Fresh Pants Santa. Honey, it's crazy down there. Okay, as usual, I have to handle it myself. I'm just gonna go down there and talk to him. They won't let you talk to him unless you got a kid. Gabe! - What?  - Let's go. You're talking to Santa. All right. Let me just shave, I'll be right with you. Excuse me? Did you, uh, did you catch any of that? Oh, yeah, he said [Mumbling] I was wondering what that meant. There is a temporary minor delay, but we're gonna be moving shortly. Whew! Well, that's good news. No, it's bad news. Why? You're not from New York, are you? No. How did you know? 'Cause you don't speak subway. Temporary minor delay means we're not going anywhere for a long, long time. Should be moving shortly means I'm not kidding. A long, long time. But if it's not true, then why would they say that? Oh, because he wants everyone to remain calm. Well, it's not working! This is not good. I need to get to NYU. This train needs to start moving Now! If you click your heels three times, I'm sure we'll be on our way. Hey, I have to get somewhere, too. I have a very important audition. Yeah, the difference is, she might actually get into NYU.

Lasagna. And it's for a Christmas party I'm going to. We could have a party right now! Sit. Um, listen, while we're stuck here, would you mind running lines with me? Why not? Okay, so we're at a very fancy country club, and you're having tea with your friends. - Cue me in. - Okay. I've spent all my summers in Southampton.

Okay, let's do this one standing up. I think that might be best. Tell me your name, little Man. Gabe. I want cash. Next! Hi, Santa. Uh, my little girl was here a few hours ago. Here's a picture of her. Uh, actually, that's a picture of you. Oh, sorry about that. Let me just get one of her. That's me. Me, me Oh, here she is. With me. Do you remember what present she wanted? Yeah. It was a doll. - Are you sure?  - Or a pony. Okay, now I feel like you're just trying to get rid of me. It's always a doll or a pony. Once in a while you get a kitten or a bike. Dolls and ponies those are your mainstays. I don't care about that! I want to know what she wanted! It's Christmas Eve! I'm running out of time, and I've got to know! Ma'am, you're a little out of control. The holidays can do that to people. No. It's not just the holidays. Okay. So, I want Christmas to be perfect. Is that so wrong?. Joe, we got another holiday stress case. - Is there a problem? - Yes, there's a problem. It's Christmas Eve and everything is falling apart! I hear what you're saying. Now, let's go to Candy Cane Village, have some nog and talk about our feelings. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah, I think that might be best. Hey, George. What? You sold a dog with no kraut. I can see it in your face. I didn't mean to. It was for my ex-girlfriend. No exceptions! Everybody gets kraut! Except for Mr. Billy Joel! Piano Man gets it any way he wants. I'm sorry, when I saw her, I realized I hadn't really gotten over her. - And did you tell her this?  - No. I choked. I just let her walk out of my life again. Well, PJ, I think you should find her and tell her how you feel. She sounds like a very special girl. How am I going to do that? We're in the middle of the biggest city in the world. There's got to be, like, 10 million people in the Oh, there she is. - Hi, PJ.  - Look, I'm really glad you came back, 'cause I got to tell you something. The minute I saw you, I knew I was still crazy about you. That's why I came back, too. I just finished talking to the kebab guy around the corner Oh, Ezra? He's my cousin, and very wise in the ways of love. He helped me realize that I'm still crazy about you, too. - Really?  - Really. Now that I have you back in my life, I'm never gonna let you go. Actually, I have to go. My family and I are driving to Maine for Christmas. So this is it? I'm afraid so. I mean, you'll be in Denver, and I'll be off to college. - Where are you going?  - Denver University. Will you write me? Oh, every day. I think I can help. You're going to school in Denver? Yeah. And you live in Denver. Oh! Yes, I'll hold. More tea? More tea? I will trade you one piece of lasagna for a ride on a private jet. That's right, I can make that happen. More tea. See? Now it sounds like I'm saying Morty. Yes. Hi. Um, I was supposed to take the tour today at 2:00. But, um, I'm I'm stuck in the subway. So Hold on. Excuse me, I'm sorry, but I'm trying to make an important phone call here. Yeah, and I'm practicing my audition. So keep it down. Seriously, could you knock it off? More yeah, see! Now\Nyou made me forget my line! Oh, come on! Give me a break! I'm not gonna ask you again! - If you hit that  - Everyone, stop it! Okay, I know we're all stressed out, but are you forgetting it's Christmas Eve? Christmas is not about auditions and college tours. It's about peace on Earth, good will towards men. I guess what I'm trying to say is Hand over that lasagna! Zuri's right. I'm not handing over anything! What are we getting so upset about? It's Christmas. If I don't make it to NYU, maybe it wasn't meant to be. Yeah. And maybe me getting that part wasn't meant to be. You say that every time. They don't need to know that! As long as we're stuck here, might as well make the best of it. Yeah, maybe what this car needs is a little Christmas spirit. Mr. Steel Drum Man, if you would. We wish you a Merry Christmas. We wish you a Merry Christmas. We wish you a Merry Christmas And a happy new year! We wish you a Merry Christmas. We wish you a Merry Christmas. We wish you a Merry Christmas And a happy new year! Charlie! Charlie, you won't believe it. A special visitor just came down the chimney. Hello-ho-ho Charlie. Santa, what are you doing here? Well, I get so many requests from kids That sometimes I forget what they asked for. I'm not 500 years old anymore. Ho ho! Ho! Oh, Santa, stick to the script. Why don't you come over here and sit on Santa's lap. No. Ho, ho! Why not? Because you're Daddy. No! No, ho, ho, ho. I'm Santa. Then why are you wearing Daddy's shoes? Okay, Sweetie. You can go now. Great! Now what? Honey, relax. Have some nog It's Christmas Eve. She gets to open a present tonight,and we don't know what she wants! Honey, take it easy. It's not worth getting all upset about. Who are you? Joe, the Elf, he taught me a lot today. Did you know that you can't spell self without Elf? What does that mean? I don't know, but it really calmed me down. - Hey, PJ.  - Hey, how was NYU? Never made it. Long story, I'll tell you later. So, how was your day? Well, I ate a bunch of hot dogs and I got back together with Skyler. How did that happen? Well, after the first four, I had to take a nap, then Skyler. Oh, right. I'll, tell you on the plane. If you're going to Denver, you're not going to Denver. There's a big blizzard over The Rockies. The airport is closed. Teddy, what are we gonna do? Wait a minute. Uh, I met this girl on the subway and she gave me her number. Hello. Hi, um, I'm Teddy, who is this? The Butler? We are so staying there. Can I open my special present now? Yeah, yeah do, uh, do we have a special present for Charlie? The big one! Oh. Okay. Okay. Open it. A doll house! I told you Santa knew! Honey, how did you know what to get her? I was going to ask you the same question. - What? If you didn't get it  - No. And I didn't get it, then who? Come on. It was me. Oh, uh, for a minute there we were thinking it was Santa. That's impossible. Everybody knows that Santa doesn't come until we're asleep. So, you used your own money to buy Charlie a doll house? How did you know? She's only been talking about it for a month. And with Teddy and PJ out of the house, I realized I needed to step up and be a A good big brother. It's a Christmas miracle. Ewe, stop! Stop. Stop. Stop. Hey, Charlie. Well, even though we're not all together for Christmas, I gotta say, it's kind of cool being in New York. - It's a pretty magical place. - Maybe for you. Hey, it's the lasagna lady. - How was the party?  - I didn't go. I traded the lasagna for a jet ride, and then she never called me back! Tough town. More caviar, please. Oh, not that much, you fool. And draw my bath. - PJ, what are you doing?  - Oh, I'm practicing. I've never had a Butler before. Well, this should be interesting. Bring me my slippers. I know I don't live here, don't you talk back to me. Well, Merry Christmas and wish us all good luck, Charlie. What do you think is in here? I don't know, but whatever it is, I'm guessing it's about to throw up. Am I wrong, or is Zuri really pushing her luck with Santa? Make sure to hang that one on a sturdy hook. Coal is very heavy. I can't believe you invited up two complete strangers from off the street. No good can come of that. That's how I wound up living here. Exactly. Hey, it's Christmas Eve! Quit being such a Scrooge! So, what did you get the kids for Christmas? I don't know. I just put my name on all the gifts you got em. Just for that, you are gonna help me set up a Christmas treasure hunt for them. How am I supposed to put my name on that? Hey, guys! Hello, Jessie. Hi, everyone. - This is my brother, PJ. - Hey. This is Ravi, Emma, and Luke. Welcome to our humble home. I guess in New York, humble means palace towering over the city. My parents say thanks again for letting us stay here. We feel really bad intruding on your Christmas Eve. Aw, well, we wouldn't want you to feel bad. Ignore our Butler. Hospitality is not really his thing. How odd. Do you also have a Chef who hates to cook? Yeah. Same guy. The kids were actually just about to open their Christmas Eve gifts. Has everyone picked out a present? Well, I have now. Luke Ross, trust fund recipient. Is he the one you warned me about? Mmm-hmm. He's the reason we can't have mistletoe anymore. What in the silver bells happened here? Okay, who tried to wrap me? Hey, why was I sleeping on the floor? And who's playing the piano from the inside? Luke? Oh! That explains why I dreamed about flossing. We've all dreamed about you flossing. Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out. Ow! Ow! Ow! Yeah! What happened to our tree? And why am I the only thing under it? OMG! All our presents are gone! That's weird. I've never heard of Santa taking away presents! How naughty were you two? Guys! Remember that cool chemistry set I opened up last night? - No. - Nerd. Neither do I. But I woke up a few minutes ago, and I made some troubling discoveries. Actually, I don't remember anything that happened last night after Teddy and PJ got here. Yeah, the last thing I remember is freckles here hitting on me. And my last memory is you saying you'd go out with me. Worth a try. Why can't any of us remember last night? Judging from my notes, it appears I mixed a compound which exploded into a toxic vapor. That put us to sleep and caused a retroactive memory blackout. Sincerest apologies from myself and the Little Edison Toy Company. Okay, um, not to add another problem to the list, but has anyone seen my brother? No, but do you have a sister? It's in there! It's big, it's scary, and when I woke up, it was nibbling on me! - The lizard?  - The Butler? Whoa, it's a reindeer! I thought it was a moose! Nice reindeer. Please tell me you're on a break and Santa's on his way to pick you up! Yes, Dad, we're having a great Christmas. They even have a reindeer. Right, uh, yeah, of course, a plastic one. A real one would be bizarre and frightening. Good boy, Prancer. More like Biter, or Kicker. We looked everywhere, but we could not find any presents. Not even socks. At this point, I'd be happy with an acrylic sweater. Santa, if you're listening, I didn't mean that! Okay, we need to figure this out before your parents get home. We'll split into two teams. Boys, you sift through the wreckage for anything that might help us remember what happened last night. And, as we sift, we will also dust and put away! I seriously need to change teams. PJ, you're in charge. Really? Cool! Ravi, you're in charge. Ugh! I can't believe I have to clean up your stupid chemistry set on Christmas. Stop crying over spilled magnesium citrate, and help us find some clues about what happened last night! Hey guys, I think I found our first clue! Why do you say that? Because this paper says, your first clue. Ooh! Dibs on reading it! Welcome to your Christmas treasure hunt. What a whimsical holiday treat. Sure, it is fun to just get a present, but hunting for it is much more pleasant. Someone hid our presents? What kind of sicko would do that? Okay, Shawn's heading for the restroom, so we've got about five minutes to check last night's security footage. He had Taco Queen for breakfast. We've got at least 20. We need to figure out what happened after you and PJ got here last night. Yeah, and who let a reindeer up unannounced. If you knew our door staff, you wouldn't be surprised by that. Just keep looking for the monster who stole our presents! Okay, no reindeer or monsters yet. That's a giant Elf. That's no Elf, that's our Butler! It was Bertram? I always knew he was part Grinch! He's stealing presents from children? It does not get any lower than that. Whoa, it looks like he didn't act alone. Jessie? Okay, forget about the lowest. It's not like anybody died. We haven't seen the rest of the tape. It was you? You stole our presents? I don't know why I would Oh! Now I remember! I wanted to give you guys a Christmas treasure hunt, so I hid all your presents. Sounds fun, right? Not as fun as finding them under the tree! And opening them in our jammies, as Santa intended! Okay, guys, relax. We'll just go get the presents. Great, where are they? I have no idea. Oh, someone's about to get Jack Frosted up! Why didn't you just hide them in the apartment? Yeah, that would have been smarter. Okay, who invited her? Let me at her! Zuri, aren't you the same girl who was just on the subway yesterday preaching peace on Earth? All I know is, I don't have my presents, so I need something to rip open! Okay, guys, calm down! Let's just empty our pockets and purses and see if anything jogs my memory. Nope. All I have is my emergency change of jewelry. All I've got is my walking around cash. Well, um, I've got nothing, but dibs on checking your couch cushions! Okay, ball of lint, certificate for a full-body eucalyptus wrap, and a receipt for a locker rental in Central Park. I gave you that certificate months ago! You're a thief and ungrateful! Well, excuse me for not wanting to spend five hours just to smell like a koala snack! Wait, this receipt is dated December 24th. For locker number 339 at the skating rink. Maybe I put the presents in there! Then what are we doing here? Let's go! Um, guys, uh, we're not taking the reindeer with us, right? Of course not, that would be silly. Sean, would you mind watching our dog? Bye, Spot. I think he bought it. Oh, there is the 12th clue! All right. Now you have come to the glorious stage, where the answer is found in the reptile's cage. Oh, reptile! This one's easy. Wait! Mrs. Kipling does not like strangers in her cage. I got I got it! Whew! Wow, there's a lot of unexpected wildlife in this apartment. Okay, final clue. Don't rush off, stop and think. Your presents are in a box by the rink. It must mean the ice skating rink in Central Park. Yes! Ravi, you're brilliant! Let's go! Oh! Uh, on the way, can we stop and pick up a tourniquet and a pint of O-negative? Here it is! Locker 339! Okay, I have the combination. Balance due 25 cents? Does anyone have a quarter? Here, I have one. Okay Bertram! What are you doing in there? Trying to keep my elbow out of my gall bladder! Jessie, last night, you were supposed to come right back for me! - Why didn't you?  - Uh, I have no idea! None of us have any memory of last night. Must be nice! I spent the entire night wedged inside this stinky locker! I'll never be able to go to the gym again. Again? Don't you even start! Wait, why are you trapped in there? Aw, did Santa give you a time-out? Jessie, this is all your fault. The kids were asleep when we left, so I don't understand why we had to wear these stupid costumes. I just wanted to see if you'd actually put it on. Now I have next year's Christmas card! Come on, let's go home. Uh-oh, it's Zuri! What is she doing not in bed? Why don't you ask her nanny? Oh, right. Just hide! I don't want my Christmas surprise to get spoiled. - Where?  - In there! There! There, there! Go. Go, go, go! Come on, move farther back! I can't! What do you think is back here, Narnia? I know Jessie and Bertram are here somewhere. I saw them sneak out with all the presents! Okay, we've been wandering around so long, I am starting to recognize all the rats. Can we please go back home? Hey, I don't know how you roll in that Podunk hill town, but here in New York, we get what's ours. Okay, Denver is not a Podunk hill town. We have a pro football team, and our own omelet! Call me when you have two football teams, and Jay-Z. All right, Bertram, they're all gone, you can come out now. Uh-oh. What does uh-oh mean? It locked automatically, and I need a quarter to get you out! Go ahead, splurge. I'll pay you back. I don't have a quarter! Okay, I'll run home to get one, and be right back. Just try to relax, and breathe through this. Oh, thanks. Oh, wait, where did you get this straw? From the trash. Then you never came back! I was stuck in here with a moldy salami sandwich! I don't see a sandwich. Don't judge me! You didn't live through what I did! Okay, the presents are in one of these lockers! We know, Sherlock. Oh, hello, Bertram. Merry Christmas. Aw, you must have followed my Christmas treasure hunt! Indeed we did, and what a delightful romp it was! Delightful? I was almost eaten by a dragon! And the presents aren't even for me! My dad always hid my Christmas presents. He said, You never get anything in life without working for it. Except presents! That's the whole point! You know, I actually think a Christmas treasure hunt is very inventive. Thank you, Teddy. You're from Colorado. You think electricity is inventive. Zuri! You loved Colorado when we went skiing there last year. Oh, that was Colorado? I thought that was Switzerland. Well, in my defense, it's very easy to fall asleep on a private jet. You're a very annoying little girl. Bertram, which locker are the presents in? They're in the locker right next to me. The combination is in my pocket, if you'll - It's in his pocket! - just help me out of here. - Got it!  - Okay, come on, come on. Oh. Wha We need a quarter. Sorry, I'm all out. Well, why don't you break one of your hundreds? I have one in my pocket, if you'll just - Let me out of here!  - He has a quarter! Kids, be careful! I think this might qualify as a mugging. Found it! Jackpot! Yeah! I knew you'd have fun on my treasure hunt! Well, all's well that ends well. Get me out of here! You know, now that Bertram explained everything, it's all starting to come back to me. Yeah, me, too. But I still feel like we're forgetting of something. And there it is. Guys, I just found the weirdest thing! Second weirdest. Suddenly, Zuri and Teddy being wanted for reindeer-napping makes perfect sense. What, so you two stole the reindeer? Huh, there's a sentence I never thought I'd say. I don't remember stealing a reindeer! But it sounds like something someone from Denver would do. - Zuri, that's enough!  - We don't do that! Maybe a little innocent reindeer-tipping, now and then, but It says Prancer was supposed to be a part of the charity concert in the park today. You mean, that deer can sing? Oh, you two are going away for life! Jessie, why do we have to confess? Why can't we just release Prancer and run? Yeah, for once, I agree with her. It's a Christmas miracle. Yeah. Aw, look at that sad little pen. Oh, now I remember why we took him! Yeah, yeah, me, too! After we couldn't find you and Bertram last night, we saw Prancer locked up in that prison, so I decided to take him home. And you went along with that? I had a tough choice to make. Either face an angry, snorting beast or the reindeer. Prancer! Thank goodness! Where was he? Uh, weirdest thing. We found him - We found him in our building. - In the Statue of Liberty. Wait a minute. You two stole Prancer! I'm calling the cops! Okay, okay! We did it. But you wouldn't send three sweet, young girls to jail, would you? Uh, not three! I'm innocent! And they're really sorry. Sorry won't raise money for the kids. Or put toys in their donation bins. But you've got Prancer back now, and you're still having the charity concert, right? Wrong! After Prancer went missing, our singer, Joey Fatone, helped search for him. He was out there all night, calling Prancer's name, and by this morning, he lost his voice. And his watch. He was mugged. Wow, way to bring down the room. She could still call the cops. Dial it back. So now the charity event has their reindeer back, but they don't have a singer. Zuri, I am so disappointed in you. I can't believe you stole a reindeer without me! That was on my bucket list! As long as I'm not on it. I can't believe we came so close to meeting the Joey Fatone. Guys, the point is, this event was going to help a lot of kids have a happy Christmas, and now that's not going to happen. And it's all our fault! I feel terrible. We were so upset when we could not find our presents. Imagine how these kids will feel when they do not get any. There's got to be something we can do. Wait! I just got the greatest idea! You can sing at the charity concert, which will attract a huge crowd of toy-givers, thereby saving the day? Actually, I was gonna say we do an emergency bake sale, but I like your idea way better! Jessie, thank you so much for offering to sing for the charity. You can sing, right? Like a bird. And she looks cuter than a partridge in a pear tree! Thanks. I just wish we had more than three peeps a watchin'. Yeah, it's not the turnout we expected, but at least we'll get a few toys. More than a few! Look. Look at all the presents! Jessie, we thought about what you said, and we realized we've only been thinking about ourselves this Christmas. So we want to donate all of our presents to the toy drive. You do? That is so sweet of you. I am so proud of you guys! Well, we already have so much. And, you know what? Not being selfish feels really good. Aw, Luke. Wow, look what was tucked in with these socks! An Amazon river cruise and zip-line adventure! Still proud. Merry Christmas,everybody! Please welcome the very talented, hopefully, Jessie Prescott. Even if she stinks, please donate more toys! Thank you.
