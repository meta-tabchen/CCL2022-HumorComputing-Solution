"But then you peed on PJ and I thought,",S01E01,406
"Hey, give the kid a shot.",S01E01,407
"Look, someday you're gonna feel the same way",S01E01,408
a bout Charlie that I feel about you.,S01E01,409
"Well, how do you feel about me?",S01E01,410
Let's put it this way--,S01E01,411
"The hottest guy in school is at our house right now,",S01E01,412
And I'm here with you.,S01E01,413
Look how cute she is.,S01E01,414
I am warming up to her already!,S01E01,415
"Okay, Charlie's asleep, Gabe's playing a video game",S01E01,416
And we are finally alone.,S01E01,417
"Hey, everybody!",S01E01,418
I have a bruised coccyx.,S01E01,419
"Oh, come on!",S01E01,420
That's a funny word.,S01E01,421
Coccyx!,S01E01,422
The doctor gave him pain medication.,S01E01,423
Was that me? Sorry.,S01E01,424
I'm a little numb down there.,S01E01,425
"Uh, actually, that's my ride.",S01E01,426
Of course it is.,S01E01,427
"It's good to meet you, son.",S01E01,428
"Oh, good night, sweetheart.",S01E01,429
"Good night, sir.",S01E01,430
- Good night.,S01E01,431
- Good night.,S01E01,432
Coccyx!,S01E01,433
So that's how dad got my first kiss,S01E01,434
And how you flew for the first time.,S01E01,435
But the good news is--,S01E01,436
"Nah, there is no good news.",S01E01,437
I take that back! It's a text from spencer!,S01E01,438
He wants to hang out with me tomorrow night,S01E01,439
At his house!,S01E01,440
Oh! I've gotta go wash your puke out of my jacket.,S01E01,441
"Oh, and, uh, one more thing--",S01E01,442
"When you're my age and you meet a cute boy,",S01E01,443
"Do not, under any circumstances,",S01E01,444
ever ever bring him home.,S01E01,445
"Cause if you do, well--",S01E01,446
"Good luck, Charlie.",S01E01,447
"Oh, that's wonderful.",S01E01,448
Thank you so much for doing this.,S01E01,449
"Hey, if I can't be there for my patients,",S01E01,450
What kind of pretend doctor am I?,S01E01,451
"So, uh, do you ever think about shaving--",S01E01,452
"Like, everywhere?",S01E01,453
I did-- last week.,S01E01,454
"Hi, Charlie.",S01E02,0
It's Teddy here.,S01E02,1
So right now you're nine months old,S01E02,2
and everything is going great.,S01E02,3
"Well, almost everything.",S01E02,4
"Now what I'm about to show you is kind of disturbing,",S01E02,5
So brace yourself.,S01E02,6
"Mmm, these sandwiches will be yummy wummy.",S01E02,7
"Yes, they will, yes, they will.",S01E02,8
Mom and dad have been talking like that ever since you arrived,S01E02,9
"And if it's not over soon, I'm gonna go crazy wazy.",S01E02,10
- PJ! - what?,S01E02,11
What are you listening to?,S01E02,12
I downloaded a podcast on the history of ballet.,S01E02,13
- you like that? - More than baby talk.,S01E02,14
Would you like some fishy wishies with your cookie wookie?,S01E02,15
"Yes, I would, yes, I would.",S01E02,16
"Wait, guys, Charlie isn't even here.",S01E02,17
"No, widdle baby take a nappy wappy upstairs.",S01E02,18
So why are you guys still talking like that?,S01E02,19
I don't weawy know.,S01E02,20
I guess we're just kinda fried.,S01E02,21
"Well, we work all day, take care of a baby all night.",S01E02,22
"Work shift, baby shift",S01E02,23
I've barely got time to make doo-doo,S01E02,24
"Well, when was the last time you guys had a night out?",S01E02,25
"You know, like just the two of you-- like a date?",S01E02,26
Teddy made a funny.,S01E02,27
A funny wunny.,S01E02,28
Seriously! you know what? it's saturday night.,S01E02,29
"You two, you go out, have fun,",S01E02,30
"And do something besides work,",S01E02,31
take care of the baby and make doo-doo.,S01E02,32
"Well, it's nice to dream,",S01E02,33
but who's gonna take of Charlie,S01E02,34
Hello! you've got three great babysitters right here.,S01E02,35
I'm glad I didn't hear that.,S01E02,36
"I don't know, Teddy. It's a really nice thought,",S01E02,37
But we're really not ready to go out without Charlie just yet,S01E02,38
- You guys want to see a magic trick? - Sure!,S01E02,39
- Okay.,S01E02,40
- Prepare to be amazed.,S01E02,41
I could use a night out.,S01E02,42
Today's all burnt toast{\i0},S01E02,43
"Running late,and dad jokes{\i0}",S01E02,44
Has anybody seen my left shoe{\i0},S01E02,45
"I close my eyes, take a bite{\i0}",S01E02,46
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud{\i0}",S01E02,47
There it is up on the roof{\i0},S01E02,48
"I've been there, I've survived{\i0}",S01E02,49
So just take my advice{\i0},S01E02,50
"Hang in there, baby, things are crazy{\i0}",S01E02,51
But I know your future is bright{\i0},S01E02,52
"Hang in there, Baby{\i0}",S01E02,53
There is no maybe{\i0},S01E02,54
Eveything turns out all right{\i0},S01E02,55
Sure life is up and down{\i0},S01E02,56
"But trust me, it comes back all around{\i0}",S01E02,57
You're gonna love who you turn out to be{\i0},S01E02,58
"Hang in there, Baby{\i0}",S01E02,59
"All right, you guys have fun.",S01E02,60
Stay out as late as you want.,S01E02,61
But not too much fun-- We have enough kids already.,S01E02,62
I'm serious.,S01E02,63
"Okay, everyone, be good, have fun, love you.",S01E02,64
- Yeah yeah.,S01E02,65
- All right.,S01E02,66
"Hey, Teddy, thanks for doing this.",S01E02,67
It's gonna be nice for your mom and I,S01E02,68
to have some special time together,S01E02,69
"- Bob, move your butt! - I'm coming!",S01E02,70
"All right, so we divide it up evenly,",S01E02,71
We each get to spend an hour with Charlie.,S01E02,72
Who wants to go first?,S01E02,73
I think you should go first.,S01E02,74
"And second and third, since this was your idea.",S01E02,75
"Hey, I'm not doing this all by myself.",S01E02,76
you guys have to help out.,S01E02,77
Fine.,S01E02,78
I'll go fourth.,S01E02,79
There is no fourth.,S01E02,80
I meant I shall go forth to the park to shoot some hoop.,S01E02,81
"You want to go to the park so badly,",S01E02,82
Then why don't you just take Charlie?,S01E02,83
What's a baby supposed to do at the park?,S01E02,84
"Babies love parks. you can show her the duck pond,",S01E02,85
"The blue sky, clouds.",S01E02,86
We're just gonna look at stuff? that's what TV is for.,S01E02,87
"Yeah heh hah, all right!",S01E02,88
This is great. Whee!,S01E02,89
"Yes, whoo!",S01E02,90
What are you looking at? I was here first.,S01E02,91
"Hey, you can ride that duck.",S01E02,92
I couldn't ride the duck.,S01E02,93
I'd look silly on the duck.,S01E02,94
Fine.,S01E02,95
"Hey there, Charlie. Are we having fun yet?",S01E02,96
All right.,S01E02,97
"Man, you seen a kid's birthday party around here anywhere?",S01E02,98
I'm the entertainment.,S01E02,99
I saw a bounce house of the other end of the park.,S01E02,100
"A bouncy house, eh? Great.",S01E02,101
Another trip to the E.,S01E02,102
R.,S01E02,103
Who are you supposed to be anyway?,S01E02,104
"Plastic man, rubber man?",S01E02,105
"No, those are all registered trademarks.",S01E02,106
I'm Captain Stretchy.,S01E02,107
"There used to be a CS here, but it came off in the wash.",S01E02,108
So what's your super power?,S01E02,109
Super elasticity.,S01E02,110
"Hey, look, there's a quarter.",S01E02,111
"Ah, forget it.",S01E02,112
"Not like it's a dollar, right?",S01E02,113
- Hi.,S01E02,114
- Hi.,S01E02,115
"Oh, yeah, I like your taste in strollers.",S01E02,116
"Thanks, you too.",S01E02,117
- That baby's so cute.,S01E02,118
- You too.,S01E02,119
"Oh, I mean yours too.",S01E02,120
- I'm Emma. - I'm PJ,S01E02,121
- Who's this little guy? - My brother.,S01E02,122
We're just out for our stroll.,S01E02,123
We do this every day.,S01E02,124
Us too.,S01E02,125
"Like I always say, babies love parks.",S01E02,126
- Would you like to sit for a bit? - Sure.,S01E02,127
So I saw you talking to Captain Stretchy earlier.,S01E02,128
"Oh, yeah, he was lost.",S01E02,129
"- Not much of a superhero, right? - Oh, he's the worst.",S01E02,130
We hired him for my brother's birthday party,S01E02,131
- and he sat on the cake.,S01E02,132
- That sounds awful.,S01E02,133
"Oh, it gets worse.",S01E02,134
"The candles was lit, so he sat in the punch",S01E02,135
That's so weird.,S01E02,136
I mean he looks like such a quality entertainer.,S01E02,137
"You know, PJ, I'm really impressed that",S01E02,138
you take your baby sister to the park.,S01E02,139
My brothers would never do anything like that.,S01E02,140
I hope not.,S01E02,141
She is my sister.,S01E02,142
Now watch closely. In this hand I have a quarter,S01E02,143
"And in the other, an ordinary egg.",S01E02,144
"Now I put them in this hat, spin them around a little",S01E02,145
And presto.,S01E02,146
"Just out of curiosity,",S01E02,147
What was supposed to happen?,S01E02,148
I love this baby.,S01E02,149
"Anytime she wants to go to the park, sign me up.",S01E02,150
What happened to you?,S01E02,151
"Let's just say charlie made a friend, PJmade a friend.",S01E02,152
Oh-- and did either you or your friend bother to change a diper?,S01E02,153
There's no time for that.,S01E02,154
I was too busy talking to Emma.,S01E02,155
"- Who's emma? - A vision,",S01E02,156
"An angel, the girl who's moved into my heart.",S01E02,157
Did you tell her about the vacancy in your brain?,S01E02,158
- PJ? - what?,S01E02,159
You brought home the wrong baby.,S01E02,160
What? I did not.,S01E02,161
Take a look! Wrong parts.,S01E02,162
There's nothing wrong with those parts.,S01E02,163
How could you bring home the wrong baby?,S01E02,164
I'm sorry.,S01E02,165
I got a little distracted.,S01E02,166
Emma is really cute.,S01E02,167
"Yeah, well, so was our sister.",S01E02,168
"Come on, let's go to the park and find her.",S01E02,169
Relax! I got her number.,S01E02,170
Then what are you waiting for? call her.,S01E02,171
Wait a second.,S01E02,172
Is it too soon?,S01E02,173
"If I call now, she'll think I'm desperate.",S01E02,174
"Oh, you are desperate.",S01E02,175
Good point.,S01E02,176
"Hello, is Emma there?",S01E02,177
This is a Chinese restaurant?,S01E02,178
"Sure, I'll hear the specials.",S01E02,179
She gave you the wrong number.,S01E02,180
Who couldn't see that one coming?,S01E02,181
But I gave her gum and helped her change a poopy diaper.,S01E02,182
It was so romantic.,S01E02,183
"Well, what do we do now?",S01E02,184
Oh no!,S01E02,185
"Hi mom, what up?",S01E02,186
"Yeah, everything's going great. why wouldn't it be?",S01E02,187
We're just having a grand old time here with--,S01E02,188
Baby,S01E02,189
"Yeah, sure you can talk to him. her her!",S01E02,190
Talk to mommy.,S01E02,191
What do you mean that did't sound like Charlie?,S01E02,192
"What, do you just think I'm making baby noises into the phone?",S01E02,193
"Mom, that's crazy.",S01E02,194
"All right, bye.",S01E02,195
"Say bye, Charlie.",S01E02,196
"Not that I'm in the position to criticize,",S01E02,197
But I was getting more monkey.,S01E02,198
"Come on, let's go to the park.",S01E02,199
And meet the girl who blew off PJ?,S01E02,200
I'm there.,S01E02,201
"- I don't see her. - PJ, what did she look like?",S01E02,202
"She was hot, but what does it matter?",S01E02,203
Maybe we should call someone.,S01E02,204
who do you call when you search a baby.,S01E02,205
Captain Stretchy!,S01E02,206
What is that?,S01E02,207
You're still here?,S01E02,208
Every saturday and sunday all day long.,S01E02,209
"Stay in school, kids.",S01E02,210
Just the guy we needed to see.,S01E02,211
I think you can help us.,S01E02,212
"Hey, kid, I'm just an entertainer.",S01E02,213
I can't get mommy and daddy back together.,S01E02,214
"No, you don't understand.",S01E02,215
"I was talking to a girl here earlier,",S01E02,216
And she said that you worked a party for her brother.,S01E02,217
So? I work lots of parties.,S01E02,218
Where was the party where you fell on cake?,S01E02,219
You got three hours?,S01E02,220
This is really important.,S01E02,221
We need to find her.,S01E02,222
"Interesting situation. You kids need info,",S01E02,223
- And I need a mirdle. - What is a mirdle?,S01E02,224
That's a man girdle.,S01E02,225
And they ain't cheap.,S01E02,226
"Yeah, neither is dry cleaning, apparently.",S01E02,227
Her name's Emma. Did she come back to the park?,S01E02,228
"Well, maybe she did",S01E02,229
And maybe she didn't.,S01E02,230
Stop rubbing your fingers together and answer my question.,S01E02,231
He wants a bribe.,S01E02,232
I can't believe it.,S01E02,233
Here.,S01E02,234
Here is what I konw: Her name is Emma.,S01E02,235
I just told you that.,S01E02,236
I didn't say the information was fresh.,S01E02,237
"Yeah, I know the girl.",S01E02,238
"She comes from a big family-- seven, eight kids.",S01E02,239
For them I've been,S01E02,240
"Astronaut Pete, cowboy Bob",S01E02,241
- Magic Marv? - Yeah! You're familiar with my work.,S01E02,242
"Yeah, and it stinks.",S01E02,243
I'm just starting off,S01E02,244
- And I'm a better magician than you are. - Oh yeah?,S01E02,245
"You think this is easy, huh? here.",S01E02,246
Turn that into a schnauzer.,S01E02,247
"You can't do it, huh?",S01E02,248
Maybe it's because you don't have the chops!,S01E02,249
"Well, Stretchy, do you know where she lives?",S01E02,250
"Yeah, around here somewhere.",S01E02,251
- I'd know it if I saw it. - Great!,S01E02,252
Now you help us tonight and we'll,S01E02,253
get you into that mirdle tomorrow.,S01E02,254
"Oh, and you understand we're not actually",S01E02,255
Gonna put you into it? That you have to do by yourself.,S01E02,256
"Yeah, I get it.",S01E02,257
"All right, come on, guys, we have to go find her.",S01E02,258
"Uh, hey-- Captain Stretchy, away!",S01E02,259
- Truck's this way.,S01E02,260
"- Oh, okay.",S01E02,261
"Order whatever you want, honey.",S01E02,262
I get a discount here.,S01E02,263
This place is one of my best customers.,S01E02,264
Not what you want to hear from an exterminator.,S01E02,265
"Oh, look at that.",S01E02,266
"Oh, fajitas.",S01E02,267
"Not that, the baby.",S01E02,268
A little baby in a stroller just like ours.,S01E02,269
"Yeah, okay, honey,",S01E02,270
This is supposed to be a night away from the baby.,S01E02,271
So let's come back.,S01E02,272
"Okay okay, I'm back.",S01E02,273
I'm back.,S01E02,274
Just gotta run to the ladies' room.,S01E02,275
"Oh oh, hey, listen, while you're in there,",S01E02,276
Could you check the traps?,S01E02,277
Hola.,S01E02,278
Adios.,S01E02,279
"Bob, will you go over and look at that baby?",S01E02,280
- I think it's Charlie. - What?!,S01E02,281
"You heard me, that is Charlie!",S01E02,282
"Sweetheart, would you sit down, please?",S01E02,283
I will not sit down.,S01E02,284
A mother knows her own baby and that is my baby.,S01E02,285
"Honey, seriously, what do you think happened here?",S01E02,286
"In the last hour somebody went over to our house,",S01E02,287
Borrowed our baby then brought her out for chips and guac?,S01E02,288
"I don't know, it's a big family.",S01E02,289
"- Maybe that's how they get their babies. - Sweetheart,",S01E02,290
I think you're just missing Charlie,S01E02,291
And you're having a little separation anxiety.,S01E02,292
"Oh, okay.",S01E02,293
You're right.,S01E02,294
Crazy wazy.,S01E02,295
"- I mean, that isn't possible, right? - Exactly.",S01E02,296
I'm just going to go to the ladies' room one more time.,S01E02,297
Sit down.,S01E02,298
Now let's enjoy the rest of our night out,S01E02,299
At this very lovely restaurant.,S01E02,300
- Okay? - Okay.,S01E02,301
I'm needed in the kitchen.,S01E02,302
- Charlie! - Emma!,S01E02,303
- Charlie! - Emma!,S01E02,304
- Marco! - Polo.,S01E02,305
"Gabe, not helping.",S01E02,306
"Stretchy, is any of this looking familiar?",S01E02,307
"Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.",S01E02,308
You are not getting any more money.,S01E02,309
"No, I have night blindness.",S01E02,310
All I'm seeing is shapes.,S01E02,311
Why didn't you mention that earlier?,S01E02,312
I needed a ride home.,S01E02,313
Stop here.,S01E02,314
"Oh, great.",S01E02,315
Mom's up.,S01E02,316
Maybe I'll just hang with you kids.,S01E02,317
"Captain Stretchy, away.",S01E02,318
"- Good night, Stretchy.",S01E02,319
"- Good night, Stretchy.",S01E02,320
Good night.,S01E02,321
Now what?,S01E02,322
We didn't hit the streets on the north end of the park.,S01E02,323
"PJ, we can't keep driving around all night.",S01E02,324
It's over.,S01E02,325
We have to tell mom and dad.,S01E02,326
"- But-- - No, it'll be okay.",S01E02,327
They know what to do.,S01E02,328
They always do.,S01E02,329
How am I gonna tell them I lost our baby sister?,S01E02,330
I'm the oldest.,S01E02,331
They're gonna think I'm the most responsible.,S01E02,332
"PJ, if it makes you feel any better,",S01E02,333
Nobody thinks that.,S01E02,334
Why do I always mess everything up?,S01E02,335
You know what? This could have happened to any of us.,S01E02,336
"All right, probably most likely you, but--",S01E02,337
"This one, we're all in it together.",S01E02,338
Thanks.,S01E02,339
"Hey, look,",S01E02,340
Captain Stretchy dropped his driver's license.,S01E02,341
"175 lbs, my butt!",S01E02,342
There they are.,S01E02,343
"All right, let's get this over with.",S01E02,344
Do you think it would be better or worse,S01E02,345
if we had the mariachi deliver the news.,S01E02,346
"If it's in spanish, probably better.",S01E02,347
"Wait, I don't believe it.",S01E02,348
- That's Emma.,S01E02,349
- So that's Charlie.,S01E02,350
"Yes! Oh, we're saved.",S01E02,351
- Not quite.,S01E02,352
"- Hey, kids.",S01E02,353
- What now? - I'll let you know when I think of it.,S01E02,354
"Mom, dad, hi.",S01E02,355
- Hi. - What are you doing here?,S01E02,356
"We just realized you must be missing Charlie,",S01E02,357
So we brought her.,S01E02,358
"Oh, Teddy, you're not fooling me.",S01E02,359
- I'm not? - Nope.,S01E02,360
You spent a little too much time with Charlie,S01E02,361
And you're ready to hand her over early.,S01E02,362
"Well, I wouldn't say too much time.",S01E02,363
"Well, I am ready too, so let me at her.",S01E02,364
- Gimme Gimme Gimme.,S01E02,365
"- Mom, Mom, Mom.",S01E02,366
You're on a date.,S01E02,367
Let me bring her to you.,S01E02,368
"Here? Wait, now?",S01E02,369
"Well, all right.",S01E02,370
"- Hey, mom.",S01E02,371
"- Hi, baby.",S01E02,372
- Hey.,S01E02,373
"- Hey, dad.",S01E02,374
"- Something I want to show you. - What is it, honey?",S01E02,375
"And now for my next trick,",S01E02,376
I'm gonna make a boy disappear.,S01E02,377
"You know, you should be ashamed of yourself.",S01E02,378
"You lead a guy on, make him think you have a connection,",S01E02,379
And you give him a fake phone number.,S01E02,380
You put it in wrong.,S01E02,381
that three is supposed to be a two.,S01E02,382
"Oh, my bad.",S01E02,383
So,S01E02,384
You wanna get a table?,S01E02,385
"My widdle baby, did you miss your mommy and daddy?",S01E02,386
"Yes, she did.",S01E02,387
"yes, she did.",S01E02,388
"Oh, I never thought I'd be so happy to hear baby talk.",S01E02,389
"Teddy, this isn't Charlie's binky. where did you get this?",S01E02,390
"Oh, well, that's actually a really funny story.",S01E02,391
"See, what happened was",S01E02,392
Too loud.,S01E02,393
Tell you later.,S01E02,394
"Well, Charlie, now you're home safe and sound",S01E02,395
And everything turned out okay.,S01E02,396
For you.,S01E02,397
"It would have been okay for us too, but when we got home,",S01E02,398
Mom started asking all these questions,S01E02,399
And no one really had an answer to,S01E02,400
the pee stains in the living room.,S01E02,401
And that's when the truth came out,S01E02,402
and all the kids got into trouble.,S01E02,403
So the lesson is if you ever try,S01E02,404
"to pull anything over on Mom,",S01E02,405
"Good luck, Charlie.",S01E02,406
Couldn't have said it better myself.,S01E02,407
In this hand I have a quarter.,S01E02,408
"And in the other hand, an ordinary egg.",S01E02,409
"Now I put them in this hat,",S01E02,410
Spin them around and,S01E02,411
Presto! Now hold out your hand.,S01E02,412
"Wow, that's a great trick.",S01E02,413
How'd you do that?,S01E02,414
Interesting situation.,S01E02,415
"It seems you need information,",S01E02,416
Meanwhile I need a new video game.,S01E02,417
What a chump.,S01E02,418
"Who you calling a chump? Hey, get back here.",S01E02,419
"Hi, Charlie.",S01E03,0
it's your big sister Teddy with my video diary.,S01E03,1
"So today, I want to talk to you about best friends.",S01E03,2
You bragging about me again?,S01E03,3
Huh.,S01E03,4
"yeah, this is Ivy.",S01E03,5
she's my BFF.,S01E03,6
"I'm also her hero,",S01E03,7
"The wind beneath her wings, the hip in her hop,",S01E03,8
The peanut to her butter.,S01E03,9
- I am-- - the mouth that wouldn't shut.,S01E03,10
Let's see how we're looking.,S01E03,11
Perfect!,S01E03,12

So what's the big news?,S01E03,15
you are not gonna believe what I did for you,S01E03,16
I saw the cutest guy working at the mall food court,S01E03,17
And pause for dramatic effect,S01E03,18
Tomorrow I'm going to talk to him.,S01E03,19
How is this something you're doing for me?,S01E03,20
Maybe he has a friend.,S01E03,21
the cute ones always have a friend.,S01E03,22
"I mean, I have you, right?",S01E03,23
"Hi, girls. What you doing?",S01E03,24
Nothin'.,S01E03,25
"- How's it going, Ivy? - Real good.",S01E03,26
Ignore her.,S01E03,27
she'll go away.,S01E03,28
You girls are always on those phones.,S01E03,29
- Who are you texting now? - Nobody.,S01E03,30
I wish I could do that.,S01E03,31
"Hey, then you and I could text each other. Wouldn't that be fun?",S01E03,32
"Oh my gosh, mom, I'd love that!",S01E03,33
Eww!,S01E03,34
- I don't think I can text from this phone.,S01E03,35
"- oh, well.",S01E03,36
"Sure you can, Miss D. what's your number?",S01E03,37
555-0134.,S01E03,38
Not ignoring.,S01E03,39
What is that noise?,S01E03,40

Just hit that button to read it.,S01E03,42
"Well, look at that.",S01E03,43
"Oh, that's funny, Ivy.",S01E03,44
Then your response is lol.,S01E03,45
laugh out loud.,S01E03,46
"No-- no, mom.",S01E03,47
"you don't do it, you type it.",S01E03,48
"Or if you want to get a little saucy,",S01E03,49
You can wink.,S01E03,50
Not there.,S01E03,51
There.,S01E03,52
Just a semicolon and parentheses.,S01E03,53
"Oh, that does look like a wink.",S01E03,54
I can't believe I'm finally a texter.,S01E03,55
Let's see if it works from the kitchen!,S01E03,56
- WHYD? - What have you done?,S01E03,57
Today's all burnt toast{\i0},S01E03,58

Don't ignore me!,S01E03,77
"When I tell you to do something, I expect you to do it!",S01E03,78
"Get off my back, woman!",S01E03,79
You want me off your back? I can arrange that.,S01E03,80
"Charlie, those are our neighbors, the Dabneys.",S01E03,81
They've been married a long time.,S01E03,82
"Hey, PJ, I just kicked the football into the Dabneys' backyard.",S01E03,83
Will you go get it?,S01E03,84
No way! they're going at it again.,S01E03,85
"- Well, what about the football? - Who cares?",S01E03,86
It's gone.,S01E03,87
Kiss it goodbye.,S01E03,88
"Well, I'm glad to hear you say that",S01E03,89
Because it was your football.,S01E03,90
Ha! I warned you!,S01E03,91
That's what you get for being a bad husband!,S01E03,92
And now you're dead!,S01E03,93
Is somebody out here?,S01E03,94
Who's out here?,S01E03,95

It was chilling.,S01E03,100
"Just so I'm clear, you didn't get the football?",S01E03,101
"- I'm serious, Gabe.",S01E03,102
- Come on.,S01E03,103
"Mrs Dabney may be a mean, vicious, cruel,",S01E03,104
"horrible, nasty old witch,",S01E03,105
But she'd never do something like that.,S01E03,106
- You don't believe me? - No.,S01E03,107
Fine.,S01E03,108
"fine, I'll prove it.",S01E03,109
"Come here, Gabe.",S01E03,110
Hello?,S01E03,111
Is Mr Dabney home?,S01E03,112
He can't come to the phone.,S01E03,113
Interesting.,S01E03,114
Who is this?,S01E03,115
Uh-- I'm some sort of salesman.,S01E03,116
"Gabe, is that you?",S01E03,117
Why would you assume my name is gabe?,S01E03,118
Because I have caller ID.,S01E03,119
Oh.,S01E03,120
"then yeah, it's Gabe.",S01E03,121
Hey!,S01E03,122

"- PJ, she's not a murderer.",S01E03,124
"- I heard what I heard, gabe.",S01E03,125
Why don't you believe me?,S01E03,126
Because you're you and you get things wrong.,S01E03,127
"What are you saying, that I'm dumb?",S01E03,128
"Well, no.",S01E03,129
You're just not very,S01E03,130
- thinky. - thinky?,S01E03,131
"Gabe, why would you say something like that?",S01E03,132
'cause mom said I can't call you dumb.,S01E03,133
It is so pathetic.,S01E03,134
My mom's in the kitchen texting away.,S01E03,135
"Gosh, I'd hate to be on the other end of that conversation.",S01E03,136
Who are you texting?,S01E03,137

I'm sorry. is this a problem for you?,S01E03,152
"No, I just think it's a little bit inappropriate.",S01E03,153
Inappropriate? Now you sound like my mother.,S01E03,154
"Well, how would you know what your mother sounds like?",S01E03,155
You've been spending so much time with mine!,S01E03,156
What are you getting so whacked about?,S01E03,157
You didn't want to text her.,S01E03,158
"Well yeah, that's because she's my mom, not my friend.",S01E03,159
Wouldn't you be weirded out if I was texting your mom?,S01E03,160
Yes.,S01E03,161
Because she doesn't have a cell phone.,S01E03,162
"Look, T, if you're not cool with this,",S01E03,163

"PJ, you've got to stop watching these mysteries.",S01E03,173
Not until i figure out how to catch Mrs Dabney.,S01E03,174
These old movies are gonna help me do that.,S01E03,175
That's like saying cartoons will teach you how to run through walls.,S01E03,176
Learned that the hard way.,S01E03,177
Mom! Can you get that?!,S01E03,178
"Sure, I'll get the door.",S01E03,179

Maybe you can help me with a problem I'm having.,S01E03,202
How do I get the smell of death out of my house?,S01E03,203
Will you turn that TV down?,S01E03,204
So you think something died in your house?,S01E03,205
"Oh, I know something is dead",S01E03,206
"Well, first thing you're gonna have to do",S01E03,207
is locate and dispose of the carcass.,S01E03,208

A long while.,S01E03,211

- Where?.,S01E03,323
"By the couch, right-- right there.",S01E03,324
- It's a baby! - It's Charlie!,S01E03,325
"No, it's not. charlie's right over--",S01E03,326
inside the murder house!,S01E03,327
"Okay, try to stay with me now",S01E03,328
Because we're going to get a little wild.,S01E03,329
"Instead of knit one, purl two,",S01E03,330
"We kick it up to knit one, purl three!",S01E03,331
Is that even legal?,S01E03,332
"I don't know,",S01E03,333
But I just like living dangerously!,S01E03,334
"Okay, I'm gonna go get something to drink.",S01E03,335
"- Do you want anything? - Oh, not now.",S01E03,336
I'm in the zone!,S01E03,337
What you doing in here?,S01E03,338
Giving up.,S01E03,339
Did she suck the life out of you?,S01E03,340
"Yeah, pretty much.",S01E03,341
Now you see why I'm always at your house.,S01E03,342
"Yeah, I'm so sorry.",S01E03,343
I was being selfish with my mom.,S01E03,344
"And even though I think it's a little bit weird,",S01E03,345
You can text her as much as you want.,S01E03,346
I think I got a better idea.,S01E03,347
"And then, get this,",S01E03,348
"If you type in a semicolon parentheses,",S01E03,349
- You get a-- - Winky face!,S01E03,350
I have got to get a cell phone.,S01E03,351
I like it. You put our moms together,S01E03,352
And they leave us alone.,S01E03,353
You are brilliant.,S01E03,354
"See, this is why we're BFFs.",S01E03,355
I'm brilliant and you recognize it.,S01E03,356
Now if I type ROTF.,S01E03,357
Do I actually have to roll on the floor?,S01E03,358
"I thought the same thing at first,",S01E03,359
But no.,S01E03,360
This'll get her out.,S01E03,361
Charlie loves things that rattle.,S01E03,362
"Okay, girl.",S01E03,363
"Charlie, come on.",S01E03,364
Get the keys. Get the keys!,S01E03,365
"Aw, man! I dropped the keys.",S01E03,366
Fantastic!,S01E03,367
Now we can't get into our house either.,S01E03,368
- I don't see charlie.,S01E03,369
"Where'd she go? - Oh, there she is.",S01E03,370
"Wait, what is she putting on her head,",S01E03,371
A dishtowel?,S01E03,372
Mrs Dabney's underpants!,S01E03,373
Oh!,S01E03,374
- Man! - Oh-ho!,S01E03,375
"Come on, we gotta get her out of there.",S01E03,376
"Yeah, come on.",S01E03,377
What are you doing in my yard?,S01E03,378
We're here to help you with your groceries.,S01E03,379
You want to be helpful?,S01E03,380
I like to try new things.,S01E03,381
"Here, let me give you a hand with that.",S01E03,382
I can handle the groceries.,S01E03,383
"But as long as you're here,",S01E03,384
I could use your help with something inside.,S01E03,385
Inside? Perfect.,S01E03,386
Let me just put my groceries down.,S01E03,387
- Take your time.,S01E03,388
- Yeah.,S01E03,389
Yeah.,S01E03,390
- Where's Charlie? - uh--,S01E03,391
- Look behind the curtains! - Okay.,S01E03,392
- Nothing! - There she is!,S01E03,393
"Oh, I've got you.",S01E03,394
Yeah.,S01E03,395
I don't want it!,S01E03,396
Stop it!,S01E03,397
Where did that baby come from?,S01E03,398
Charlie? I've been holding her the whole time.,S01E03,399
"- You have? - That's sad, Mrs Dabney.",S01E03,400
They say the eyes are the first things to go.,S01E03,401
We gotta go.,S01E03,402
Not so fast.,S01E03,403
Put the baby down.,S01E03,404
I need you to carry something out for me.,S01E03,405
I want you to take this trunk out to my car.,S01E03,406
It's too heavy for me.,S01E03,407
Why? What's in it?,S01E03,408
Something I should've gotten rid of a long time ago.,S01E03,409
- Where are you taking it? - To the dump.,S01E03,410
"That's where you take trash, isn't it?",S01E03,411
Trash?!,S01E03,412
"Mr Dabney wasn't trash, he was a person!",S01E03,413
What are you talking about?,S01E03,414
You know exactly what I am talking about.,S01E03,415
You bumped off your husband and stuffed him into that trunk.,S01E03,416
- Is that what you think?! - That's what we know!,S01E03,417
"What is she-- oh, watch it!",S01E03,418
She's kill-crazy!,S01E03,419
You want to see what's in here?,S01E03,420
Take a look.,S01E03,421
Whoa! It's Mr Dabney!,S01E03,422
And he's already decomposed!,S01E03,423
That's not Mr Dabney.,S01E03,424
That's a skeleton he used in his classroom.,S01E03,425
He used to be a science teacher.,S01E03,426
But I heard you screaming at him.,S01E03,427
"You called him a bad husband and then you said,",S01E03,428
and now you're dead!,S01E03,429
Oh! you must have heard me talking back to someone on my soaps.,S01E03,430
Soaps?,S01E03,431
Soap operas on TV,S01E03,432
Like the one they should name after you two--,S01E03,433
the young and the clueless.,S01E03,434
"Well, if Mr Dabney isn't dead, then where is he?",S01E03,435
At his mother's probably wishing he was dead.,S01E03,436
"Well, then how do you explain the smell of death you asked my dad about?",S01E03,437
Dead possum in my dryer vent.,S01E03,438
"Well, then how do you explain--",S01E03,439
"That's pretty much it, I guess.",S01E03,440
Just one more question--,S01E03,441
Do you have any cookies?,S01E03,442
Get out.,S01E03,443
What are my underpants doing in the fireplace?,S01E03,444
Gotta go!,S01E03,445
Dat-da-da-da! Here she comes!,S01E03,446
Coolest mom in the world! Yay.,S01E03,447
"Okay, what's all this?",S01E03,448
"Oh, just showing Charlie how much I love you.",S01E03,449
"Oh, I love you too, sweetie.",S01E03,450
"And I love you too, Charlie.",S01E03,451
"Oh, so mom, I've been thinking--",S01E03,452
Maybe you and I should start texting.,S01E03,453
"I mean, you are a pretty cool mom, right?",S01E03,454
"Oh, sorry, honey.",S01E03,455
Those days are over.,S01E03,456
Text thumbs.,S01E03,457
Text thumbs? That's our mom--,S01E03,458
From cool to embarrassing just like that.,S01E03,459
All right.,S01E03,460
"good luck, Charlie.",S01E03,461
"Hey, guys.",S01E03,462
Better make your friend a sandwich.,S01E03,463
He's looking a little thin.,S01E03,464
Where'd you guys get that thing?,S01E03,465
Mrs Dabney was throwing it out.,S01E03,466
"Yeah, it belonged to Mr Dabney.",S01E03,467
He was a science teacher.,S01E03,468
Mr dabney wasn't a science teacher.,S01E03,469
He was a music teacher.,S01E03,470
What?!,S01E03,471
- That means-- - This is--,S01E03,472
Mr Dabney wasn't a music teacher.,S01E03,473
You're thinking of-- of Mr Dixon across the street.,S01E03,474
"Oh, that's right.",S01E03,475
Mr Dabney was a science teacher.,S01E03,476
The boys seem a little jumpy to you?,S01E03,477
"Ah, I just got here.",S01E03,478
"Hi, Charlie.",S01E04,0
Teddy here.,S01E04,1
And Ivy.,S01E04,2
So you're 11 months old now,S01E04,3
and something really big is about to happen to you.,S01E04,4
You're about to take your very first steps.,S01E04,5
This is your biggest milestone,S01E04,6
since your first solid poop.,S01E04,7
"Okay, relax.",S01E04,8
I didn't get it on video.,S01E04,9
"Okay, you're my best friend again.",S01E04,10
"Anyways, I wanted to capture your first steps on tape",S01E04,11
"but every time I put the camera on you,",S01E04,12
all I see is this.,S01E04,13
Wait.,S01E04,14
Wait.,S01E04,15
Wait.,S01E04,16
And nothing.,S01E04,17
Same thing happened with the poop.,S01E04,18
Today's all burnt toast{\i0},S01E04,19
"Running late,and dad jokes{\i0}",S01E04,20
Has anybody seen my left shoe{\i0},S01E04,21
"I close my eyes, take a bite{\i0}",S01E04,22
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud{\i0}",S01E04,23
There it is up on the roof{\i0},S01E04,24
"I've been there, I've survived{\i0}",S01E04,25
So just take my advice{\i0},S01E04,26
"Hang in there, baby, things are crazy{\i0}",S01E04,27
But I know your future is bright{\i0},S01E04,28
"Hang in there, Baby{\i0}",S01E04,29
There is no maybe{\i0},S01E04,30
Eveything turns out all right{\i0},S01E04,31
Sure life is up and down{\i0},S01E04,32
"But trust me, it comes back all around{\i0}",S01E04,33
You're gonna love who you turn out to be{\i0},S01E04,34
"Hang in there, Baby{\i0}",S01E04,35
"Girls, girls, come here.",S01E04,36
Check it out.,S01E04,37
It's an old video of me.,S01E04,38
Lots of videotaping in this family.,S01E04,39
You guys sure do like yourselves.,S01E04,40
It's from my old glory days back at south high.,S01E04,41
"No way, Mrs.",S01E04,42
D.,S01E04,43
You went to our school?.,S01E04,44
"No, you're going to my school.",S01E04,45
"Whoa whoa, there I am--",S01E04,46
The school mascot.,S01E04,47
You were that big sheep thing?,S01E04,48
Not a sheep.,S01E04,49
A ram.,S01E04,50
Rammy the Wammy.,S01E04,51
Here it is--,S01E04,52
My famous wammy wiggle.,S01E04,53
Listen to the crowd.,S01E04,54
They love me.,S01E04,55
"Well, sure.",S01E04,56
Everybody loves a dancing sheep.,S01E04,57
"Again,",S01E04,58
It's a ram.,S01E04,59
It has horns.,S01E04,60
"It sure looks like a lot of fun, Mom.",S01E04,61
You really think so?,S01E04,62
Yeah yeah.,S01E04,63
Do you think I'd say something like that,S01E04,64
Just to humor you?,S01E04,65
I'm so happy to hear that,S01E04,66
Because they're holding mascot tryouts this week.,S01E04,67
"But, mom, you've already been wammy.",S01E04,68
Why would you try out again?,S01E04,69
I'm talking about you.,S01E04,70
Please tell me You Is Ivy.,S01E04,71
"Think about it, Teddy.",S01E04,72
You would be the first ever second-generation wammy.,S01E04,73
I've been dreaming about this since you were born.,S01E04,74
"According to the internet, sheep can have horns.",S01E04,75
"Look, I don't want to put any pressure on you.",S01E04,76
It's your decision.,S01E04,77
You do not have to do this for me.,S01E04,78
- I don't?  - No.,S01E04,79
You'll do it for us.,S01E04,80
- Hey. - What are you doing?,S01E04,81
Watching all my old wammy videos with Teddy.,S01E04,82
Teddy?,S01E04,83
You're missing all the good parts.,S01E04,84
What am I saying? They're all good parts.,S01E04,85
Except for this one.,S01E04,86
"Remember this, Bob?",S01E04,87
"Oh, how can I forget?",S01E04,88
The night the north high barbarian took you down.,S01E04,89
Oh!,S01E04,90
I hated that guy.,S01E04,91
"Even for a barbarian, he was a jerk.",S01E04,92
You remember the time those goons from north high,S01E04,93
"grabbed you, took you on a little joyride?",S01E04,94
Every wammy's worst nightmare.,S01E04,95
You know what? I can't even watch it.,S01E04,96
It's too painful even now.,S01E04,97
"Oh, wait, this is a good part.",S01E04,98
"Come here, kids.",S01E04,99
You're gonna love this.,S01E04,100
Recognize that guy?,S01E04,101
Is that PJ?,S01E04,102
"Nope, that's me.",S01E04,103
You mean that thin guy with a full head of hair is you?,S01E04,104
Yep.,S01E04,105
So that means,S01E04,106
I'm gonna look like you when I get old.,S01E04,107
"Oh, I stopped looking like that when I was 25.",S01E04,108
But that's only eight years from now.,S01E04,109
Enjoy it while you got it.,S01E04,110
"If I were you, I'd marry young.",S01E04,111
What are you doing in here?,S01E04,112
Not being out there. What tape is she up to?,S01E04,113
"Volume three, Wammy behind the mask.",S01E04,114
"Dad, she wants me to try out.",S01E04,115
"Oh, boy.",S01E04,116
I knew this day was coming.,S01E04,117
But I don't want to be a mascot.,S01E04,118
I'll be the biggest dork in school.,S01E04,119
You gotta help me out here.,S01E04,120
- What do you want me to do? - Can't you talk to her?,S01E04,121
"Yeah, okay.",S01E04,122
"I'll do that, honey, right after I mention",S01E04,123
that her favorite pants make her look fat.,S01E04,124
- Who looks fat? - My mother.,S01E04,125
"Hey, we almost ended at the same time.",S01E04,126
Only because I dropped one of my sticks.,S01E04,127
Did you see Charlie?,S01E04,128
She was totally rocking out.,S01E04,129
- Is she amazing or what? - She's okay.,S01E04,130
Okay? What is that supposed to mean?,S01E04,131
You guys are always going on and on,S01E04,132
about what a super baby charlie is.,S01E04,133
"Man, I got a nephew mason.",S01E04,134
Now that's a baby.,S01E04,135
What's so great about Mason?,S01E04,136
"Well, for one thing he's a stud at peek-a-boo.",S01E04,137
"Come on, Charlie can play peek-a-boo with her eyes closed.",S01E04,138
That's how you play peek-a-boo.,S01E04,139
What else you got?,S01E04,140
"Well, Mason's an incredibly fast crawler.",S01E04,141
Not as fast as Charlie.,S01E04,142
She's like a cat.,S01E04,143
Mason sleeps at night with a rabbit--,S01E04,144
"Not a stuffed one, one that he caught.",S01E04,145
So you think mason's faster.,S01E04,146
I think charlie's faster.,S01E04,147
There's only one way to settle this.,S01E04,148
We challenge you to a baby race.,S01E04,149
"Oh, it is on.",S01E04,150
And you're gonna be sorry,S01E04,151
Because mason rhymes with racin'.,S01E04,152
We'll take our chances.,S01E04,153
"In the meantime, you might want to take a good look at this,",S01E04,154
Because that's all you and mason are gonna be seeing.,S01E04,155
I can't believe you're trying out for wammy.,S01E04,156
The whole idea behind this friendship,S01E04,157
"was for you to make me more popular,",S01E04,158
Not less popular.,S01E04,159
"Okay, relax.",S01E04,160
I said I had to try out.,S01E04,161
I didn't say I had to do well.,S01E04,162
"All right, people.",S01E04,163
Time for wammy tryouts.,S01E04,164
"- First up, Teddy Duncan.",S01E04,165
- I'm Teddy.,S01E04,166
"Daughter of Amy Duncan,",S01E04,167
The second finest wammy this school has ever seen.,S01E04,168
- Who was the first? - You're looking at her.,S01E04,169
Let's do this thing!,S01E04,170
"All right, duncan, let me set the scene for you.",S01E04,171
The team is down by eight.,S01E04,172
You need to get that crowd jazzed up.,S01E04,173
Now give me what you got!,S01E04,174
"Come on, crowd, jazz up.",S01E04,175
I am not feeling that.,S01E04,176
Moving on. How's your dancing?,S01E04,177
You tell me.,S01E04,178
What was that?,S01E04,179
That was interpretive dancing.,S01E04,180
That piece was called Spring Day.,S01E04,181
I can also show you Global Warming,S01E04,182
Or Dogs Wow!,S01E04,183
Dancing-- question mark.,S01E04,184
Question mark?,S01E04,185
"That stuck, exclamation point!",S01E04,186
"All right, duncan, one more thing.",S01E04,187
Take that flag there and fire up that crowd.,S01E04,188
There's something wrong with that flag.,S01E04,189
"Duncan, that was absolutely terrible, all of it.",S01E04,190
It's okay.,S01E04,191
I know what you're gonna say.,S01E04,192
"Congratulations, wammy.",S01E04,193
But I was awful.,S01E04,194
"Yeah, but you're the only one who tried out.",S01E04,195
See you at the big game.,S01E04,196
I can't believe this.,S01E04,197
"Well, in hindsight,",S01E04,198
I guess we should have noticed,S01E04,199
that nobody else was here.,S01E04,200
"Hey, Gabe, do me a favor.",S01E04,201
Check the back of my head.,S01E04,202
Does it look like I'm going bald?,S01E04,203
"Well, it's tempting to say yes,",S01E04,204
So yes.,S01E04,205
Seriously?,S01E04,206
No.,S01E04,207
Your hair is as full and stupid-looking as ever.,S01E04,208
Thank you.,S01E04,209
You're a good brother.,S01E04,210
Is this why you wanted me to come down here?,S01E04,211
"No, it is time to train Charlie for the baby race.",S01E04,212
Charlie?,S01E04,213
I thought the baby race was gonna be,S01E04,214
You and Emmett in diapers.,S01E04,215
Now I've lost interest.,S01E04,216
"Okay, turbo baby,",S01E04,217
Let's see what you've got.,S01E04,218
Looks like I've got a little work to do.,S01E04,219
There she is.,S01E04,220
"Hi, mom.",S01E04,221
"Hi, Wammy.",S01E04,222
"Oh, did Miss Covington call you?",S01E04,223
"No, it's on the school website.",S01E04,224
"Already? There's not a picture up of me, is there?",S01E04,225
There is now.,S01E04,226
I just sent one in.,S01E04,227
And I've got a big surprise for you.,S01E04,228
I kept it at the end of my last season.,S01E04,229
It's been sitting in the back of the shed for the last 20 years.,S01E04,230
Then I can't wait to put it on my head.,S01E04,231
Come on.,S01E04,232
"Get it on there, girl.",S01E04,233
We've got some work to do.,S01E04,234
"Teddy, you look so beautiful.",S01E04,235
Smells like armpit in here.,S01E04,236
I know.,S01E04,237
You'll get used to it.,S01E04,238
"Okay, I'm gonna teach you some of my signature Wammy moves.",S01E04,239
"You gotta hit it hard, girl.",S01E04,240
Now you gotta keep in rhythm.,S01E04,241
And the best way to do that is with the Wammy wiggle.,S01E04,242
"A-five, six, seven, eight!",S01E04,243
Now we're gonna build on that move. You ready?,S01E04,244
We're gonna get our steam up.,S01E04,245
It goes like this.,S01E04,246
"Whoo, ah-whoo, ah-whoo.",S01E04,247
"No no, sweetheart.",S01E04,248
You lost your wiggle.,S01E04,249
"If you try to get your steam up without the wiggle,",S01E04,250
You'll just look like a fool out there.,S01E04,251
Sure wouldn't want that to happen.,S01E04,252
Next I want you to jump up in the air,S01E04,253
And you gotta land with your arms forming a big W.,S01E04,254
That's really cute.,S01E04,255
"No no no, Teddy.",S01E04,256
It's all in the elbows.,S01E04,257
You're not Vammy.,S01E04,258
You're not Hammy.,S01E04,259
You're Wammy!,S01E04,260
"Okay, girl, you do it.",S01E04,261
Now dig deep and let your fire fly!,S01E04,262
I can't do this.,S01E04,263
Sure you can.,S01E04,264
You just gotta practice.,S01E04,265
Wammy wasn't built in a day.,S01E04,266
"No, I don't want to do this.",S01E04,267
What?,S01E04,268
I don't want to be Hammy or Vammy or Wammy!,S01E04,269
I quit.,S01E04,270
"Hey, what did you do to your mother?",S01E04,271
I told her I didn' want to be a Wammy.,S01E04,272
I was just being honest with her.,S01E04,273
Honest? What are you thinking?,S01E04,274
How's she taking it?,S01E04,275
Not well.,S01E04,276
"She's lying in bed with her Wammy head on,",S01E04,277
Stuffing tissues up her snout.,S01E04,278
I don't know.,S01E04,279
Maybe being Wammy was cool when you guys were in school,S01E04,280
Are you kidding me? It was never cool.,S01E04,281
Your mom just didn't know that.,S01E04,282
How could she not know that?,S01E04,283
Did she spend all four years of high school wearing that giant head?,S01E04,284
It was her yearbook picture.,S01E04,285
"Look, Teddy, if you don't go to that big game",S01E04,286
"There's gonna be no Wammy,",S01E04,287
And that is gonna break your mother's heart.,S01E04,288
"Dad, I just don't want to look stupid.",S01E04,289
"Look, you're gonna let your mom and everybody at school down",S01E04,290
Because you're afraid of looking stupid?,S01E04,291
"Yes, thank you for understanding.",S01E04,292
"Honey, I'm not gonna tell you what to do.",S01E04,293
"But just remember,",S01E04,294
Sometimes the right decision,S01E04,295
Can feel like the wrong decision.,S01E04,296
And the hard decision can be the best decision.,S01E04,297
But the good decision,S01E04,298
"Oh, come on, please just be Wammy!",S01E04,299
"Hey, Wammy. Going somewhere?",S01E04,300
Ever been to north high? cause I was thinking,S01E04,301
We could all take a little trip.,S01E04,302
It's about to charge. Get it!,S01E04,303
"Oh, this is the greatest prank ever!",S01E04,304
"All right, let's see what nerd is wearing the costume this year.",S01E04,305
"Dude, Wammy's old.",S01E04,306
Wammy is not old.,S01E04,307
Wammy had four kids.,S01E04,308
I didn't see her.,S01E04,309
Your mom's not in there.,S01E04,310
I can't believe it.,S01E04,311
She's the only reason I'm doing this stupid thing.,S01E04,312
"Well, let's get out of here.",S01E04,313
"Duncan, the gym's this way.",S01E04,314
Let me look at you.,S01E04,315
Not you Wammy.,S01E04,316
Put on the head.,S01E04,317
"Oh, you look so much like your mother.",S01E04,318
Showtime!,S01E04,319
"I'm right behind you, t.",S01E04,320
Got your back.,S01E04,321
"Gentlemen, start your babies.",S01E04,322
Go!,S01E04,323
And they're off!,S01E04,324
"Oh, look, Mason.",S01E04,325
Yummy yummy.,S01E04,326
Come to the peaches.,S01E04,327
Come to mommy.,S01E04,328
Come to mommy.,S01E04,329
Mason got the early lead.,S01E04,330
Charlie's bringing up the rear.,S01E04,331
Look at my boy go.,S01E04,332
He's barely breaking a sweat.,S01E04,333
"At the halfway mark it's Mason, followed by Charlie.",S01E04,334
"Come on, Charlie.",S01E04,335
You can do it.,S01E04,336
Coming down the home stretch.,S01E04,337
It's still Mason in the lead.,S01E04,338
"Come on, Charlie.",S01E04,339
It's now or never.,S01E04,340
And the winner is,S01E04,341
Charlie!,S01E04,342
"Oh my gosh! Charlie, you just took your first steps.",S01E04,343
"Not your best day, Mason.",S01E04,344
What went wrong out there?,S01E04,345
We'll be back when we learn how to walk.,S01E04,346
Can you please take me back to the gym?,S01E04,347
No way.,S01E04,348
Not till the game's over.,S01E04,349
"Okay, can you take me home then?",S01E04,350
"I don't even care about the game, guys.",S01E04,351
"North High, South High what's the difference?",S01E04,352
Only one thing,S01E04,353
- North High rules! - Yeah!,S01E04,354
"Yeah, baby!",S01E04,355
"Okay, whatever.",S01E04,356
"Look, if we're gonna drive around in circles for hours,",S01E04,357
- Can I at least use the bathroom? - Can't you hold it?,S01E04,358
I've had four kids.,S01E04,359
I pee when I sneeze.,S01E04,360
Gross.,S01E04,361
Pull over.,S01E04,362
Thank you.,S01E04,363
You're such a gentleman.,S01E04,364
South High rules!,S01E04,365
Safety first.,S01E04,366
Ram on the lam!,S01E04,367
Staring at my baldness,S01E04,368
Ain't gonna stop your baldness.,S01E04,369
I just can't believe that's gonna happen to me.,S01E04,370
Would you stop focusing on the negatives?,S01E04,371
- Think about the positives. - Like what?,S01E04,372
You're gonna have a large baseball cap collection.,S01E04,373
You're gonna save on shampoo.,S01E04,374
And with the money you save on shampoo,S01E04,375
You can buy more baseball caps.,S01E04,376
Here comes Teddy.,S01E04,377
That's my best friend.,S01E04,378
Wammy's my best friend.,S01E04,379
Wammy! Wammy! Wammy!,S01E04,380
"Well, Charlie, looks like we both took baby steps today.",S01E04,381
You walked for the first time,S01E04,382
And I did something I didn't want to do and wound up liking it.,S01E04,383
"And I hope you like it too, because",S01E04,384
You are aready on your way.,S01E04,385
Wammy jammy!,S01E04,386
"Good luck, Charlie.",S01E04,387
"Come on, P.",S01E04,388
J.,S01E04,389
We're gonna be late for school.,S01E04,390
Get down here.,S01E04,391
"Alright, coming.",S01E04,392
Chillax.,S01E04,393
"Oh, oh, no.",S01E04,394
"Oh, no.",S01E04,395
It's happening.,S01E04,396
"No,I am not ready.",S01E04,397
No.,S01E04,398
- Bad Dream?  - Yeah.,S01E04,399
"Oh, hey.",S01E04,400
Here's the first one my dad gave me.,S01E04,401
"Hey, Charlie, Teddy here",S01E05,0
On the couch where I almost got my first kiss with Spencer.,S01E05,1
But she didn't.,S01E05,2
"No no, because",S01E05,3
I made the mistake of bringing the cute boy home,S01E05,4
Where my dear family lives.,S01E05,5
He wasn't that cute.,S01E05,6
Get out.,S01E05,7
"Anyway, still waiting on that first kiss.",S01E05,8
But there's a dance this Friday,S01E05,9
"Where the girls ask the guys,",S01E05,10
And this time I'm going to make sure I get it.,S01E05,11
"Get what, honey?",S01E05,12
"Oh, my first A+ in science, daddy.",S01E05,13
That's my girl.,S01E05,14
"Hey, dad, great news.",S01E05,15
I got a job.,S01E05,16
Stop right there.,S01E05,17
I'm having the greatest dream of my life.,S01E05,18
The school's gonna pay me 100 bucks to DJ at the dance on Friday.,S01E05,19
The dream continues.,S01E05,20
I just need you to give me $200 to rent the DJ equipment.,S01E05,21
And now I'm awake.,S01E05,22
"Hey, what was I doing in the dream?",S01E05,23
"You weren't saying anything, which is why I thought it was a dream.",S01E05,24
P.,S01E05,25
J.,S01E05,26
", why would you take a job where you're gonna lose money?.",S01E05,27
Does everything always have to be about money?,S01E05,28
Are you giving me the 200?,S01E05,29
"Sorry, son.",S01E05,30
You're gonna have to come up with the money some other way.,S01E05,31
Like how?,S01E05,32
"Oh, I know.",S01E05,33
Get a job.,S01E05,34
I'll be right back.,S01E05,35
"Wait, where's your sister?",S01E05,36
"Don't bother her, Emmett.",S01E05,37
"Okay, where shouldn't I bother her?",S01E05,38
In the kitchen.,S01E05,39
All right. Thanks,S01E05,40
"Hey, Teddy bear.",S01E05,41
"Hey, Emmett.",S01E05,42
"You know this dance this Friday night isgirls ask guys, right?",S01E05,43
Uh-huh.,S01E05,44
You're a girl.,S01E05,45
I'm a guy.,S01E05,46
Something you want to ask me?,S01E05,47
"Okay, Emmett, listen,",S01E05,48
P.,S01E05,49
J.,S01E05,50
is my brother and you're his best friend.,S01E05,51
So in a way you're kind of like my brother too.,S01E05,52
And I can't go to the dance with my brother.,S01E05,53
"You can see why that would be wrong, right?",S01E05,54
This is the longest conversation we've ever had.,S01E05,55
Did you hear anything I just said?,S01E05,56
Something about wanting to go to the dance with a brother.,S01E05,57
"Emmett, I want you to listen to me very carefully.",S01E05,58
I'm not going to ask you to the dance.,S01E05,59
When you touch me it feels like electricity.,S01E05,60
Today's all burnt toast{\i0},S01E05,61
"Running late, and dad jokes{\i0}",S01E05,62
Has anybody seen my left shoe{\i0},S01E05,63
"I close my eyes, take a bite{\i0}",S01E05,64
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud{\i0}",S01E05,65
There it is up on the roof{\i0},S01E05,66
"I've been there, I've survived{\i0}",S01E05,67
So just take my advice{\i0},S01E05,68
"Hang in there, baby,{\i0}",S01E05,69
Things are crazy{\i0},S01E05,70
But I know your future is bright{\i0},S01E05,71
"Hang in there, Baby{\i0}",S01E05,72
There is no maybe{\i0},S01E05,73
Eveything turns out all right{\i0},S01E05,74
Sure life is up and down{\i0},S01E05,75
"But trust me, it comes back all around{\i0}",S01E05,76
You're gonna love who you turn out to be{\i0},S01E05,77
"Hang in there, Baby{\i0}",S01E05,78
"Hi, kids.",S01E05,79
"Hey, mom.",S01E05,80
"Come on, Charlie, let's go see daddy.",S01E05,81
You know what I realized today?,S01E05,82
Charlie's never played laser tag.,S01E05,83
I bet she'd enjoy doing that on Friday night.,S01E05,84
"Oh, how very sweet and unselfish of you.",S01E05,85
But Charlie's gonna be with us Friday night.,S01E05,86
It's your school's open house.,S01E05,87
Right.,S01E05,88
Forgot about that.,S01E05,89
"Well, we haven't.",S01E05,90
Dad and I can't wait to meet this miracle worker--Mrs.,S01E05,91
Mellish.,S01E05,92
She's the first teacher who hasn't called to complain about you.,S01E05,93
Are you sure he's actually going to school?,S01E05,94
"Mom, you've been to so many open houses.",S01E05,95
And you'd love laser tag.,S01E05,96
It's like a workout but you get to shoot stuff.,S01E05,97
"Oh, come on, we can play laser tag anytime.",S01E05,98
Meeting a teacher that has no problems with you--,S01E05,99
That may never happen again.,S01E05,100
This is bad.,S01E05,101
What's bad?,S01E05,102
The only reason I haven't been getting in trouble,S01E05,103
Is that I told my teacher mom and dad have been fighting a lot.,S01E05,104
That actually works?,S01E05,105
You also have to give the teacher one of these.,S01E05,106
"Wow, that's good.",S01E05,107
I almost hugged you.,S01E05,108
And I never want to hug you.,S01E05,109
Works even better on Mrs.,S01E05,110
Mellish.,S01E05,111
Any time I do something wrong--,S01E05,112
Mommy and daddy were fighting again.,S01E05,113
Wow.,S01E05,114
"Well, I guess your evil plan is gonna be over on Friday night,",S01E05,115
'cause mom and dad won't be fighting.,S01E05,116
Or will they?,S01E05,117
So who are you asking to the dance?,S01E05,118
"Okay, here's a hint. He's really cute and--",S01E05,119
You ladies talking about me again?,S01E05,120
"You know I'm not talking about you,",S01E05,121
Since I dumped your sorry butt a long time ago.,S01E05,122
That's now how me and my sorry butt remember it.,S01E05,123
Remind me again why you ever went out with him.,S01E05,124
Only one way to explain it--,S01E05,125
Brain fart.,S01E05,126
Brain fart.,S01E05,127
So who's this cutie you're gonna ask?,S01E05,128
Spencer.,S01E05,129
"Oh, right,",S01E05,130
Mr.,S01E05,131
Almost first kiss.,S01E05,132
You'd better get moving on that.,S01E05,133
Your window is closing.,S01E05,134
What window?,S01E05,135
The window of opportunity.,S01E05,136
"Oh, thanks.",S01E05,137
That really clears things up.,S01E05,138
"T, you almost kissed this guy,",S01E05,139
But nothing happened since then.,S01E05,140
"If you don't act soon, you're doomed to be just friends.",S01E05,141
"I like Spencer, he likes me,",S01E05,142
And I'll ask him when the time is right.,S01E05,143
"That better be right now, chica,",S01E05,144
Because Lauren Sandoval is gonna ask him.,S01E05,145
Lauren would never do that to me.,S01E05,146
She's too good a friend.,S01E05,147
There's your good friend right now.,S01E05,148
Here? Walking up to Spencer,S01E05,149
What? That little witch!,S01E05,150
Yeah!,S01E05,151
"Oh, Lauren, you poor thing.",S01E05,152
"What a horrible, ugly tomatoey mess you are.",S01E05,153
"Come on, pizza face, let's get you cleaned up.",S01E05,154
Come on.,S01E05,155
"Oh, Spencer, hey.",S01E05,156
Didn't see you there.,S01E05,157
"Hi, Teddy.",S01E05,158
"Boy, that pizza really came out of nowhere, huh?",S01E05,159
Yeah.,S01E05,160
Nice shot.,S01E05,161
It's all in the wrist.,S01E05,162
Now tell me again,S01E05,163
And don't leave out a single detail--,S01E05,164
What exactly did Spencer say when you asked him?,S01E05,165
"He said, and I quote,",S01E05,166
Okay.,S01E05,167
"Oh, wouldn't it be so romantic",S01E05,168
If I got my first kiss during a slow dance?,S01E05,169
That could happen if you don't wear that red polka dot thing,S01E05,170
That makes you look like a clown.,S01E05,171
"No no, you're right.",S01E05,172
I should dress more subtle and understated,S01E05,173
Like you.,S01E05,174
That's all I'm saying.,S01E05,175
Now I just have to figure out,S01E05,176
How Spencer and I are gonna get to the dance.,S01E05,177
How are you getting there?,S01E05,178
I haven't asked anyone yet.,S01E05,179
I'm still trying to decide between five guys.,S01E05,180
"Well, do any of them drive?",S01E05,181
Let's see,S01E05,182
"Sophomore, freshman, sophomore,",S01E05,183
"Eighth-grader I don't really want to talk about,",S01E05,184
And sophomore.,S01E05,185
"So no, no drivers on the list.",S01E05,186
"That's too bad, because if you could find somebody who drives",S01E05,187
Then Spencer and I could double with you.,S01E05,188
"Yeah, consider it done. I'll just expand my list",S01E05,189
And lower my standards a little bit.,S01E05,190
Lower than the eighth grade?,S01E05,191
You want a ride or not?,S01E05,192
"Okay, they say it's gonna be chilly tonight.",S01E05,193
I want to make sure you're nice and toasty.,S01E05,194
Did I remember to change your diaper?,S01E05,195
I'm gonna go with yes.,S01E05,196
Are you ready to go?,S01E05,197
Yeah,S01E05,198
It is gonna be so nice to go to an open house,S01E05,199
And not to have to hear the words,S01E05,200
"Oh, you're Gabe's parents.",S01E05,201
"Mom, are you wearing perfume?",S01E05,202
I am.,S01E05,203
Oh.,S01E05,204
What? You don't like it?,S01E05,205
"Oh, I like it, but",S01E05,206
But what? Does someone else not like it?,S01E05,207
I don't want to get dad in trouble.,S01E05,208
"Wait, dad says he doesn't like my perfume?",S01E05,209
He doesn't just say it.,S01E05,210
He makes a face too.,S01E05,211
And sometimes there's gagging.,S01E05,212
Oh.,S01E05,213
"Well, that's interesting.",S01E05,214
Has your father shared anything else with you,S01E05,215
About how I disgust him?,S01E05,216
I've said too much already.,S01E05,217
"Oh, okay.",S01E05,218
Okay.,S01E05,219
"Nice jacket, dad.",S01E05,220
Isn't it? Got my company logo right there--,S01E05,221
Free advertising and a great conversation starter.,S01E05,222
Does mom know you're wearing it?,S01E05,223
"Oh, I've been dressing myself for some time now.",S01E05,224
"So no, I didn't run it by her.",S01E05,225
"Oh, I guess she'll just have to live with it.",S01E05,226
Why? Is there a problem?,S01E05,227
"I don't want to get mom in trouble,",S01E05,228
"But just between us,",S01E05,229
She thinks you talk too much about your job.,S01E05,230
I talk too much about my job--,S01E05,231
The same job that puts a roof over your mother's head?,S01E05,232
"Hey, I'm on your side.",S01E05,233
So what else does she say about me behind my back?,S01E05,234
I've said too much already.,S01E05,235
"Come on, guys.",S01E05,236
Gotta go.,S01E05,237
Gonna be late.,S01E05,238
"Well, we're taking the bug truck,",S01E05,239
If that's okay with you.,S01E05,240
As long as the windows work.,S01E05,241
I don't want to trigger anyone's gag reflex.,S01E05,242
Women.,S01E05,243
"Hey, good luck at your open house tonight.",S01E05,244
Good luck at whatever you're dressed so weird for.,S01E05,245
Look at you.,S01E05,246
"Oh, no, look at you.",S01E05,247
"Well, I wish I was someone else",S01E05,248
So I could look at both of us.,S01E05,249
So where's your date?,S01E05,250
Parking the car.,S01E05,251
"Oh, I like it. Who is he?",S01E05,252
"Okay, about that-- there's something you should know--",S01E05,253
'sup?,S01E05,254
"Emmett, would you excuse us for a minute real quick?",S01E05,255
"Okay, just--",S01E05,256
Emmett?,S01E05,257
We needed transportation.,S01E05,258
It was either emmett or an eighth-grader,S01E05,259
With a skateboard.,S01E05,260
"Let's just go have a good time, okay?",S01E05,261
Shall we?,S01E05,262
Teddy bear.,S01E05,263
Grizzly bear.,S01E05,264
You look really nice.,S01E05,265
You are really nice.,S01E05,266
Thanks.,S01E05,267
Whose car is this?,S01E05,268
My grandpa's.,S01E05,269
He thinks I'm at the store getting bread.,S01E05,270
But instead,S01E05,271
You'll be at the dance getting nothing.,S01E05,272
"Wow, looks like my seat belt's broken.",S01E05,273
Maybe I should sit in the middle.,S01E05,274
Is that okay?,S01E05,275
Yeah.,S01E05,276
'cause I'm all about safety.,S01E05,277
"Teddy, you're blocking my view.",S01E05,278
You mind moving away from Spencer?,S01E05,279
"Big guy, lean the other way.",S01E05,280
More.,S01E05,281
More.,S01E05,282
"Emmett, if he leans any more, he'll fall out of the car.",S01E05,283
More.,S01E05,284
"Well, this is my classroom.",S01E05,285
Mrs.,S01E05,286
Mellish looks busy.,S01E05,287
Maybe we should come back next year.,S01E05,288
"Whoa, p-u alert.",S01E05,289
"I get it, okay?",S01E05,290
I'm talking about Charlie's diaper. What's her problem?,S01E05,291
Heck if I know.,S01E05,292
"And for your information,",S01E05,293
Some people find that scent very pleasant.,S01E05,294
A full diaper?,S01E05,295
I'm gonna be back in a minute.,S01E05,296
"I'm gonna go change Charlie, okay?",S01E05,297
Okay,S01E05,298
"Hi, Gabe.",S01E05,299
"Hi, Mrs.",S01E05,300
Mellish.,S01E05,301
How is my brave little soldier?,S01E05,302
Not good.,S01E05,303
mom and dad are fighting again.,S01E05,304
"Oh, you poor thing.",S01E05,305
They've been fighting all week.,S01E05,306
I don't think I can get that book report into time you on Tuesday.,S01E05,307
"That's okay, dear.",S01E05,308
You take all the time you need.,S01E05,309
I don't need time.,S01E05,310
I need happiness.,S01E05,311
Oh.,S01E05,312
All right.,S01E05,313
That song was brought to you by Freddy's stereo hut.,S01E05,314
"When you're ready to rock steady, go see Freddy.",S01E05,315
P.,S01E05,316
J.,S01E05,317
", what's with all the commercials?.",S01E05,318
That's how I'm paying for all the equipment.,S01E05,319
I got some sponsors to buy advertising.,S01E05,320
Who would buy advertising from you?,S01E05,321
You'd be surprised.,S01E05,322
This next one is brought to you by mom,S01E05,323
Who gave me 20 bucks.,S01E05,324
"Mom-- when you absolutely, positively",S01E05,325
Can't get any more money out of dad.,S01E05,326
"Bob, come here, honey, look.",S01E05,327
Look at this picture Gabe drew.,S01E05,328
Isn't that sweet?,S01E05,329
"Yeah, it sure is. You know what, honey?",S01E05,330
I guess we're doing something right.,S01E05,331
Would you look at that?,S01E05,332
"Gabe, it seems like your parents are getting along.",S01E05,333
I'm gonna go introduce myself.,S01E05,334
Gotta think.,S01E05,335
gotta think.,S01E05,336
"It's go time, Ricky.",S01E05,337
"Excuse me, lady.",S01E05,338
You've got a rat on your shoulder.,S01E05,339
Rat on the loose!,S01E05,340
Remain calm.,S01E05,341
Remain calm.,S01E05,342
Remain calm.,S01E05,343
Remain calm.,S01E05,344
"Spencer, could you get me some punch, please?",S01E05,345
Sure.,S01E05,346
I'll be right back.,S01E05,347
"Emmett, why don't you go get me some punch too?",S01E05,348
"What, your feet don't work?",S01E05,349
Ice or no ice?,S01E05,350
Surprise me.,S01E05,351
I think it's time for me to make my move.,S01E05,352
"Go get that kiss, girl.",S01E05,353
"Hey, P.",S01E05,354
J.,S01E05,355
", put on a slow song, okay?.",S01E05,356
"You got it, sis.",S01E05,357
"Okay, we're gonna bring it down now,",S01E05,358
Just like you should bring yourselves down to Wally's Waffles.,S01E05,359
Tell them P.,S01E05,360
J.,S01E05,361
sent you.,S01E05,362
You can get a free pat of butter.,S01E05,363
Here you go.,S01E05,364
"Oh, thanks.",S01E05,365
Let's dance.,S01E05,366
"Yo, quick, throw on some hip-hop.",S01E05,367
But I just started this song.,S01E05,368
Now.,S01E05,369
"Okay, this next one is brought to you by Emmett.",S01E05,370
Emmett-- he's,S01E05,371
Standing right there.,S01E05,372
What just happened?,S01E05,373
Emmett stole my date.,S01E05,374
"Back we go, little guy,",S01E05,375
Safe and sound.,S01E05,376
"Boy, really tired.",S01E05,377
We should go.,S01E05,378
"Thank you, Mr.",S01E05,379
Duncan.,S01E05,380
That was very impressive.,S01E05,381
"Well, when you've been in the pest control biz",S01E05,382
"As long as I have, you--",S01E05,383
"You know, I really shouldn't talk about my work.",S01E05,384
It bugs my wife.,S01E05,385
"No, it doesn't. Why would you think that?",S01E05,386
Because Gabe told me it did.,S01E05,387
"Charlie looks more tired than me, so",S01E05,388
Gabe told me you hated my perfume.,S01E05,389
I never said that. What are you talking about?,S01E05,390
"Oh, please don't do this here.",S01E05,391
Isn't it bad enough that poor Gabe has to listen,S01E05,392
To you two constantly fighting at home?,S01E05,393
We don't fight at home.,S01E05,394
We're very happy.,S01E05,395
Look at this picture Gabe drew of our family.,S01E05,396
That's not his.,S01E05,397
That's Gabe M's.,S01E05,398
This is Gabe D's.,S01E05,399
That's disturbing.,S01E05,400
Mrs.,S01E05,401
"mellish, I assure you we're a very loving family.",S01E05,402
"Gabe, get your butt over here.",S01E05,403
Now why would you tell your teacher that we're fighting at home.,S01E05,404
So I could get out of doing my work.,S01E05,405
"I'm in big trouble, right?",S01E05,406
"Oh, yeah.",S01E05,407
Have all your overdue assignments on my desk Monday morning.,S01E05,408
But that'll take me the whole weekend.,S01E05,409
You poor thing.,S01E05,410
Get your coat.,S01E05,411
We're leaving.,S01E05,412
I can't believe we let him play us like that.,S01E05,413
I know. How could I ever think you didn't like my perfume?,S01E05,414
"Well, it's not my favorite.",S01E05,415
Said the guy with the cartoon cockroach on his blazer.,S01E05,416
It's an ant.,S01E05,417
"Man, your jerking is dope.",S01E05,418
"Man, your popping-- sick.",S01E05,419
I'd like to pop both of these jerks.,S01E05,420
Sorry you didn't get that kiss.,S01E05,421
"Yeah, well, the night's not over yet.",S01E05,422
Follow my lead.,S01E05,423
"Hey, what's that noise?",S01E05,424
What noise?,S01E05,425
The noise teddy is talking about.,S01E05,426
Sounds like it's coming from the back of the car.,S01E05,427
"Yeah, I hear it too.",S01E05,428
It sounds bad.,S01E05,429
You should probably pull over and check it out.,S01E05,430
- I'm telling you--  - Stop the car!,S01E05,431
"Just come on, I'll show you where the noise is coming from.",S01E05,432
I know where the noise is coming from.,S01E05,433
You want to keep that head?,S01E05,434
I suggest you not do that again.,S01E05,435
"Oh, sorry, sorry.",S01E05,436
In my head that went a lot smoother.,S01E05,437
Hello there.,S01E05,438
Hi.,S01E05,439
"Look, I'm sorry I got so caught up with Emmett and the dancing.",S01E05,440
I kind of like the way things were going before then.,S01E05,441
"Yeah, me too.",S01E05,442
I'm glad we got to go to the dance together.,S01E05,443
I was a little nervous because,S01E05,444
Ivy said my window closing.,S01E05,445
And then Lauren Sandoval almost asked you.,S01E05,446
and then Ivy and Emmett showed up at my house,S01E05,447
"And I was like, oh, no.",S01E05,448
how is it gonna working.,S01E05,449
And I just--,S01E05,450
That was a really nice way of telling me to shut up.,S01E05,451
"Well, Charlie, I finally got my first kiss tonight",S01E05,452
And now I can't stop smiling.,S01E05,453
I mean who knew that Emmett's grandpa's car,S01E05,454
Would turn out to be the most romantic place in the world?,S01E05,455
"Okay, I'm gonna try and stop smiling.",S01E05,456
"No, I can't do it.",S01E05,457
"Man, look at that girl working.",S01E05,458
Wow.,S01E05,459
I thought we were good.,S01E05,460
Not as good as that.,S01E05,461
She's got it going on.,S01E05,462
"So then Spencer said,",S01E06,0
Are you coming to my party tonight?,S01E06,1
"And inside I was like, Waah!",S01E06,2
"But on the outside I was like, Sure, whatevs.",S01E06,3
"So then I said, What should I bring?",S01E06,4
"And he said, Just your cute self.",S01E06,5
"And that time I did say, Waah!",S01E06,6
"Hi, honey.",S01E06,7
"Oh, hey, mom.",S01E06,8
Homework call.,S01E06,9
Sorry. Where's charlie?,S01E06,10
"Kitchen, with Gabe.",S01E06,11
Charlie did it.,S01E06,12
What in the world?,S01E06,13
"Well, charlie asked for a milkshake.",S01E06,14
"Like a good big brother, I decided to make one.",S01E06,15
Then she forgot to put the top on the blender.,S01E06,16
So you put your baby sister in charge of an electrical appliance?,S01E06,17
And she let me down.,S01E06,18
"Teddy, get in here.",S01E06,19
"Mom, I'm on the-- wow.",S01E06,20
Gotta call you back.,S01E06,21
Care to explain what's going on here?,S01E06,22
"Uh, a chocolate bomb went off?",S01E06,23
I asked if we could make milkshakes,S01E06,24
And teddy did this.,S01E06,25
And then she started talking about her party again.,S01E06,26
That's what we call homework sometimes-- a party-- cause it's so fun.,S01E06,27
"Okay, you know what? That's it.",S01E06,28
No T.,S01E06,29
V.,S01E06,30
", no computer, no video games.",S01E06,31
For the rest of the day.,S01E06,32
I think that's fair.,S01E06,33
And you're watching him.,S01E06,34
That's so unfair!,S01E06,35
And Charlie.,S01E06,36
"Mom, I have to get ready for my party.",S01E06,37
That's just too bad. And what did I tell you about lying?,S01E06,38
It only works on dad.,S01E06,39
"Now both of you, clean this mess up.",S01E06,40
My poor little baby.,S01E06,41
I gotta give you a bath.,S01E06,42
Mwah.,S01E06,43
Or I could just lick you clean.,S01E06,44
Today's all burnt toast{\i0},S01E06,45
"Running late, and dad jokes{\i0}",S01E06,46
Has anybody seen my left shoe{\i0},S01E06,47
"I close my eyes, take a bite{\i0}",S01E06,48
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud{\i0}",S01E06,49
There it is up on the roof{\i0},S01E06,50
"I've been there, I've survived{\i0}",S01E06,51
So just take my advice{\i0},S01E06,52
"Hang in there, baby,{\i0}",S01E06,53
Things are crazy{\i0},S01E06,54
But I know your future is bright{\i0},S01E06,55
"Hang in there, Baby{\i0}",S01E06,56
There is no maybe{\i0},S01E06,57
Eveything turns out all right{\i0},S01E06,58
Sure life is up and down{\i0},S01E06,59
"But trust me, it comes back all around{\i0}",S01E06,60
You're gonna love who you turn out to be{\i0},S01E06,61
"Hang in there, Baby{\i0}",S01E06,62
"Good morning, dad.",S01E06,63
you gonna get to that lawn today?,S01E06,64
"You know, when someone says Good morning,",S01E06,65
The traditional response is Good morning back.,S01E06,66
Sorry.,S01E06,67
You gonna get to that lawn today?,S01E06,68
So where you off to?,S01E06,69
"I'm meeting with some jingle writers,",S01E06,70
Getting ready to shoot a new commercial for bob's bugs be gone.,S01E06,71
"A jingle? That's like a song, right?",S01E06,72
"That's right, a catchy little tune that sticks in your head",S01E06,73
And drives you just a little bit crazy.,S01E06,74
"You know emmett and I have a band, right?",S01E06,75
"You know we have a lawn mower, right?",S01E06,76
Don't you think you should give us a shot at writing your jingle?,S01E06,77
P.,S01E06,78
J.,S01E06,79
", come on, music's a great hobby for you,.",S01E06,80
but I need a professional.,S01E06,81
"Come on, just give us a chance.",S01E06,82
"All right, okay.",S01E06,83
"If you guys wanna take a shot at it, knock yourselves out.",S01E06,84
You will not be sorry.,S01E06,85
"And then one day when I accept my grammy for best exterminator jingle,",S01E06,86
"I'm gonna say,",S01E06,87
"This one's for you, dad.",S01E06,88
And my girlfriend Taylor Swift.,S01E06,89
"What up, Tay-tay?",S01E06,90
What's wrong with you?,S01E06,91
No t.,S01E06,92
V.,S01E06,93
", no computer, no video games.",S01E06,94
I'm freaking out.,S01E06,95
Why don't you read a book?,S01E06,96
"Sure, right after I clean my room.",S01E06,97
Do you even know me?,S01E06,98
You're a strange little dude.,S01E06,99
Where are you going?,S01E06,100
To the store.,S01E06,101
We're out of diapers.,S01E06,102
Please take me with you.,S01E06,103
You wanna go shopping for diapers?,S01E06,104
"No, but I will not stay here and have these machines mock me.",S01E06,105
"Again, a strange little dude.",S01E06,106
"Okay, read back what we have so far.",S01E06,107
"Okay. Jingle number one,",S01E06,108
Written by P.,S01E06,109
J.,S01E06,110
And emmett.,S01E06,111
That's it.,S01E06,112
Think.,S01E06,113
Gotta think.,S01E06,114
"Oh, hey, my dad's name is bob.",S01E06,115
Maybe we should think of things that rhyme with Bob.,S01E06,116
"How about blob, glob and slob?",S01E06,117
I'm doing a load of his whites.,S01E06,118
"Man, writing a jingle is harder than I thought.",S01E06,119
"Mom, we need some inspiration.",S01E06,120
"Well, lucky for you,",S01E06,121
I wrote quite a bit of poetry in high school.,S01E06,122
Published five times in the school's literary magazine--,S01E06,123
Whatever.,S01E06,124
"Actually, I was thinking",S01E06,125
You could inspire us with some sandwiches.,S01E06,126
My first piece or-- back it up--,S01E06,127
Should I say my first published piece,S01E06,128
Is called simply Locker.,S01E06,129
That's great. I'll take a ham and cheese--,S01E06,130
"Hey there, locker,",S01E06,131
Filled with my books and papers,S01E06,132
And secrets.,S01E06,133
I can't remember your combination.,S01E06,134
"37 right, 17 left,",S01E06,135
But then what?,S01E06,136
Am I locked out,S01E06,137
Or are you locked in?,S01E06,138
So good.,S01E06,139
So good.,S01E06,140
It's still so good.,S01E06,141
You wanna do this at my house?,S01E06,142
"Well well well,",S01E06,143
Gabriel B.,S01E06,144
Duncan.,S01E06,145
"Afternoon, hugo.",S01E06,146
The manager knows you?,S01E06,147
"We have a history, yes.",S01E06,148
"A word of advice, Duncan--",S01E06,149
"You knock over a display or joy-ride a shopping cart,",S01E06,150
And I will personally open a can of Reddi Mart's finest butt-kick.,S01E06,151
"Hey, have you lost weight?",S01E06,152
Just kidding.,S01E06,153
"I'm watching you, punk.",S01E06,154
Soda and mints? What are these for?,S01E06,155
I'm gonna make a soda geyser.,S01E06,156
You drop a mint into the bottle,S01E06,157
And it makes this huge explosion.,S01E06,158
"Wow, that sounds so cool.",S01E06,159
Put them back.,S01E06,160
How come you get to buy lip gloss and I can't buy this stuff?,S01E06,161
It's completely different.,S01E06,162
Soda and mints won't make you look totally cute at a party.,S01E06,163
Thank you very much.,S01E06,164
What's going on?,S01E06,165
"Why, it's gabe.",S01E06,166
I must be getting psychic.,S01E06,167
I didn't do anything.,S01E06,168
"Mm-hmm, come on.",S01E06,169
Receipt.,S01E06,170
There you go.,S01E06,171
"Huh, I'm seeing diapers,",S01E06,172
But I'm not seeing sunglasses.,S01E06,173
Explain.,S01E06,174
Explanation-- we didn't get sunglasses.,S01E06,175
"Well, someone did.",S01E06,176
Charlie did it.,S01E06,177
This time she really did do it.,S01E06,178
She must have grabbed these when we weren't looking.,S01E06,179
That's so funny.,S01E06,180
You see me laughing?,S01E06,181
There's nothing funny about shoplifting.,S01E06,182
"In case you didn't notice, hugo, we're still in the store.",S01E06,183
Unpaid items are considered stolen once they leave checkout.,S01E06,184
"In case you didn't notice,",S01E06,185
we don't have cash registers in the parking lot.,S01E06,186
Tell alice to call the police.,S01E06,187
The police? You're arresting a baby?,S01E06,188
Or a very small person.,S01E06,189
We don't have all the facts yet.,S01E06,190
Turn her to the left.,S01E06,191
Don't you think it's a little ridiculous to take mug shots of a baby?,S01E06,192
That's procedure for shoplifters.,S01E06,193
Turn her to the right.,S01E06,194
"Okay, Charlie, smile for Huge-oh.",S01E06,195
Sticks and stones may break my bones--,S01E06,196
Agh!,S01E06,197
Are these the shoplifters?,S01E06,198
That's right.,S01E06,199
The perp is in the stroller.,S01E06,200
She's not a perp.,S01E06,201

"Oh, dad, I actually need to ask you guys about something.",S01E07,166
Is it okay if Ivy and I go to a midnight movie on Thursday?,S01E07,167
"Thursday? No way, it's a school night.",S01E07,168
"Bob, honey, you don't understand, okay?",S01E07,169
This isn't just any movie.,S01E07,170
This is Dusk.,S01E07,171
- What's that? - Hello!,S01E07,172
The movie about the vampires.,S01E07,173
The prequel to Dawn.,S01E07,174
So lame!,S01E07,175
"All right, you know what? You wanna let her go, let her go.",S01E07,176
"- Okay! Thank you, daddy.",S01E07,177
"Thank you, girlfriend.",S01E07,178
- Teddy.,S01E07,179
Call me!,S01E07,180
What's that in your hair?,S01E07,181
It's called glitter.,S01E07,182
"Get with it, grandpa.",S01E07,183
Emmett! Thank you.,S01E07,184
I can't believe I have to do this whole chemistry project by myself.,S01E07,185
Stupid Van Brundt!,S01E07,186
"Hey, don't call him stupid.",S01E07,187
That's an insult to stupid people everywhere.,S01E07,188
"That idiot can't even count to 10,",S01E07,189
"Which, coincidentally, is the number of years he's going to be in high school.",S01E07,190
Guess that's my phone.,S01E07,191
"Oh, that's weird.",S01E07,192
It says I have a call in progress.,S01E07,193
You probably sat on it and butt-dialed someone.,S01E07,194
Hello? Nobody there.,S01E07,195
Must have gotten voicemail.,S01E07,196
Who'd you dial?,S01E07,197
Van Brundt. Van Brundt!,S01E07,198
He's gonna hear everything we just said about him!,S01E07,199
You mean he's going to hear everything you just said about him.,S01E07,200
"We were both talking about him, Emmett.",S01E07,201
Stop saying my name!,S01E07,202
- And hang up the phone!  - Yes!,S01E07,203
- Hey! - Hey.,S01E07,204
So did my evil plan work? Did you butter up your mom?,S01E07,205
Like popcorn at a midnight movie!,S01E07,206
What was that?,S01E07,207
"Oh, it's just my phone.",S01E07,208
It's always making weird noises.,S01E07,209
So how'd you do it?,S01E07,210
"Oh, it was so painful.",S01E07,211
I had to spend the whole day with her pretending she was cool.,S01E07,212
Longest day of my life.,S01E07,213
But it was all worth it,S01E07,214
Because we're going to see Dusk!,S01E07,215
"When the sun goes down, his fangs come out.",S01E07,216
And his shirt comes off!,S01E07,217
It was all just a big trick so,S01E07,218
Teddy could get permission to see that vampire movie.,S01E07,219
"Bob, she thinks I'm just as uncool as I thought my mom was.",S01E07,220
It's the great uncool circle of life.,S01E07,221
"Well, honey, if it helps, I think you're cool.",S01E07,222
It doesn't.,S01E07,223
"All right, so what's the punishment going to be?",S01E07,224
"No movie, grounded for a week?",S01E07,225
Too easy.,S01E07,226
Mama's going to get even.,S01E07,227
You know nothing good ever happens,S01E07,228
When you start calling yourself mama.,S01E07,229
Mama doesn't care.,S01E07,230
There he is.,S01E07,231
Guess we should just go in there and get it over with.,S01E07,232
"Man, I hate getting beat up.",S01E07,233
You've been beat up before?,S01E07,234
"No, but I've heard bad things.",S01E07,235
"Hey, duncan, get in here!",S01E07,236
How are you doing on our project?,S01E07,237
Okay.,S01E07,238
That's all you wanted to talk about?,S01E07,239
"Oh, I'm sorry.",S01E07,240
I love what you've done with your hair.,S01E07,241
So Heard any interesting phone messages lately?,S01E07,242
"No, mrs.",S01E07,243
Jeter caught me texting in class and took my phone away.,S01E07,244
- Ohh.  - What?!,S01E07,245
That that's terrible. Don't you hate it when people just take your phone,S01E07,246
And put it where exactly?,S01E07,247
It's in her desk.,S01E07,248
I'm getting it back at the end of the day.,S01E07,249
I'm tired of talking!,S01E07,250
- Hey.,S01E07,251
- Hey.,S01E07,252
Aren't you home from school a little early?,S01E07,253
We've got a helicopter to fly.,S01E07,254
And I'm only missing P.,S01E07,255
E.,S01E07,256
And English and math.,S01E07,257
"All right, let's get this bird in the air.",S01E07,258
- Whoa! - How'd you do that?,S01E07,259
- I don't know. - Is it voice-activated?,S01E07,260
Uh Stop.,S01E07,261
Down!,S01E07,262
- No.  - Whoa!,S01E07,263
You must have put it together wrong.,S01E07,264
"No no, that's impossible.",S01E07,265
I followed all the instructions.,S01E07,266
- Where's the remote?  - I don't know!,S01E07,267
"Oh, dad, do something!",S01E07,268
I am I'm making a run for it!,S01E07,269
"Okay, the coast is clear.",S01E07,270
Let's go.,S01E07,271
Just get the phone and get out of here.,S01E07,272
"Okay, I got it.",S01E07,273
Let's go.,S01E07,274
"Oh, jeez!",S01E07,275
- Here you go.  - What do you mean!?,S01E07,276
I don't know what to do.,S01E07,277
Put it away.,S01E07,278
"- That attitude better change, buddy.",S01E07,279
"- Yes, ma'am.",S01E07,280
What are you boys doing in here?,S01E07,281
We had a chemistry question.,S01E07,282
- Which is?  - Ahem,S01E07,283
We were wondering,S01E07,284
What's boron made of.,S01E07,285
Boron.,S01E07,286
Told ya!,S01E07,287
"Well, I stand corrected.",S01E07,288
Can I have my phone now?,S01E07,289
Here you go.,S01E07,290
Wait a minute where's my phone?,S01E07,291
"George, can I make a quick call on your phone?",S01E07,292
Please?,S01E07,293
Thank you.,S01E07,294
- Whoops. - What's wrong with you?,S01E07,295
I guess I'm the boron now.,S01E07,296
- You owe me a phone!  - Gladly.,S01E07,297

Hello?,S01E07,303
Hold on.,S01E07,304
It's for you.,S01E07,305
I can't believe we're here! This is like a dream.,S01E07,306
"A dream where we get to flirt with cute guys,",S01E07,307
Watch a movie about cute guys,S01E07,308
While sitting next to cute guys.,S01E07,309
The midnight showing of Dusk is sold out.,S01E07,310
Oh no.,S01E07,311
- What?  - Look!,S01E07,312
"- Hey, girlfriend!  - Hey hey.",S01E07,313
What are you doing here?,S01E07,314
"What am I doing? I'm hanging out with my BFD,",S01E07,315
My best friend daughter. Right?,S01E07,316
"'cause that's what all the cool moms do, right, Mary Lou?",S01E07,317
All night long!,S01E07,318
"Whoo, Ivy! Isn't that Randall, the boy you think is soooo cute?",S01E07,319
"- Mom, keep your voice down. - Hey, Randall,",S01E07,320
This is my daughter Ivy.,S01E07,321
She's single and loves to mingle.,S01E07,322
Mary Lou!,S01E07,323
You're so cute.,S01E07,324
Randall can't hear you.,S01E07,325
"Hey, everybody! I'm Amy Duncan, Teddy duncan's mom.",S01E07,326
And I'm Mary Lou Wentz and this is my daughter Ivy.,S01E07,327
"We're the cool moms. Right, Teddy?",S01E07,328
"Hit it, Mary Lou.",S01E07,329
- I can't look.,S01E07,330
"- Oh, good choice.",S01E07,331
Because right now they're doing the Usher bump.,S01E07,332
"Okay, you did not say a word the entire ride home.",S01E07,333
Out with it.,S01E07,334
You totally embarrassed me tonight.,S01E07,335
"Yeah, that was kind of the idea.",S01E07,336
Look at me.,S01E07,337
Why? What did I ever do to you?,S01E07,338
"You played me, Teddy.",S01E07,339
You don't think I'm cool at all.,S01E07,340
Why why would you think that?,S01E07,341
Because I heard you say it.,S01E07,342
- When you butt-dialed me. - I,S01E07,343
Oh!,S01E07,344
"Yeah, oh.",S01E07,345
"I don't know what to say, mom.",S01E07,346
I'm sorry.,S01E07,347
That's a start.,S01E07,348
I should have never done that.,S01E07,349
I feel awful.,S01E07,350
Now I'm feeling better.,S01E07,351
"Well, do me a favor. In the future",S01E07,352
"When I do something stupid,",S01E07,353
Could you just ground me like a normal mom?,S01E07,354
"Oh, Teddy.",S01E07,355
I think we've established I'll never be a normal mom.,S01E07,356
"Van Brundt. Hey, what's up?",S01E07,357
"- Got a new phone. - Oh, right, how much do I owe you?",S01E07,358
Do you know when you get a new phone you can check your old messages?,S01E07,359
"Well, that doesn't sound right.",S01E07,360
I heard what you said about me. All of it!,S01E07,361
"Okay, what are you going to do to us?",S01E07,362
I'm going to let you choose.,S01E07,363
- I made a list.,S01E07,364
- Wow.,S01E07,365
You're pretty organized for a bully.,S01E07,366
"I don't mean to correct you, but there's no j in gouge.",S01E07,367
Let's go with number five.,S01E07,368
At least it's not painful.,S01E07,369
"- Two number fives, please.",S01E07,370
- Thank you.,S01E07,371
We butt-dialed van Brundt.,S01E07,372
I didn't say stop.,S01E07,373
"Okay, whirlybird, this is your final mission.",S01E07,374
Take happy happy horse far far away.,S01E07,375
"Launch three, two, one.",S01E07,376

"Hey, Charlie, so",S01E07,389

"If you ever want to fool a parent,",S01E07,391
"And make them think they're cool, dad is definitely the way to go.",S01E07,392
Just ask him about his job and pretend you're interested.,S01E07,393
Heard that.,S01E07,394
You're grounded.,S01E07,395
Baby monitor!,S01E07,396
Stupid technology.,S01E07,397
Heard that too.,S01E07,398
"Yeah, I can't even imagine",S01E07,399
"What kind of gadgets they'll have when you're a teenager, so",S01E07,400
"Good luck, Charlie.",S01E07,401
"Hey, honey.",S01E07,402
Here we go.,S01E07,403
Careful it's hot.,S01E07,404
I had a little quick question to ask you.,S01E07,405
"Sure, mom, what's up?",S01E07,406
"Okay, I want you just to be totally honest with me.",S01E07,407
"I am cooler than Mary Lou Wentz, right?",S01E07,408
"Of course you are, mom.",S01E07,409
"Now tell me the truth. I am cooler than Amy Duncan, right?",S01E07,410
Definitely.,S01E07,411
"Hey, sweetheart.",S01E07,412
"Yeah, I'm talking to you.",S01E07,413
"Listen, we got a problem with your brother.",S01E07,414
"Not him, the little one",S01E07,415
with the big mouth.,S01E07,416
- You just talking with Charlie? - What?,S01E07,417
Never mind.,S01E07,418
"Anyway, that little stinker was trying to get rid of me.",S01E07,419
I say we get rid of him.,S01E07,420
'cause that would make me,S01E07,421
a happy happy horse,S01E07,422
happy happy happy horse.,S01E07,423
Stupid horse.,S01E07,424
"Watch your back, kid.",S01E07,425
I'm a happy happy horse,S01E07,426
happy happy happy horse.,S01E07,427
"Well, Charlie, today is a very special day.",S01E08,0
It's your first birthday!,S01E08,1
The whole family's excited to celebrate.,S01E08,2
"Happy Birthday, sweetie.",S01E08,3
"I love you, baby girl.",S01E08,4
You're the best.,S01E08,5
I'm just here for the cake.,S01E08,6
"Well, four out of the five Duncans are excited.",S01E08,7
"Okay, who wants to give Charlie her first present?",S01E08,8
"Oh, I do, I do!",S01E08,9
I think p.,S01E08,10
J.,S01E08,11
Wants to go first.,S01E08,12
"Okay, you know how you said she needed something to sleep in?",S01E08,13
Well,S01E08,14
Get it? P.,S01E08,15
J.,S01E08,16
's pjs.,S01E08,17
"- Pretty cool, huh, dad?- Yeah, they're great.",S01E08,18
I'm glad you like them--because there was a two-for-one deal,S01E08,19
"Happy early birthday, dad.",S01E08,20
"Boy, those are gonna be tough to regift.",S01E08,21
"Your turn, Gabe.",S01E08,22
It's in the brown bag on the table.,S01E08,23
"Oooh, nice presentation.",S01E08,24
"Die, Zombies, Die?",S01E08,25
"Hey, you're never too young to learn how to kill zombies.",S01E08,26
"Okay, I'm next.",S01E08,27
"All right, let's see what we have here.",S01E08,28
So pretty.,S01E08,29
"Oh, baby.",S01E08,30
"Teddy, that is so sweet.",S01E08,31
"Well, it's no Die, Zombies, Die.",S01E08,32
"Hey, that's the picture we took the day Charlie was born.",S01E08,33
"What a crazy day, huh?",S01E08,34
It didn't start out that way.,S01E08,35
I remember how excited I was to be carrying my little bundle of joy.,S01E08,36
"Oh, I can't wait to get this thing out of here!",S01E08,37
You heard her-- get out.,S01E08,38
"She's talking about the baby. Right, mom?",S01E08,39
"Whoa, what is that smell?",S01E08,40
I'm pregnant.,S01E08,41
I have gas.,S01E08,42
Deal with it.,S01E08,43
"No, not that.",S01E08,44
It's worse.,S01E08,45
"No, actually that smell is coming from your lunch.",S01E08,46
Dad made his famous egg salad for your fishing trip today.,S01E08,47
Egg salad? Even the fish hate the smell of that.,S01E08,48
And they smell like fish.,S01E08,49
"Hey, p.",S01E08,50
J.,S01E08,51
", you ready to go have some fun?.",S01E08,52
"Yeah, but I have to go fishing with you.",S01E08,53
"Oh, hey, dad, can you drop me off at school?",S01E08,54
Ivy and I are doing our children's theater thing today,S01E08,55
- And we need to get into costumes.,S01E08,56
- Sure.,S01E08,57
"Oh, and, Gabe, if you're not doing anything you can come see it.",S01E08,58
"I wrote it, you know? It's a delightful fable",S01E08,59
About people from different worlds,S01E08,60
Who overcome their differences and become friends.,S01E08,61
Wow,S01E08,62
You actually made the fishing trip sound fun.,S01E08,63
Today's all burnt toast{\i0},S01E08,64
"Running late, and dad jokes{\i0}",S01E08,65
Has anybody seen my left shoe{\i0},S01E08,66
"I close my eyes, take a bite{\i0}",S01E08,67
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud{\i0}",S01E08,68
There it is up on the roof{\i0},S01E08,69
"I've been there, I've survived{\i0}",S01E08,70
So just take my advice{\i0},S01E08,71
"Hang in there, baby,{\i0}",S01E08,72
Things are crazy{\i0},S01E08,73
But I know your future is bright{\i0},S01E08,74
"Hang in there, Baby{\i0}",S01E08,75
There is no maybe{\i0},S01E08,76
Eveything turns out all right{\i0},S01E08,77
Sure life is up and down{\i0},S01E08,78
"But trust me, it comes back all around{\i0}",S01E08,79
You're gonna love who you turn out to be{\i0},S01E08,80
"Hang in there, Baby{\i0}",S01E08,81
A little more.,S01E08,82
And one for good luck.,S01E08,83
Oh oh!,S01E08,84
Really? Can't you at least wait until I finish my waffle?,S01E08,85
"Okay, we'll do it your way.",S01E08,86
"Bob, honey, it's time.",S01E08,87
The baby's coming.,S01E08,88
What?! You're not due for another three weeks.,S01E08,89
I'm in the middle of the lake.,S01E08,90
Would you please just calm down?,S01E08,91
I've done this three times already.,S01E08,92
I can do it a fourth.,S01E08,93
"And just so we're clear, there will not be a fifth.",S01E08,94
"PJ, we've got to get to the hospital.",S01E08,95
"- No no no, you can't stand up in the canoe. - Why not?",S01E08,96
Becau--,S01E08,97
"Hi, um, this is Amy Duncan.",S01E08,98
I'm calling for Dr.,S01E08,99
Singh.,S01E08,100
"Yes, could you please let him know that I have gone into labor?",S01E08,101
And to meet me at the hospital?,S01E08,102
"Okay, thank you very much.",S01E08,103
Bye-bye.,S01E08,104
"Okay, we're gonna do this barefoot.",S01E08,105
Let's go have a baby.,S01E08,106
Mom!,S01E08,107
Hello?,S01E08,108
Is anyone home?,S01E08,109
Then no one can tell me not to do this.,S01E08,110
Mmm!,S01E08,111
Mmm.,S01E08,112
"Okay, I tipped over the boat.",S01E08,113
How many times can I say I'm sorry?,S01E08,114
"We've got a 45-mile drive to the hospital, I guess we'll find out.",S01E08,115
- Is that a bear? - In the truck? How'd he get in there?,S01E08,116
"I don't know, son. Why don't you ask him?",S01E08,117
- How do we get him out? - We don't.,S01E08,118
He's the bear.,S01E08,119
He makes the decisions.,S01E08,120
"Dad, you're an exterminator.",S01E08,121
You should deal with this.,S01E08,122
I will-- when he loses 600 lbs and fits in a mousetrap.,S01E08,123
How are we gonna get to the hospital?,S01E08,124
Start walking.,S01E08,125
"Come on, let's go.",S01E08,126
"Oh, man! He ate all the egg salad sandwiches.",S01E08,127
"Oh, yes! I love that bear.",S01E08,128
"Oh, good, Halloween's come early this year.",S01E08,129
Who are you two supposed to be?,S01E08,130
I'm Frankenstein and she's Gretel.,S01E08,131
It's for a play I wrote.,S01E08,132
I don't get it.,S01E08,133
Neither did the audience.,S01E08,134
"What are you talking about? No, the kids loved it.",S01E08,135
Are you out of your flat head?,S01E08,136
It was a disaster.,S01E08,137
Then why were they cheering?,S01E08,138
Because we had to leave early.,S01E08,139
We're here to see Amy Duncan.,S01E08,140
Right in there.,S01E08,141
When Hansel and Dracula get here,S01E08,142
I'll send them in.,S01E08,143
"- Hey, mom.",S01E08,144
"- Hi, Frankenstein.",S01E08,145
Hi--,S01E08,146
I had the same reaction when I saw this wig.,S01E08,147
Contraction.,S01E08,148
"- Are you okay? - Super, great.",S01E08,149
Couldn't be better. All my ducks are in a row,S01E08,150
And everything's under control.,S01E08,151
So where's Gabe?,S01E08,152
I guess I left one of my ducks at home.,S01E08,153
"Wait, Gabe's home alone?",S01E08,154
"Oh, that is not good.",S01E08,155
"Gabe, you okay?",S01E08,156
I'm awesome!,S01E08,157
"Hey, check it out.",S01E08,158
"Hey hey, anybody here?",S01E08,159
"Dad, what are you doing?",S01E08,160
P.,S01E08,161
J.,S01E08,162
", we've got to get to the hospital.",S01E08,163
I'm just gonna see if I can hotwire one of these things.,S01E08,164
"Uh, dad!",S01E08,165
You trying to steal our bikes?,S01E08,166
Not steal-- hotwire.,S01E08,167
"No, look look look, before you do something you might regret,",S01E08,168
There is a perfectly good explanation.,S01E08,169
And I'd love to hear it,S01E08,170
Right after I gut you like a fish.,S01E08,171
You want your big knife or your really big knife?,S01E08,172
Surprise me.,S01E08,173
"Boy, Charlie's really loving her birthday cake.",S01E08,174
I know. Isn't it adorable?,S01E08,175
When she does it it's adorable.,S01E08,176
When I do it it's wrong.,S01E08,177
And that's because we were at a restaurant and it wasn't your cake.,S01E08,178
"Come on, let's get back to the story.",S01E08,179
Did the bikers gut you like a fish?,S01E08,180
- You were there.,S01E08,181
"- Oh, right.",S01E08,182
"All right, anyway, bikers were coming on strong,",S01E08,183
I had to come back stronger.,S01E08,184
Please don't hurt us.,S01E08,185
Please don't hurt us.,S01E08,186
Give us one good reason why we shouldn't.,S01E08,187
Because it would hurt.,S01E08,188
"Look look look, you don't understand.",S01E08,189
My wife is having a baby and there's a bear in our truck.,S01E08,190
That's why I'm trying to borrow the bike.,S01E08,191
I can't-- I can't miss the birth of my child.,S01E08,192
That's beautiful.,S01E08,193
We gotta help these people get to the hospital.,S01E08,194
He hasn't been the same since he took up needlepoint.,S01E08,195
"Oh, thank you.",S01E08,196
Thank you so much for helping us out.,S01E08,197
"By the way, I'm Bob.",S01E08,198
This is my son P.,S01E08,199
J.,S01E08,200
We're mad dog and Francis.,S01E08,201
"Good to meet you, mad dog.",S01E08,202
I'm Francis.,S01E08,203
She's mad dog.,S01E08,204
My real name's Shirley. If you call me that,S01E08,205
You'll gut him like a fish?,S01E08,206
You catch on real fast.,S01E08,207
Mrs.,S01E08,208
D.,S01E08,209
", can you keep it down a little bit?.",S01E08,210
I'm trying to win concert tickets.,S01E08,211
Where is he? I'm starting to get worried.,S01E08,212
"Okay, mom, relax.",S01E08,213
I'm sure dad's going to be here soon.,S01E08,214
Dad?! Who cares about dad?,S01E08,215
I'm talking about Dr.,S01E08,216
Singh.,S01E08,217
He's delivered all my children.,S01E08,218
"And, lady, I am not having this baby without him.",S01E08,219
"Frankenstein, can I talk to you a minute?",S01E08,220
Yep.,S01E08,221
- Dr.,S01E08,222
Singh's not here.,S01E08,223
- Not yet?.,S01E08,224
Not at all.,S01E08,225
He's taking a personal day.,S01E08,226
It's his son's birthday.,S01E08,227
So you mean he's not gonna be here.,S01E08,228
"Look, I know you have someone else's brain inside your head,",S01E08,229
So I'm gonna tell it to you slowly.,S01E08,230
Singh not coming.,S01E08,231
- Is everything okay? - Everything's great.,S01E08,232
Just one tiny glitch.,S01E08,233
- Dr.,S01E08,234
Singh's not coming.,S01E08,235
- Oh.,S01E08,236
"All right, fine.",S01E08,237
- So you're okay with this? - Of course.,S01E08,238
"Serious, mom, that's awesome, because I thought--",S01E08,239
- What are you doing?  - Going home.,S01E08,240
We'll just do this tomorrow when Dr.,S01E08,241
Singh can be here.,S01E08,242
"I don't think that's how it works, Mrs.",S01E08,243
D.,S01E08,244
"Oh, come on, the baby's been in here nine months,",S01E08,245
It can wait another day.,S01E08,246
"Ivy honey, be a dear and jam that shoe onto my foot.",S01E08,247
"Um, mom, please get back in bed.",S01E08,248
I am not gonna have this baby without Dr.,S01E08,249
Singh.,S01E08,250
"Okay okay, then we'll go get him.",S01E08,251
- You will? - We will.,S01E08,252
"Oh, that's so nice.",S01E08,253
"All right, let's roll, Gretel.",S01E08,254
"Oh good, more people get to see me.",S01E08,255
Yeehaw!,S01E08,256
New record!,S01E08,257
"Gabe, it's Mrs.",S01E08,258
Dabney.,S01E08,259
Open up.,S01E08,260
I'm not supposed to open the door to strangers.,S01E08,261
I wish we were strangers.,S01E08,262
Let me in.,S01E08,263
What is going on in here?,S01E08,264
Just the best day of my life.,S01E08,265
Party's over.,S01E08,266
Your sister called and asked me to bring you to the hospital.,S01E08,267
No way.,S01E08,268
I'm not going just to see some stupid baby,S01E08,269
Who I don't even want anyway.,S01E08,270
I see what's going on.,S01E08,271
Have a seat.,S01E08,272
I'm gonna tell you a story.,S01E08,273
"When I was four, I got a baby sister.",S01E08,274
Hated that girl from the first minute I laid eyes on her.,S01E08,275
I used to pull her hair,S01E08,276
And call her names and tease her till she cried.,S01E08,277
But we grew up and one thing led to another,S01E08,278
And after all these years I still can't stand her.,S01E08,279
How is that supposed to make me feel better?,S01E08,280
I didn't say it was going to make you feel better.,S01E08,281
I said I was going to tell you a story.,S01E08,282
Now take that helmet off and let's go.,S01E08,283
What did you do to your head?,S01E08,284
Gave myself a haircut.,S01E08,285
You like it?,S01E08,286
I want it documented that that happened before I got here.,S01E08,287
"Wait wait wait wait, no, hey hey.",S01E08,288
"All right, time out.",S01E08,289
Dr. Singh?,S01E08,290
"Oh, it's about time. I--",S01E08,291
Wait a minute.,S01E08,292
I ordered Batman.,S01E08,293
Not Frankenstein and Goldilocks?,S01E08,294
Close enough.,S01E08,295
"No, we're not here for the party.",S01E08,296
You delivered me.,S01E08,297
I think I would have remembered that.,S01E08,298
"I'm Teddy, Amy Duncan's daughter. She's about to give birth",S01E08,299
- And needs you at the hospital.,S01E08,300
- I can't leave.,S01E08,301
I have to stay here and enjoy my son's birthday.,S01E08,302
"Who threw that? Was it you, Tyler?",S01E08,303
Or the other Tyler?,S01E08,304
No no no no no.,S01E08,305
No no no.,S01E08,306
"How about we make a deal, okay?",S01E08,307
"If you go to the hospital and take care of my mom,",S01E08,308
Then we'll stay here and entertain the kids.,S01E08,309
And how are we gonna do that?,S01E08,310
We'll do my play for them.,S01E08,311
"Oh, it's a delightful fable about people from different worlds",S01E08,312
Who overcome their differences and become friends.,S01E08,313
I give it two thumbs up.,S01E08,314
Good luck.,S01E08,315
"Hey, kids, who wants to see a play, huh?",S01E08,316
That is a yes from Tyler.,S01E08,317
Hey!,S01E08,318
"If Gretel gets hit with a football,",S01E08,319
There's gonna be one less Tyler at this party.,S01E08,320
This should be good.,S01E08,321
We just drove 40 miles behind a truck,S01E08,322
Loaded with live chickens on motorcycles.,S01E08,323
The chickens weren't on motorcycles.,S01E08,324
We were.,S01E08,325
- You must be the Duncans. - How'd you know that?,S01E08,326
Wild guess.,S01E08,327
In there.,S01E08,328
"Oh, uh, thanks for dropping us off.",S01E08,329
We can handle it from here.,S01E08,330
"Oh, we can't leave now.",S01E08,331
We're emotionally invested.,S01E08,332
And I need to grab a quick shower.,S01E08,333
She's not kidding.,S01E08,334
I can't believe you threw up in my car.,S01E08,335
What did you expect?,S01E08,336
For lunch I ate two cans of frosting.,S01E08,337
We're looking for Amy Duncan.,S01E08,338
We know the Duncans.,S01E08,339
Good enough for me.,S01E08,340
- I like your hair.,S01E08,341
- Thanks.,S01E08,342
I like your scar.,S01E08,343
"Hello, is anyone home in this gingerbread house?",S01E08,344
Frankenstein?,S01E08,345
What are you doing in German Switzerland?,S01E08,346
Me want friend.,S01E08,347
But how can a big monster like you,S01E08,348
Be friends with a sweet little peasant girl like me?,S01E08,349
It's possible. If you believe,S01E08,350
"We can be friends, clap hands.",S01E08,351
Clap hands!,S01E08,352
Like this!,S01E08,353
"T, give it up.",S01E08,354
What are you doing? Stick to the script.,S01E08,355
Look at them.,S01E08,356
They're bored silly.,S01E08,357
Let's just stop.,S01E08,358
"No, we can't.",S01E08,359
Frankenstein hasn't found the courage to cry yet.,S01E08,360
"Sorry, Frankie, Gretel's taking over.",S01E08,361
"Hey, kids, who wants to play pin the tail on the Frankenstein?",S01E08,362
Me me me!,S01E08,363
That's a picture of our son Hog.,S01E08,364
His name's Hog?,S01E08,365
It was.,S01E08,366
He changed it to Kevin.,S01E08,367
The boy's been a real disappointment.,S01E08,368
- Is he like a criminal or something? - Worse.,S01E08,369
Vice president of marketing.,S01E08,370
"- First baby? - That obvious, huh?",S01E08,371
"Hey, I've been there.",S01E08,372
- You have? - Oh yeah.,S01E08,373
- This is my third time sitting in these chairs.,S01E08,374
- Wow.,S01E08,375
"If you don't mind my asking,",S01E08,376
- How old were you the first time? - Two.,S01E08,377
- Has mom given birth yet? - Nope.,S01E08,378
"- Hey, Teddy. - What happened to your hair?",S01E08,379
I'm conditioning.,S01E08,380
You're Teddy?,S01E08,381
You're exactly like Gabe described you.,S01E08,382
"Hey, kids, come on.",S01E08,383
There's somebody I want you to meet.,S01E08,384
Hi.,S01E08,385
"Come in, come in.",S01E08,386
"Say hello to your new baby sister, everybody.",S01E08,387
"Her name is Charlotte. Do you want to hold her, Teddy?",S01E08,388
- Can I? - Of course.,S01E08,389
She's beautiful.,S01E08,390
Hi there.,S01E08,391
Nice to meet you.,S01E08,392
And I don't usually look like this.,S01E08,393
I can't believe I have a baby sister.,S01E08,394
Would you mind taking a picture?,S01E08,395
Thank you.,S01E08,396
- What's the baby's name? - Charlotte.,S01E08,397
"- Mama, can we call her Charlie? - Charlie!",S01E08,398
"Oh, I love it.",S01E08,399
Quite a family you got there.,S01E08,400
"Good luck, Charlie.",S01E08,401
"Sweetie, I just love this present.",S01E08,402
"Oh, thanks, mom.",S01E08,403
"But to be fair, P.",S01E08,404
J.,S01E08,405
And Gabe set the bar pretty low.,S01E08,406
- What?! - Hey.,S01E08,407
Surprise.,S01E08,408
"Oh, mad dog, Francis,",S01E08,409
Come on in.,S01E08,410
What are you guys doing here?,S01E08,411
We have a birthday present for our goddaughter.,S01E08,412
A baby biker vest.,S01E08,413
Let's try it on.,S01E08,414
That's so cute.,S01E08,415
I love it.,S01E08,416
Did you ask them to be the godparents?,S01E08,417
Of course not.,S01E08,418
Then you have to tell them that they are not the godparents.,S01E08,419
No thank you.,S01E08,420
"Fine, I'll do it.",S01E08,421
Excuse me.,S01E08,422
There's something I have to tell you.,S01E08,423
"Oh, welcome to the family.",S01E08,424
"Guys, check it out.",S01E08,425
- Ohhh! - Cutie.,S01E08,426
I know I heard something.,S01E08,427
I think it's coming from the kitchen.,S01E08,428
"Okay, you wait here.",S01E08,429
Or I could hide upstairs.,S01E08,430
"You're here for the egg salad, aren't you?",S01E08,431
"Okay, sit down.",S01E08,432
You bring back my truck?,S01E08,433
Full tank of gas?,S01E08,434
"What, were you raised in a cave?",S01E08,435
"Hey, Charlie! It's your big sister Teddy",S01E09,0
with the latest installment of my video diary.,S01E09,1
"Teddy, turn that thing off.",S01E09,2
It's breakfast time.,S01E09,3
In a minute!,S01E09,4
That noise you hear is our neighbor's annoying new dog.,S01E09,5
"Ever since she got that little rat,",S01E09,6
none of us have gotten any sleep.,S01E09,7
"Teddy, I asked you to do something.",S01E09,8
And I asked for a minute!,S01E09,9
Your breakfast is getting cold.,S01E09,10
"Well, then just put it back in the toaster!",S01E09,11
Sorry you had to see that.,S01E09,12
There is no prize in here.,S01E09,13
There's supposed to be a prize.,S01E09,14
You took it out yesterday.,S01E09,15
"I know, but I put it back in",S01E09,16
so I'd have something to look forward to.,S01E09,17
"Bob, where are you?",S01E09,18
Can I have a minute?!,S01E09,19
"Well, hurry up!",S01E09,20
You're missing quality family time!,S01E09,21
"Gabe, stop hitting the toaster.",S01E09,22
But it's taking forever.,S01E09,23
I don't even remember what I put in here.,S01E09,24
"Okay, Charlie, I will get you your juice in just a minute, honey.",S01E09,25
Whoa! Even Charlie's in a mood.,S01E09,26
Morning.,S01E09,27
"Bob, did you forget to do something?",S01E09,28
I'll kiss you tonight.,S01E09,29
No.,S01E09,30
You only shaved half your face.,S01E09,31
"Pick, pick, pick.",S01E09,32
Maybe this is how I like to wear it now.,S01E09,33
"Well, it looks ridiculous.",S01E09,34
What if I decided just to brush half my hair?,S01E09,35
I thought you already made that decision.,S01E09,36
"Oh, you are going down!",S01E09,37
Wait! Stop! Stop! Do you guys hear that?,S01E09,38
I don't hear anything.,S01E09,39
Exactly.,S01E09,40
The barking stopped.,S01E09,41
"- Oh, come on!  - Really?",S01E09,42
Today's all burnt toast{\i0},S01E09,43
"Running late, and dad jokes{\i0}",S01E09,44
Has anybody seen my left shoe{\i0},S01E09,45
"I close my eyes, take a bite{\i0}",S01E09,46
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud{\i0}",S01E09,47
There it is up on the roof{\i0},S01E09,48
"I've been there, I've survived{\i0}",S01E09,49
So just take my advice{\i0},S01E09,50
"Hang in there, baby,{\i0}",S01E09,51
Things are crazy{\i0},S01E09,52
But I know your future is bright{\i0},S01E09,53
"Hang in there, Baby{\i0}",S01E09,54
There is no maybe{\i0},S01E09,55
Eveything turns out all right{\i0},S01E09,56
Sure life is up and down{\i0},S01E09,57
"But trust me, it comes back all around{\i0}",S01E09,58
You're gonna love who you turn out to be{\i0},S01E09,59
"Hang in there, Baby{\i0}",S01E09,60
"Well, at least Charlie's getting some sleep.",S01E09,61
"Why did Mrs. Dabney have to get that stupid dog, anyway?",S01E09,62
Why couldn't she get something that made less noise,S01E09,63
Like a fish?,S01E09,64
Fish don't make any noise.,S01E09,65
I wish you were a fish.,S01E09,66
Can we all agree that thing is a pest?,S01E09,67
"Because as an exterminator, it is my job",S01E09,68
To take care of pests.,S01E09,69
"When you say take care of,",S01E09,70
I know you actually mean kill.,S01E09,71
"Which I'm totally fine with, by the way.",S01E09,72
I'll just go over to Mrs. Dabney's and demand,S01E09,73
She keep the dog in at night.,S01E09,74
Or we could just try being friendly.,S01E09,75
Friendly? With Mrs. Dabney?,S01E09,76
"What is this, crazy idea day?",S01E09,77
"Okay, look, I am serious.",S01E09,78
How about I invite her over tonight,S01E09,79
for a cup of coffee and I bake a pie?,S01E09,80
I thought you wanted this to go well.,S01E09,81
"Okay, we'll have Mrs. Dabney over,",S01E09,82
"but I want everybody on their best behavior,",S01E09,83
"especially you, mister.",S01E09,84
I don't think I have a best behavior.,S01E09,85
"Yeah, well, you'd better find one before tonight.",S01E09,86
"In her defense, Mrs.",S01E09,87
Dabney wasn't always like this.,S01E09,88
She actually used to be kind of nice.,S01E09,89
When was that?,S01E09,90
"Let's see, how old are you?",S01E09,91
"All right, got my pie.",S01E09,92
What do you want?,S01E09,93
"We don't want anything, Mrs.",S01E09,94
Dabney.,S01E09,95
"Yeah, we're just being neighborly.",S01E09,96
What did he do?,S01E09,97
I didn't do anything.,S01E09,98
"I don't like you, Gabe.",S01E09,99
"But I like you, Mrs.",S01E09,100
Dabney.,S01E09,101
"In fact, I'd like to take care of you.",S01E09,102
Out.,S01E09,103
"Mrs. Dabney, so you have a new dog",S01E09,104
A little chihuahua.,S01E09,105
So that's what this is about.,S01E09,106
It's not not what this is about.,S01E09,107
Dog's got a name Hercules.,S01E09,108
That's funny because,S01E09,109
Hercules is like so big and strong,S01E09,110
And your dog is so,S01E09,111
Just being neighborly.,S01E09,112
"Look, the thing is, Hercules has a tendency to bark",S01E09,113
A lot,S01E09,114
All night long.,S01E09,115
"Right, so we were wondering if maybe",S01E09,116
you could bring him in before bedtime.,S01E09,117
"Oh, no! Fresh air's good for dogs.",S01E09,118
"Well, sleep is good for people.",S01E09,119
I had that same thought,S01E09,120
After every one of your many babies arrived.,S01E09,121
We were talking about the dog.,S01E09,122
"Well, since we're airing our grievances",S01E09,123
We begged her not to make that pie.,S01E09,124
I was gonna say that maybe there's a little something,S01E09,125
You can do for me.,S01E09,126
"Oh, Mrs. Dabney, we've already told you,",S01E09,127
We're not sending Gabe to military school.,S01E09,128
"But if it's a deal-breaker, we are willing to send him",S01E09,129
To other places.,S01E09,130
I was talking about your oak tree out back.,S01E09,131
There's a branch that hangs over my yard,S01E09,132
Always dropping acorns and making a big mess.,S01E09,133
"Well, no problem.",S01E09,134
"Dog goes in, branch comes off.",S01E09,135
We got a deal?,S01E09,136
We have a deal.,S01E09,137
"Dad, that branch holds our treehouse.",S01E09,138
"Well, so what? You kids haven't been up there in years.",S01E09,139
I'm confused. Is Gabe going somewhere or not?,S01E09,140
"You know, if that treehouse comes down,",S01E09,141
That'll be even better More sunlight for my vegetable garden.,S01E09,142
Start eating healthier Might even make my goal,S01E09,143
Of living to be 100.,S01E09,144
"Mrs. Dabney, don't you want to stay and finish your pie?",S01E09,145
"You have a good night, now.",S01E09,146
She's gone? But I didn't get my hug.,S01E09,147
"Well, at least we'll finally be able to get some sleep.",S01E09,148
Too bad we have to lose our treehouse.,S01E09,149
We have a treehouse?,S01E09,150
Yeah.,S01E09,151
Teddy and I used to go up there all the time when we were little.,S01E09,152
"Yeah, we had so much fun up there.",S01E09,153
Are you kidding me?,S01E09,154
All you two ever did up there was fight.,S01E09,155
That's not how I remember it.,S01E09,156
We had great times.,S01E09,157
"Yeah, I mean, except for, you know, all those times",S01E09,158
That you fell out the window.,S01E09,159
"Oh, I enjoyed those too.",S01E09,160
How did I not know we had a treehouse?,S01E09,161
"Well, cause it's kind of overgrown.",S01E09,162
I built it that summer we went to Hawaii.,S01E09,163
You guys went to Hawaii?!,S01E09,164
Yeah.,S01E09,165
We used to do all kinds of fun stuff.,S01E09,166
When did that stop?,S01E09,167
"Well, how old are you?",S01E09,168
"Check it out, Charlie.",S01E09,169
Here's our old treehouse.,S01E09,170
"Oh, look. Here's your old tea party set",S01E09,171
And all our board games.,S01E09,172
Oh! Wait And look at this.,S01E09,173
These are the Chinese handcuffs,S01E09,174
That pj always used to get stuck in.,S01E09,175
Uh A little help?,S01E09,176
Oh! Baby booboo!,S01E09,177
"Oh my goodness, I thought I lost her.",S01E09,178
It's been so many years.,S01E09,179
And those years have not been kind.,S01E09,180
"Yeah, I remember. I used to come up here",S01E09,181
And pretend booboo was a real baby.,S01E09,182
"I was a very good mother, huh?",S01E09,183
Until you left your baby in a treehouse for 10 years.,S01E09,184
"Oh, whoa, look!",S01E09,185
Here's something you carved into the wall.,S01E09,186
P.,S01E09,187
J.,S01E09,188
hearts P.,S01E09,189
B.,S01E09,190
Who's P.,S01E09,191
B.,S01E09,192
?.,S01E09,193
Peanut butter.,S01E09,194
It was a simpler time.,S01E09,195
You know what stinks?,S01E09,196
When they premix it with the jelly.,S01E09,197
"No, it stinks that Charlie's never gonna",S01E09,198
get to use this treehouse.,S01E09,199
She'd probably love it up here.,S01E09,200
"Hey, kids! Come on down now!",S01E09,201
P.,S01E09,202
J.,S01E09,203
", we have to save this place for Charlie.",S01E09,204
"Well, I wish we could, but Dad made a deal.",S01E09,205
"Yeah well, deals are made to be broken.",S01E09,206
Right!,S01E09,207
The golden rule!,S01E09,208
"- Hey, kids!  - Hey, Dad!",S01E09,209
We changed our minds.,S01E09,210
We don't want to lose the treehouse after all.,S01E09,211
It's too late.,S01E09,212
I already shook hands on it.,S01E09,213
"Well, can we at least talk about this?",S01E09,214
"Yeah, maybe take a family vote?",S01E09,215
"This isn't a democracy, guys.",S01E09,216
"And by the way, even if it was,",S01E09,217
The guy with the chainsaw,S01E09,218
Always wins.,S01E09,219
Come on.,S01E09,220
Come on down.,S01E09,221
No!,S01E09,222
No?,S01E09,223
"No, we're not leaving.",S01E09,224
Yeah! We're staying right here.,S01E09,225
We're fighting the power!,S01E09,226
Get down here now or you're grounded!,S01E09,227
You can't ground someone who's not actually on the ground.,S01E09,228
"Yeah! Right on, P.",S01E09,229
J.,S01E09,230
Fight the power!.,S01E09,231
You know what?,S01E09,232
Good luck fighting the power saw!,S01E09,233
You're coming down one way or another!,S01E09,234
"No, we are not, okay? We have history on our side!",S01E09,235
We are going to protest peacefully,S01E09,236
Like gandhi and martin luther king.,S01E09,237
He had a dream.,S01E09,238
"Yeah well, I got a dream too, Teddy",S01E09,239
To get some sleep!,S01E09,240
You're not scaring us.,S01E09,241
No! We laugh at you!,S01E09,242
"All right, you know what?",S01E09,243
I'm done messing around.,S01E09,244
I'm bringing out the big guns.,S01E09,245
That's right Mom!,S01E09,246
You go get Mom.,S01E09,247
"Yeah, she doesn't scare us!",S01E09,248
"This is bad, he's getting Mom.",S01E09,249
Lock her up.,S01E09,250
Go out there and get your kids out of that tree.,S01E09,251
"Okay, why are they always my kids",S01E09,252
when they won't do what you want?,S01E09,253
They're having some kind of sit-in,S01E09,254
to try and save the treehouse.,S01E09,255
"Now, I appreciate that they're taking a stand.",S01E09,256
I just don't like that it's against me!,S01E09,257
Would you calm down?,S01E09,258
But I'm the father!,S01E09,259
I'm in charge around here!,S01E09,260
When you're not home.,S01E09,261
"Honey, you are getting upset over nothing.",S01E09,262
This is Teddy and P.,S01E09,263
J.,S01E09,264
We're talking about.,S01E09,265
They can't be in the same room for five minutes,S01E09,266
Without getting into a fight.,S01E09,267
They won't last an hour up there.,S01E09,268
All right.,S01E09,269
"But when they come down, they're getting punished for defying me!",S01E09,270
If that's okay with you.,S01E09,271
I'm tired.,S01E09,272
I'm cold.,S01E09,273
How much longer can we keep this up?,S01E09,274
We've been up here for 12 minutes.,S01E09,275
"If I had known we were gonna protest,",S01E09,276
I would have prepared.,S01E09,277
"For one thing, I wouldn't have had",S01E09,278
That extra-large root beer.,S01E09,279
"All right, let's just stay focused on why we're here",S01E09,280
For Charlie.,S01E09,281
That doesn't help.,S01E09,282
Charlie gets to pee whenever she wants,S01E09,283
"- Which is why my idea - Okay, please don't tell me",S01E09,284
About diaper-for-teens again.,S01E09,285
"Hey, Gabe.",S01E09,286
Hey.,S01E09,287
"So, this is the famous treehouse I never knew about.",S01E09,288
Want to join our sit-in?,S01E09,289
It's just like when Gandhi and Billie Jean King,S01E09,290
teamed up to stop the civil war.,S01E09,291
Almost every word in that sentence was wrong.,S01E09,292
"What do you say, Gabe? Are you in?",S01E09,293
I'm in.,S01E09,294
- Great.  - Yeah!,S01E09,295
"But first, you'll need to bring us some supplies,",S01E09,296
Just the essentials.,S01E09,297
"Snacks, my video games, my guitar",S01E09,298
"Whoa, dude, this is a sit-in,",S01E09,299
Not a move-in.,S01E09,300
Oh! And some peanut butter.,S01E09,301
"Yeah, that's right, the love affair continues.",S01E09,302
"Well, I'll be back.",S01E09,303
What are you doing?,S01E09,304
I'm gonna join the sit-in.,S01E09,305
I have to do what's right.,S01E09,306
How about I take you out for ice cream instead?,S01E09,307
I'll be in the car.,S01E09,308
What was that crazy card game,S01E09,309
We used to play with all the eights?,S01E09,310
Crazy eights.,S01E09,311
No,S01E09,312
Where is Gabe with the snacks?,S01E09,313
Now I'm getting hungry.,S01E09,314
So hungry.,S01E09,315
I keep thinking I smell steak cooking.,S01E09,316
"Yeah, me too.",S01E09,317
Really?,S01E09,318
"Oh, hey!",S01E09,319
Don't mind me Just making dinner for my family,S01E09,320
"You know, the ones on the ground.",S01E09,321
"Yeah, okay. We know what you're doing",S01E09,322
And it's not gonna work.,S01E09,323
"Well, suit yourself.",S01E09,324
But I'm making one medium rare,S01E09,325
The way I know someone likes.,S01E09,326
I like medium rare.,S01E09,327
He's talking about me.,S01E09,328
Stay strong.,S01E09,329
"Now, I'm gonna be right back.",S01E09,330
I'm going inside the house,S01E09,331
To check on my chocolate souffle.,S01E09,332
Two can play at this game!,S01E09,333
"Yeah, if we had a barbecue and some steaks.",S01E09,334
Catch of the day T-Bone.,S01E09,335
Yes!,S01E09,336
"- Okay.  - No, no, no!",S01E09,337
You'll never get the T-Bone.,S01E09,338
Go for the filet.,S01E09,339
I think I got it. I got it! I got it!,S01E09,340
I have never loved you more than,S01E09,341
Idiot!,S01E09,342
I think somebody overcooked their fishing pole.,S01E09,343
This looks more medium well.,S01E09,344
I'm so hungry!,S01E09,345
And there's nothing to eat up here.,S01E09,346
"Or is there? Acorns Acorns are food, right?",S01E09,347
For squirrels.,S01E09,348
How do squirrels do this.,S01E09,349
"Well, they're squirrels.",S01E09,350
You know what?,S01E09,351
I can't take this anymore.,S01E09,352
I'm done.,S01E09,353
"Wait, no!",S01E09,354
You're just giving up? That is so like you!,S01E09,355
What is so like me?,S01E09,356
To be a quitter.,S01E09,357
"Yeah? Well, you're bossy!",S01E09,358
I am not bossy!,S01E09,359
And don't you ever call me that again. I forbid you!,S01E09,360
- Bossy!  - Quitty!,S01E09,361
"Oh, real mature!",S01E09,362
I am more mature than you are!,S01E09,363
Whatever! Oh! Okay!,S01E09,364
Okay!,S01E09,365
"All right, drop the bat",S01E09,366
Or baby booboo becomes baby barbecue.,S01E09,367
You wouldn't dare!,S01E09,368
Try me.,S01E09,369
Give me the baby.,S01E09,370
Give me the bat.,S01E09,371
The baby.,S01E09,372
The bat,S01E09,373
P.,S01E09,374
J.,S01E09,375
!.,S01E09,376
Pull me up! Pull me up!,S01E09,377
"Oh, wait! Are you quitting?",S01E09,378
What?,S01E09,379
"You know, like,",S01E09,380
"If I pull you back in, will you keep doing the sit-in?",S01E09,381
Since my alternative is a face-first dive,S01E09,382
into a hot barbecue Yes!,S01E09,383
One more thing.,S01E09,384
You have to drive me wherever I want to go,S01E09,385
For the next month.,S01E09,386
Deal.,S01E09,387
"Now pull me up,my face is browning.",S01E09,388
Okay.,S01E09,389
Thank you for saving me.,S01E09,390
No problem.,S01E09,391
"Although, you wouldn't have had to save me",S01E09,392
If you didn't push me out of a treehouse!,S01E09,393
Whoa whoa whoa! Hey hey! Stop!,S01E09,394
Whoa! Truce! Truce!,S01E09,395
"Gosh, what is wrong with us? We're going at it like seven-year-olds.",S01E09,396
Mom was right.,S01E09,397
"We did fight up here all the time, didn't we?",S01E09,398
"Yes, and nothing's changed.",S01E09,399
We're still doing it.,S01E09,400
Is this the way it's always gonna be between us?,S01E09,401
I hope not.,S01E09,402
I don't want to be sitting on the porch,S01E09,403
Of our old folks' home whacking each other,S01E09,404
With foam bats.,S01E09,405
"Oh, do we have to live in the same old folks' home?",S01E09,406
P.,S01E09,407
J.,S01E09,408
", if we can't come together.",S01E09,409
"And do this one thing for Charlie,",S01E09,410
We're never gonna come together on anything.,S01E09,411
You're right.,S01E09,412
We can do this For Charlie.,S01E09,413
For Charlie.,S01E09,414
So,S01E09,415
What do you want to do now?,S01E09,416
I don't know.,S01E09,417
I wish we could hurry up and save this treehouse,S01E09,418
So we could get the heck out of this treehouse.,S01E09,419
They're still up in that tree.,S01E09,420
You said they'd be down by now.,S01E09,421
"Well, I thought they would be.",S01E09,422
Why is there a plastic hook in my steak?,S01E09,423
Eat around it.,S01E09,424
"You know, when you think about it,",S01E09,425
This is actually kind of nice.,S01E09,426
"I mean, Teddy and P.",S01E09,427
J.,S01E09,428
Are finally working together on something.,S01E09,429
I'm proud of them.,S01E09,430
"Whose side are you on,",S01E09,431
Ours or the rebels?,S01E09,432
The rebels?,S01E09,433
"Okay, you realize",S01E09,434
"We're not actually at war, right?",S01E09,435
Of course I do.,S01E09,436
"For that to happen, someone would have to issue",S01E09,437
A formal declaration of war,S01E09,438
Which should almost be done printing out.,S01E09,439
"Bob, they're doing exactly what we taught them to do.",S01E09,440
They're standing up for what they believe in.,S01E09,441
"Well, you know what? Now we're going to teach them",S01E09,442
Don't mess with Daddy.,S01E09,443
"Gabe, go get your water balloon launcher.",S01E09,444
Okay.,S01E09,445
"Gabe, sit.",S01E09,446
"Bob, you're taking this too far.",S01E09,447
No I'm not.,S01E09,448
"And I gave you an order, mister.",S01E09,449
"Gabe, stand down.",S01E09,450
"Sorry, Dad, but I'm a little more afraid of Mom.",S01E09,451
Fine.,S01E09,452
I'll fight this battle myself.,S01E09,453
"Hey, sweetheart, you're not really afraid of me, are you?",S01E09,454
A little.,S01E09,455
Good.,S01E09,456
I'm giving you one last chance to come down!,S01E09,457
Okay! All right!,S01E09,458
"I don't like doing this, but you've forced my hand!",S01E09,459
"Oh, come on! So lucky!",S01E09,460
You got so lucky! You know what?,S01E09,461
Next one's coming right through the window!,S01E09,462
"Oh, yeah? Take that!",S01E09,463
What are you doing?,S01E09,464
Fightin' the power!,S01E09,465
But we're the power.,S01E09,466
The kids are right.,S01E09,467
This treehouse is worth saving.,S01E09,468
What is going on over here?,S01E09,469
"You know, this really isn't a good time, Mrs.",S01E09,470
Dabney.,S01E09,471
You'd better get a handle on that family of yours,S01E09,472
"'Cause right now, it looks like they're kicking your butt.",S01E09,473
"Would you let me deal with this, please?",S01E09,474
"You'd better, cause hercules is getting kinda lonely.",S01E09,475
I'm thinking of getting another dog.,S01E09,476
Are you threatening me?,S01E09,477
This one's gonna be female,S01E09,478
Might even have some puppies.,S01E09,479
That's right.,S01E09,480
You go get them down.,S01E09,481
Time to put on the big pants!,S01E09,482
He's coming up.,S01E09,483
We have to stop him.,S01E09,484
Hold your fire!,S01E09,485
"Careful,",S01E09,486
This could be a trick.,S01E09,487
I come in peace.,S01E09,488
I've come to join the resistance.,S01E09,489
All right! Yeah!,S01E09,490
"That's right, Mrs. Dabney!",S01E09,491
I don't care about your dog!,S01E09,492
"Oh, the big pants are on",S01E09,493
And they're staying up here with my family.,S01E09,494
We did it! Yes!,S01E09,495
"You can have a treehouse, Charlie.",S01E09,496
For a long long time.,S01E09,497
What was that?,S01E09,498
"Wait, have we ever all been up here at the same time?",S01E09,499
Is everyone okay?,S01E09,500
- Yeah - I think so.,S01E09,501
"Whoa, look!",S01E09,502
"Oh, hon!",S01E09,503
Was that so hard?,S01E09,504
Yeah.,S01E09,505
"Well, the treehouse is down.",S01E09,506
"So, you're gonna be bringing your dog in tonight, right?",S01E09,507
"Oh, hercules doesn't belong to me.",S01E09,508
I was just dogsitting for a couple of days.,S01E09,509
I'm a cat person,S01E09,510
And an excellent negotiator.,S01E09,511
Do not throw that balloon.,S01E09,512

"Right now, she's baby tennis ball. Yeah!",S01E09,519
"No, not as much fun.",S01E09,520
"Oh, and I want to recommend that you make the treehouse",S01E09,521
No boys allowed,S01E09,522
"Especially if that boy weighs as much as Dad,",S01E09,523
"because if you do let him up there,",S01E09,524
"well, good luck, Charlie.",S01E09,525
What are you doing?,S01E09,526
Gabe says he's more scared of Mom than he is of me.,S01E09,527
So I'm going to scare him.,S01E09,528
"Hey, Dad!",S01E09,529
"Gabe, honey, did you finish your homework?",S01E09,530
Ah Mummy mom.,S01E09,531

I forgot to tell you something.,S01E10,21
It's about your Uncle Mel he called.,S01E10,22
I don't wanna hear it.,S01E10,23
"Oh, come on! He begged me to pass on the message.",S01E10,24
"Thank you, and now I'm going to pass on the message.",S01E10,25
Who's Uncle Mel?,S01E10,26
Somebody you'll never know.,S01E10,27
He's your father's uncle.,S01E10,28
"Okay, so you told me about Uncle Stanley",S01E10,29
"Who knits sweaters for his cats,",S01E10,30
But you didn't want to tell me about Uncle Mel?,S01E10,31
"Because, Teddy, if you don't have",S01E10,32
"Anything nice to say about someone,",S01E10,33
Then don't say anything at all.,S01E10,34
And Mel's an idiot.,S01E10,35
"Okay, mom, tell me about Uncle Mel.",S01E10,36
"Well, he and your father had",S01E10,37
Some kind of falling out.,S01E10,38
That's all I know.,S01E10,39
Isn't there some way we can find out more?,S01E10,40
This is the first interesting thing about dad since,S01E10,41
"Well, this is the first interesting thing about dad.",S01E10,42

"Well, finally. What happened?",S01E10,70
We were in the park and this photographer,S01E10,71
Thought that Charlie was the cutest baby ever.,S01E10,72
He offered to pay her 100 dollars to use her as a model.,S01E10,73
Who knew? She's actually good for something,S01E10,74
Besides drooling and pooping.,S01E10,75
Walter Louper photography.,S01E10,76
"Specializing in dogs, cats and babies.",S01E10,77
Forget it.,S01E10,78
I'm not exploiting my baby.,S01E10,79
But we don't have a dog or a cat.,S01E10,80
"Mom, come on.",S01E10,81
This could be a big break for Charlie.,S01E10,82
P.,S01E10,83
J.,S01E10,84
", Charlie is not getting a job before you do.",S01E10,85
"Well, the photographer didn't offer to shoot me.",S01E10,86
Ha.,S01E10,87
You don't have to have a modeling job.,S01E10,88
Any job will do.,S01E10,89
Come here.,S01E10,90
"Man, this conversation sure took an ugly turn.",S01E10,91
"Anyway, we will not be needing this.",S01E10,92
I knew we should've done it my way.,S01E10,93
What was your way?,S01E10,94
"We don't tell mom we're doing the photo shoot,",S01E10,95
We go ahead and do it anyway and split the money.,S01E10,96
When did you come up with that?,S01E10,97
At the park.,S01E10,98
I told you when The girls' cross-country team ran by.,S01E10,99
"Oh, yeah!",S01E10,100
What were we talking about again?,S01E10,101
"Hi, Charlie.",S01E10,102
Teddy here.,S01E10,103
So it turns out there's a Duncan family mystery.,S01E10,104
"Yeah, yesterday I found out we have an Uncle Mel.",S01E10,105
Does this look good on me?,S01E10,106
"Well, only if you pull your pants over your face,",S01E10,107
because that is a belt.,S01E10,108
We need to go to the mall today.,S01E10,109
You don't have anything new for me to wear.,S01E10,110
"Okay, Ivy, I'm thinking about something",S01E10,111
a little bit more important than clothes.,S01E10,112
Shoes?,S01E10,113
Family.,S01E10,114
"You're funny, T.",S01E10,115
"Okay, listen. Something went down between my dad and his Uncle Mel",S01E10,116
And I have to know what happened.,S01E10,117
What is this?,S01E10,118
"Oh, that's a credit card my dad gave me a while ago.",S01E10,119
And I'm just now hearing about this?,S01E10,120
"Well, it's for emergencies only.",S01E10,121
"Honey, I've seen your closet.",S01E10,122
It is an emergency.,S01E10,123
"Okay. Well, if you go to the rest home with me,",S01E10,124
I will go to the mall with you.,S01E10,125
"Okay, but I have to warn you:",S01E10,126
My grandpa was in a rest home,S01E10,127
And it was depressing. He'd just sit there,S01E10,128
And complain about how nobody ever came to visit.,S01E10,129
"Finally, I just stopped going.",S01E10,130
We have several options at Shady Hills:,S01E10,131
"There's the one-year plan, the three-year plan and the fi",S01E10,132

Weirder than hedy?,S01E10,164
This is my niece Teddy,S01E10,165
And do you like music?,S01E10,166
I love music.,S01E10,167

And welcome to,S01E10,173
The room that we're in.,S01E10,174
We're gonna start off with a little,S01E10,175
Maestro?,S01E10,176
I think I remember Swanee River.,S01E10,177
Swanee River.,S01E10,178
Way down upon the Swanee River,S01E10,179
far far away,S01E10,180
I don't remember the words.,S01E10,181
I only know the dirty ones from third grade.,S01E10,182
It's such a funny name for a river,S01E10,183
"And that's all I have to say, hey.",S01E10,184
"Okay, that's enough of that.",S01E10,185
Let's try something else.,S01E10,186
Any requests?,S01E10,187
Swanee River.,S01E10,188
"Oh, boy.",S01E10,189
It's almost ready to go.,S01E10,190
"You've got a real cute baby there,",S01E10,191
One of the best I've ever seen.,S01E10,192
"Yeah yeah, did you bring the cash?",S01E10,193
"I did, but first I need a parent to sign this release form.",S01E10,194
No problemo.,S01E10,195
Problemo.,S01E10,196
Sure.,S01E10,197
Mom is right in the kitchen.,S01E10,198
She is?,S01E10,199
She is.,S01E10,200
"Gabe, why don't you go into the kitchen",S01E10,201
And have mom sign this for us?,S01E10,202
"So you're a photographer, huh?",S01E10,203
Yup.,S01E10,204
"Oh, I got a camera for my seventh birthday",S01E10,205
Then I lost it.,S01E10,206
Cute story.,S01E10,207
"Well, here you go.",S01E10,208
Your mom has very nice Printing.,S01E10,209
"You know, before we start the session",S01E10,210
I probably better go talk to her.,S01E10,211
Very bad idea.,S01E10,212
And why is that?,S01E10,213
Because she's in one of her moods,S01E10,214
And now she wants more money.,S01E10,215
She does? How much?,S01E10,216
125 dollars.,S01E10,217
What?,S01E10,218
But we agreed on 100 dollars.,S01E10,219
"Walter, I've been riding",S01E10,220
this rollercoaster for the past 17 years.,S01E10,221
Let me handle it.,S01E10,222
This is a strange situation.,S01E10,223
The moms almost always want to meet me.,S01E10,224
This one just wants her money.,S01E10,225
Pack it up.,S01E10,226
The show's over.,S01E10,227
What? What happened?,S01E10,228
She wants you out.,S01E10,229
You don't understand.,S01E10,230
I have a deadline to meet.,S01E10,231
We have to make this work.,S01E10,232
"Well, you might want to offer her 150 dollars.",S01E10,233
Fine.,S01E10,234
"150 dollars, but that's it.",S01E10,235
Let me see what I can do.,S01E10,236
Let's make some magic.,S01E10,237
And my baby sister's name is Charlie.,S01E10,238
"Charlie, Teddy",S01E10,239
Didn't your dad know any girl names?,S01E10,240
"Speaking of my dad,",S01E10,241
What exactly happened between you guys?,S01E10,242
You don't want to hear about that.,S01E10,243
"Actually, I do.",S01E10,244
"Well, look. We just met",S01E10,245
And I'd like to get to know someone,S01E10,246
Before I start saying bad things about their father.,S01E10,247
Okay.,S01E10,248
"Well, let's get to know each other.",S01E10,249
Tell me about yourself.,S01E10,250

"Hey, there's a game today. Will you take me?",S01E10,252
Tell me other things about yourself.,S01E10,253
"Oh, come on.",S01E10,254
I haven't been to a ballgame in forever.,S01E10,255
I'd give anything to go to one.,S01E10,256
"Well, today?",S01E10,257
I don't know. I promised my friend,S01E10,258
"yeah yeah, fine, thanks.",S01E10,259
Thanks for dropping by.,S01E10,260
See you in 20 years.,S01E10,261
I'll be sitting right here.,S01E10,262
T.,S01E10,263
You've got to try this.,S01E10,264
What is it?,S01E10,265
Steak and potatoes.,S01E10,266
They can blend anything in this place.,S01E10,267
"Okay, Ivy.",S01E10,268
Hey.,S01E10,269
What would you say to a little change in plans?,S01E10,270
Am I gonna like this change?,S01E10,271
It involves us getting out of here.,S01E10,272
I'm in.,S01E10,273
We're going to a ballgame.,S01E10,274
I'm out.,S01E10,275
"Fine, then stay here.",S01E10,276
Back in.,S01E10,277
"Mel, come on, let's go.",S01E10,278
We're going to the ballgame.,S01E10,279
"Hot dog! Sounds great,",S01E10,280
But first we've got to get past the warden.,S01E10,281
I'll handle her.,S01E10,282
Excuse me.,S01E10,283
I'd like to take Mel out for the afternoon.,S01E10,284

Hot stuff coming through.,S01E10,308
"Ivy! Ivy, what is all this?",S01E10,309
It's your fault for giving me a credit card.,S01E10,310
Right.,S01E10,311
The emergency credit card.,S01E10,312
Some of this stuff could be used in an emergency.,S01E10,313
"Right, like if we run into a giant foam nose.",S01E10,314
It looks like he's having fun.,S01E10,315

a lot easier without your helpful suggestions.,S01E10,350
"Oh, well, here's a helpful suggestion:",S01E10,351
Take him out of here or I take you out of here.,S01E10,352
"Oh, you shouldn't have said that,",S01E10,353
'cause now Ivy's about to get out of her chair.,S01E10,354

And how about a little of this?,S01E10,396
Great.,S01E10,397
Wait.,S01E10,398
Get my better side.,S01E10,399
Wow.,S01E10,400
"Mom, you're a natural.",S01E10,401
"Yeah, the camera loves you.",S01E10,402
You two are so grounded.,S01E10,403
"Then the police politely asked us to leave,",S01E10,404
At which point Uncle Mel invited them to kiss something,S01E10,405
That had been on the jumbo screen.,S01E10,406
"Oh, good.",S01E10,407
All right.,S01E10,408
Now you know why I wanted you to stay away from your Uncle Mel.,S01E10,409
"The guy's a maniac, especially when it comes to baseball.",S01E10,410
"Yeah, that would've been useful information.",S01E10,411
You know what? Just go to bed.,S01E10,412
I really don't want to talk about this anymore.,S01E10,413
"Well, there is one more thing",S01E10,414
I should tell you about Uncle Mel.,S01E10,415
Yeah? What's that?,S01E10,416
He's in the living room.,S01E10,417
What?!,S01E10,418
You have to talk to him.,S01E10,419
"No, I don't.",S01E10,420
I don't.,S01E10,421
I've got nothing to say to him.,S01E10,422
"What is this all about, anyway? Why won't anybody tell me?",S01E10,423
Because it's ancient history.,S01E10,424
All right? It's done.,S01E10,425
It's forgotten about.,S01E10,426
I've moved on. Now get that old fart out of my house!,S01E10,427
Be right back.,S01E10,428
So dad says welcome.,S01E10,429
"He doesn't want to talk to me, does he?",S01E10,430
"Well, I don't want to talk to him either!",S01E10,431
And you can tell him I said that.,S01E10,432
I'll be right back.,S01E10,433
Uncle Mel says he loves you.,S01E10,434
Really?,S01E10,435
Uncle Mel said that?,S01E10,436
"Yeah, he said something like that.",S01E10,437
It's so long since I've been in the living room.,S01E10,438
"Well, when is he gonna leave the living room?",S01E10,439
"Okay, Uncle Mel wants to sort this thing out.",S01E10,440
Maybe you should start.,S01E10,441
I think he should start.,S01E10,442
I'll be right back.,S01E10,443
Dad says he loves you.,S01E10,444
Hogwash!,S01E10,445
And he thinks it would help,S01E10,446
if you told me what this feud was about.,S01E10,447
"When your father was 10 years old, I was his baseball coach.",S01E10,448
Oh.,S01E10,449
Now I get it.,S01E10,450
What's that supposed to mean?,S01E10,451
"Well, you get a little bit too excited about baseball.",S01E10,452
I share my opinions!,S01E10,453
"Anyway, I gave him some constructive criticism",S01E10,454
You said I swung like a girl!,S01E10,455
I was sugar-coating it! You swung like a baby girl!,S01E10,456
"Hey, we're talking.",S01E10,457
This is a start.,S01E10,458
You humiliated me in front sof the entire team.,S01E10,459
I was trying to make you better.,S01E10,460
"Well, you didn't yell at any of the other kids.",S01E10,461
"Because I didn't care about any of the other kids, fathead!",S01E10,462
Whoa. Did you hear that?,S01E10,463
Before the fathead part.,S01E10,464
He said he cared about you.,S01E10,465
I was trying to make you tough,S01E10,466
And I guess,S01E10,467
sometimes I got a little carried away.,S01E10,468
I'm sorry.,S01E10,469
We have an apology.,S01E10,470
"Hey, dad.",S01E10,471
"Well, maybe sometimes I was a little oversensitive",S01E10,472
And I'm sorry.,S01E10,473
And a return apology.,S01E10,474
Now you know what we do in this family after we fight?,S01E10,475
I'm hoping eat.,S01E10,476
We hug.,S01E10,477
Hugging's for girls.,S01E10,478
Baby girls.,S01E10,479

Be back in 20 minutes.,S01E10,482
Right over there.,S01E10,483
Come here.,S01E10,484
"You did good, kid.",S01E10,485
Thank you.,S01E10,486
"Yeah, well,you guys are always saying",S01E10,487
how important family is.,S01E10,488
Yes.,S01E10,489
"Yes, it is.",S01E10,490
He just walked into the'?,S01E10,491
I'm afraid so.,S01E10,492
"Hey, Mel, That's not a bathroom.",S01E10,493
It is now!,S01E10,494
"Well, Charlie, here I am waiting for you and mom,",S01E10,495
"'cause mom said I have to see this, whatever this is.",S01E10,496
Here we come.,S01E10,497
Look at you two!,S01E10,498
Why are you dressed like that?,S01E10,499
"Well, we had a casting.",S01E10,500
"In the professional modeling business,",S01E10,501
That's what an audition is called,S01E10,502
A casting.,S01E10,503
So you're a professional model now?,S01E10,504
"Oh, don't act surprised, Teddy.",S01E10,505
I think we all knew this day was coming.,S01E10,506
She's a model now.,S01E10,507
"If I knew raising parents was gonna be this hard,",S01E10,508
Never would've done it.,S01E10,509
But soon enough it'll be your turn,S01E10,510
"So good luck, Charlie.",S01E10,511
P.,S01E10,512

Someone will be by to collect my things.,S01E11,288
Hey what are you doing out here?,S01E11,289
Just thinking.,S01E11,290
P.,S01E11,291
J.,S01E11,292
and the Vibe broke up today.,S01E11,293
Oh well son it's hard to keep a band together.,S01E11,294
And you guys did have some challenges,S01E11,295
Most of them musical.,S01E11,296
We'd still be together,S01E11,297
if Emmett wasn't jealous of my girlfriend.,S01E11,298
Son you've been spending an awful lot of time with Madison.,S01E11,299
Now did you ever consider that maybe Emmett feels rejected?,S01E11,300
By my girlfriend?,S01E11,301
By you.,S01E11,302
Because I have a girlfriend.,S01E11,303
Because you've been ignoring him.,S01E11,304
Because of my girlfriend.,S01E11,305
P.,S01E11,306
J.,S01E11,307
I'm ready to break up with you.,S01E11,308
Son you can't let a girl,S01E11,309
Come between you and your best friend.,S01E11,310
But Madison's softer and smells better than Emmett.,S01E11,311
Look trust me on this okay?,S01E11,312
I nearly made the same mistake,S01E11,313
When I was dating Madison's mom.,S01E11,314
Really? What happened?,S01E11,315
Katherine was too clingy,S01E11,316
Too demanding.,S01E11,317
She came between me and my friends,S01E11,318
So I did what I had to do,S01E11,319
Let her go,S01E11,320
Said goodbye,S01E11,321
No more Bobby love for her.,S01E11,322
Bobby love? That's what she called you?,S01E11,323
Oh you know it.,S01E11,324
Um that one we don't need to share with your mom.,S01E11,325
This is weird. I don't usually get invited,S01E11,326
To play dates with the kids I beat up.,S01E11,327
About that I talked to Gabe,S01E11,328
And turns out he kinds of likes you too.,S01E11,329
He does?,S01E11,330
Why are you clenching your fist?,S01E11,331
I feel like punching someone.,S01E11,332
Okay well we need to work on,S01E11,333
how you express yourself with boys.,S01E11,334
Why don't we try a little role-playing okay?,S01E11,335
I'll be Gabe.,S01E11,336
You'll be you.,S01E11,337
Okay.,S01E11,338
So let's pretend we run into each other at school.,S01E11,339
- Hi Jo.,S01E11,340
- Hi gabe.,S01E11,341
I like your jacket.,S01E11,342
Well somebody knows karate.,S01E11,343
Sorry.,S01E11,344
It was a reflex.,S01E11,345
Let me try again.,S01E11,346
Okay but this time,S01E11,347
Let's keep our hands to ourselves okay?,S01E11,348
Got it.,S01E11,349
Okay.,S01E11,350
Hi Jo.,S01E11,351
Hi Gabe.,S01E11,352
Want to sit with me at lunch?,S01E11,353
Yah!,S01E11,354
I see you found a loophole.,S01E11,355
You didn't say anything about the feet.,S01E11,356
And now you've learned the word loophole.,S01E11,357
Now try this time,S01E11,358
With no hands and no feet,S01E11,359
Or anything else you could hit me with.,S01E11,360
Got it.,S01E11,361
Hi Jo.,S01E11,362
You look nice.,S01E11,363
Very good Jo.,S01E11,364
You clenched your fist and then you unclenched.,S01E11,365
That is called progress.,S01E11,366
Feels weird without hitting,S01E11,367
But I kind of like it.,S01E11,368
What is she doing here?,S01E11,369
No no it's okay.,S01E11,370
You have nothing to worry about.,S01E11,371
Right Jo?,S01E11,372
Right.,S01E11,373
Hey Gabe.,S01E11,374
You look nice.,S01E11,375
What?,S01E11,376
She gave you a compliment.,S01E11,377
Say something nice back.,S01E11,378
Uh,S01E11,379
Your hair looks softer than your fists?,S01E11,380
Thanks.,S01E11,381
Why don't you two hang out for a while?,S01E11,382
I'll be upstairs trying to decide,S01E11,383
If I should apply ice or heat.,S01E11,384
So what do you like to do?,S01E11,385
I like monster trucks,S01E11,386
Mixed martial arts and dolls.,S01E11,387
You like video games?,S01E11,388
What do you got?,S01E11,389
Galaxy of Death.,S01E11,390
Is it violent?,S01E11,391
Level two comes with the barf bags.,S01E11,392
It's really fun.,S01E11,393
You had me at barf bag.,S01E11,394
Hey what are you doing here?,S01E11,395
I'm between deliveries,S01E11,396
But I really wanted to say something to you.,S01E11,397
First I'm like totally psyched that you're my girlfriend.,S01E11,398
Great. Anything else?,S01E11,399
Well yeah. I was just thinking,S01E11,400
That we should be spending a little less time together,S01E11,401
You know so we still have time for friends.,S01E11,402
Works for me.,S01E11,403
Not starting right now. Madison what's going on?,S01E11,404
Nothing.,S01E11,405
Gotta get to work babe.,S01E11,406
Who's that?,S01E11,407
Nobody.,S01E11,408
See you later babe.,S01E11,409
Nice hat.,S01E11,410
Thanks.,S01E11,411
You too.,S01E11,412
Who was that?,S01E11,413
Just the pizza delivery guy.,S01E11,414
Really? Don't they usually deliver pizzas,S01E11,415
To your house not from your house?,S01E11,416
I don't,S01E11,417
And don't they usually not kiss the customers,S01E11,418
And call them babe?,S01E11,419
You were cheating on me with Pizza Pirate.,S01E11,420
No actually I was cheating on Pizza Pirate,S01E11,421
With kwikki chikki.,S01E11,422
That's it.,S01E11,423
We're through.,S01E11,424
Are you breaking up with me?,S01E11,425
Unless you promise never to see him again.,S01E11,426
Yeah we should probably break up.,S01E11,427
He gave me a whole bunch of coupons.,S01E11,428
Get off me! Help! Ow!,S01E11,429
Jo what are you doing?,S01E11,430
This is not the way to express yourself.,S01E11,431
This is not about me liking Gabe.,S01E11,432
This is about him cheating at Galaxy of Death.,S01E11,433
I didn't cheat.,S01E11,434
Get this whacko off me!,S01E11,435
Come on Jo get off him.,S01E11,436
Let go.,S01E11,437
Let go.,S01E11,438
Whoa!,S01E11,439
You want some of this?,S01E11,440
Hey Charlie.,S01E11,441
Well today was a bad day for the Duncan kids.,S01E11,442
We learned that sometimes love hurts.,S01E11,443
No kidding.,S01E11,444
Jo dislocated my shoulder.,S01E11,445
Madison dislocated my heart.,S01E11,446
Well maybe love gets easier as we get older.,S01E11,447
Honey it's no Kitty-kat but at least it's a nickname.,S01E11,448
Amy-potomus?,S01E11,449
Well when you say it like that,S01E11,450
Or maybe love never gets easier.,S01E11,451
Then again you might be the one to figure that out.,S01E11,452
Good luck with that Charlie.,S01E11,453
Hi.,S01E11,454
Heard about your breakup.,S01E11,455
Who told you?,S01E11,456
I saw you change your online status,S01E11,457
From in a relationship to dumped.,S01E11,458
Bring it here.,S01E11,459
It hurts so much.,S01E11,460
I know.,S01E11,461
Emmett's here.,S01E11,462
Let it out.,S01E11,463
And ignore my last voicemail.,S01E11,464
- What? - No no no no.,S01E11,465
Hey Gabe.,S01E11,466
Nice backpack.,S01E11,467
What do you want Jo?,S01E11,468
I think I was pretty clear.,S01E11,469
I want your backpack.,S01E11,470
No.,S01E11,471
I'm sorry did you just say no?,S01E11,472
You heard me.,S01E11,473
You're not bullying me anymore.,S01E11,474
What you're gonna sic your sister on me again?,S01E11,475
I'm not afraid of her.,S01E11,476
I have more than one sister.,S01E11,477
And that's after only one karate lesson.,S01E11,478
"Hey, Charlie, check this out.",S01E12,0
Here's something nobody has ever seen before.,S01E12,1
Gabe is brushing his hair,S01E12,2
Do you have to videotape everything we do?,S01E12,3
This isn't a reality show.,S01E12,4
"Oh, I know it's not reality because",S01E12,5
he took a shower without being asked.,S01E12,6
You know what I think?,S01E12,7
I think you like someone.,S01E12,8
What if I do? No big deal.,S01E12,9
Are you kidding? Your first crush is a huge deal.,S01E12,10
"Look, she is a girl.",S01E12,11
I'm a guy.,S01E12,12
These things happen every day.,S01E12,13
Not to you.,S01E12,14
I know. Can you believe it?,S01E12,15
"Hey, kids, come on, let's go.",S01E12,16
P.,S01E12,17
J.,S01E12,18
"Honey, can you watch charlie after school?.",S01E12,19
I have to work.,S01E12,20
I can't.,S01E12,21
I'm working too.,S01E12,22
I can take charlie with me if you want.,S01E12,23
You want to help your big brother deliver chicken?,S01E12,24
Or you could come to the hospital,S01E12,25
And help mommy change bedpans.,S01E12,26
You take her.,S01E12,27
"Gabe, are you wearing aftershave?",S01E12,28
A little.,S01E12,29
Why would you do that? You're not shaving yet.,S01E12,30
"As long as we're being logical,",S01E12,31
why do you still have a comb?,S01E12,32
Get in the car.,S01E12,33
Today's all burnt toast{\i0},S01E12,34
"Running late, and dad jokes{\i0}",S01E12,35
Has anybody seen my left shoe{\i0},S01E12,36
"I close my eyes, take a bite{\i0}",S01E12,37
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud{\i0}",S01E12,38
There it is up on the roof{\i0},S01E12,39
"I've been there, I've survived{\i0}",S01E12,40
So just take my advice{\i0},S01E12,41
"Hang in there, baby,{\i0}",S01E12,42
Things are crazy{\i0},S01E12,43
But I know your future is bright{\i0},S01E12,44
"Hang in there, Baby{\i0}",S01E12,45
There is no maybe{\i0},S01E12,46
Eveything turns out all right{\i0},S01E12,47
Sure life is up and down{\i0},S01E12,48
"But trust me, it comes back all around{\i0}",S01E12,49
You're gonna love who you turn out to be{\i0},S01E12,50
"Hang in there, Baby{\i0}",S01E12,51
"Okay, this is my chance.",S01E12,52
Don't blow it.,S01E12,53
Say something to her.,S01E12,54
"H-h-hi, Kit.",S01E12,55
"Hellllooo, Kit!",S01E12,56
"Yo yo yo, Kit!",S01E12,57
My mouth's so dry.,S01E12,58
I need juice.,S01E12,59
It's juice.,S01E12,60
This is not pee.,S01E12,61
That went well.,S01E12,62
Is your sister home?,S01E12,63
Yes.,S01E12,64
Who was that?,S01E12,65
Mrs.,S01E12,66
Dabney with her stupid questions.,S01E12,67
I have a follow-up question--,S01E12,68
May I speak to your sister?,S01E12,69
"What can I do for you, mrs. Dabney?",S01E12,70
I'm going out of town for a couple of days,S01E12,71
And I was wondering if y'd be kind enough,S01E12,72
to look after my cat Caboodle.,S01E12,73
"Oh, I don't know.",S01E12,74
I'm awfully busy.,S01E12,75
I'll pay you $20 a day.,S01E12,76
My schedule just opened up.,S01E12,77
Mm-hmm.,S01E12,78
"I can trust you, right?",S01E12,79
Of course.,S01E12,80
You do seem to be,S01E12,81
the least disturbed of all the Duncan kids.,S01E12,82
What an almost sweet thing to say.,S01E12,83
You need to know that Caboodle,S01E12,84
Is the most important thing in the world to me.,S01E12,85
How's mr. Dabney doing?,S01E12,86
"Like I said, love that Caboodle.",S01E12,87
Who is it?,S01E12,88
Kwikki Chikki.,S01E12,89
"Oh, hello.",S01E12,90
"Hi, it's $21.",S01E12,91
07.,S01E12,92
"Oh, okay. Who is this cutie pie?",S01E12,93
I'm p.,S01E12,94
J.,S01E12,95
I meant the other cutie pie.,S01E12,96
"Oh, this is Charlie.",S01E12,97
She's my baby sister.,S01E12,98
"Why, isn't she the most precious thing in the whole world?",S01E12,99
"Yeah, my mom's at the hospital,",S01E12,100
so I'm looking after her.,S01E12,101
"Oh, you poor dear.",S01E12,102
Keep the change.,S01E12,103
Are you sure? This is almost a $20 tip.,S01E12,104
"Oh, you need it more than I do,",S01E12,105
What with your mom being in the hospital and all.,S01E12,106
"Oh, you think my mom is in--",S01E12,107
I'm not gonna lie to you.,S01E12,108
It's been hard.,S01E12,109
Enjoy your chicken.,S01E12,110
"Charlie, welcome to the chicken delivery business.",S01E12,111
Give him dry food twice a day,S01E12,112
And make sure his water bowl is always filled.,S01E12,113
"Oh, and my sister Virginia is coming by later for a play date.",S01E12,114
You want me to have a play date with your sister?,S01E12,115
Not you-- Caboodle.,S01E12,116
Virginia brings her cat Stanley over.,S01E12,117
What a ridiculous name for a cat.,S01E12,118
Caboodle?,S01E12,119
Stanley,S01E12,120
"Oh, I should go.",S01E12,121
"But so my little Caboodie won't make a scene,",S01E12,122
You need to distract him.,S01E12,123
Should I pretend to be a mouse?,S01E12,124
Yes.,S01E12,125
I was joking.,S01E12,126
I wasn't.,S01E12,127
The cat seems fine to me.,S01E12,128
I'm paying you.,S01E12,129
Now put him down and act like a mouse.,S01E12,130
Squeak squeak.,S01E12,131
You can do better than that.,S01E12,132
"Bare your teeth, wiggle your nose",S01E12,133
And act like you're eating a piece of cheese.,S01E12,134
"Now keep doing that for 20 minutes,",S01E12,135
And he should be fine.,S01E12,136
"Goodbye, my Caboodle.",S01E12,137
"Teddy honey, did you lose something?",S01E12,138
Only my dignity.,S01E12,139
"Mom, can you help me with something?",S01E12,140
"Sure, honey. What can I do for you?",S01E12,141
"Well, I have this friend",S01E12,142
And he needs to know how to talk to girls.,S01E12,143
Does this friend have a name?,S01E12,144
No-orman.,S01E12,145
No-orman.,S01E12,146
That's an odd name.,S01E12,147
"Well, I think he's from No-orway.",S01E12,148
"Gabe honey, I'm your mom.",S01E12,149
You don't have to be embarrassed,S01E12,150
About telling me about your first crushy-wushy.,S01E12,151
I'm just gonna go look it up on the internet.,S01E12,152
"No no no, it's okay.",S01E12,153
I'm sorry.,S01E12,154
I'm sorry.,S01E12,155
"Okay, so what have you said to her so far?",S01E12,156
"Um, I said,",S01E12,157
"that was juice, not pee.",S01E12,158
And then she walked away.,S01E12,159
"Oh, no-orman.",S01E12,160
"Every time I get near her,",S01E12,161
"My heart starts pounding, my hands get all sweaty",S01E12,162
And I can't speak.,S01E12,163
"Oh, you've got it bad.",S01E12,164
I remember my first crush.,S01E12,165
Was it dad?,S01E12,166
"Sure, why not?",S01E12,167
So what do I do? How do I talk to her?,S01E12,168
"Well, when you start to get a little nervous,",S01E12,169
Just ask her questions.,S01E12,170
Let her do the talking.,S01E12,171
Find things you have in common.,S01E12,172
So just ask her stuff and listen to the answers?,S01E12,173
That sounds easy.,S01E12,174
Sure.,S01E12,175
Relationships are a piece of cake.,S01E12,176
That's why married people are always so happy.,S01E12,177
Did dad ever get nervous talking to you?,S01E12,178
"Oh, when your dad and I first started dating",S01E12,179
We didn't do a lot of talking. Mostly we just--,S01E12,180
Just what?,S01E12,181
Played checkers--,S01E12,182
Lots and lots of checkers.,S01E12,183
"Hey, dad.",S01E12,184
Hey.,S01E12,185
"You're taking care of Charlie tomorrow afternoon, right?",S01E12,186
I believe I am.,S01E12,187
"You know, I was thinking maybe",S01E12,188
she should come to work with me.,S01E12,189
Why?,S01E12,190
Because I feel I didn't do enough to help out,S01E12,191
When Teddy and Gabe were babies.,S01E12,192
Enough? You didn't do anything.,S01E12,193
I know.,S01E12,194
And it haunts me.,S01E12,195
It haunts you?,S01E12,196
Yes.,S01E12,197
That's why I have to make it up to you with Charlie.,S01E12,198
Okay.,S01E12,199
"I'll miss you, dad.",S01E12,200
"Oh, that boy's up to something.",S01E12,201
I should probably get into this.,S01E12,202
"Eh, he's all the way upstairs.",S01E12,203
Listen and find things in common.,S01E12,204
Listen and find things in common.,S01E12,205
- Hi.,S01E12,206
- Hi.,S01E12,207
Tell me about yourself.,S01E12,208
Why?,S01E12,209
"I mean, only if you want to.",S01E12,210
"Okay, what do you want to know?",S01E12,211
Tell me about your family.,S01E12,212
"Oh, the family.",S01E12,213
Actually there's not much to tell.,S01E12,214
I'm an only child.,S01E12,215
Me too.,S01E12,216
Cool.,S01E12,217
What else?,S01E12,218
"Well, my parents are divorced.",S01E12,219
Mine too.,S01E12,220
Who do you live with?,S01E12,221
Who do you live with?,S01E12,222
My mom.,S01E12,223
Me too.,S01E12,224
"Wow, we really have a lot in common.",S01E12,225
"You know, I had a feeling we might.",S01E12,226
Want half of a peanut-butter sandwich?,S01E12,227
"No, thanks.",S01E12,228
I'm allergic to peanuts.,S01E12,229
Me too.,S01E12,230
"You dnt do much, do you?",S01E12,231
"Hey hey, catch.",S01E12,232
Or stay.,S01E12,233
Good cat.,S01E12,234
"Mrs. Dabney, why are you back here?",S01E12,235
"Oh, I'm not Estelle.",S01E12,236
I'm her sister Virginia.,S01E12,237
"Wow, you really look like Mrs.",S01E12,238
Dabney.,S01E12,239
Except for my laugh lines.,S01E12,240
Estelle doesn't have any of those.,S01E12,241
"Gabe, this is mrs.",S01E12,242
Dabney's twin sister Virginia.,S01E12,243
This is my brother gabe.,S01E12,244
"Oh, you look like a nice little boy.",S01E12,245
Would you like some candy?,S01E12,246
Only if you eat one first.,S01E12,247
You're as cute as the dickens.,S01E12,248
"Okay, this is dang freaky.",S01E12,249
"Okay, Stanley.",S01E12,250
Let's go play with Caboodle.,S01E12,251
Here we go.,S01E12,252
Uh-oh.,S01E12,253
What's wrong?,S01E12,254
Caboodle always gets excited when Stanley arrives.,S01E12,255
He's just been lying on the couch all day.,S01E12,256
Do you think he's sick?,S01E12,257
You'd better hope not.,S01E12,258
I'd hate to be in your shoes,S01E12,259
If something happened to my sister's baby.,S01E12,260
"Well, it's not my fault.",S01E12,261
"She'd understand that, right?",S01E12,262
"Oh, yeah.",S01E12,263
She's very understanding.,S01E12,264
"Come on, caboodle, perk up.",S01E12,265
This does not look good.,S01E12,266
"Oh, I know what will cheer you up--",S01E12,267
"Mr. Mouse, right?",S01E12,268
This does not look good either.,S01E12,269
"The whole family's pitching in to help out with Charlie,",S01E12,270
Because my mom's in the hospital.,S01E12,271
Thank you.,S01E12,272
And thank you.,S01E12,273
"Used to be her Halloween costume,",S01E12,274
"But with mom in the hospital,",S01E12,275
We can't afford to buy her a winter coat--,S01E12,276
A new winter coat.,S01E12,277
Is your mom any better?,S01E12,278
"The same,",S01E12,279
But we're trying to be brave.,S01E12,280
You poor thing.,S01E12,281
Aww.,S01E12,282
It's hardest on the little ones.,S01E12,283
"Whenever we visit mom in the hospital,",S01E12,284
Charlie does this.,S01E12,285
Mama mama mama.,S01E12,286
"Warren, get out here!",S01E12,287
And bring your wallet!,S01E12,288
"Thanks for coming on such short notice, Dr.",S01E12,289
Tushy.,S01E12,290
It's pronounced Tushy.,S01E12,291
you don't have to thank me.,S01E12,292
Caboodle Dabney is one of my favorite patients.,S01E12,293
I didn't know veterinarians made house calls.,S01E12,294
"Oh, they don't.",S01E12,295
I'm a therapist.,S01E12,296
A therapist for cats?,S01E12,297
And birds.,S01E12,298
But never at the same time.,S01E12,299
You only make that mistake once.,S01E12,300
Uh-huh.,S01E12,301
Huh.,S01E12,302
Oh.,S01E12,303
So what's wrong with caboodle?,S01E12,304
"Well, his aura is off.",S01E12,305
His chakras are out of line.,S01E12,306
How's his poop?,S01E12,307
Fine. How's yours?,S01E12,308
"Well, that's a little personal,",S01E12,309
"But since you ask, super good and getting better.",S01E12,310
"Maybe we should get back to the cat, Dr.",S01E12,311
Tushy.,S01E12,312
It's Tushy.,S01E12,313
Tushy.,S01E12,314
"Huh-uh, tushy.",S01E12,315
Tushy?,S01E12,316
Tushy Tushy Tushy.,S01E12,317
Do you have a first name?,S01E12,318
Tish.,S01E12,319
Tish Tushy?,S01E12,320
Doctor.,S01E12,321
"Anyway, can you fix him?",S01E12,322
No.,S01E12,323
But you can.,S01E12,324
Caboodle is feeling abandoned.,S01E12,325
He needs to know he's safe and secure.,S01E12,326
Now close your eyes and send him a thought,S01E12,327
To let him know you care.,S01E12,328
Can't you give him a shot or--?,S01E12,329
Send him a thought.,S01E12,330
Send him a thought.,S01E12,331
Send him a thought.,S01E12,332
Do you have a thought?,S01E12,333
"Oh, I'm having a few of them.",S01E12,334
Kit.,S01E12,335
"Hi, Gabe.",S01E12,336
What are you doing here?,S01E12,337
I told my mom all about you,S01E12,338
And we just wanted to say hi.,S01E12,339
"Yeah, it is so wonderful that Kit met someone",S01E12,340
With a family just like ours.,S01E12,341
Okay.,S01E12,342
Do you mind if we come in?,S01E12,343
"Yeah, sure, I guess.",S01E12,344
Okay.,S01E12,345
"You know, I'll actually be right back.",S01E12,346
Okay.,S01E12,347
I have a big problem. What are you doing?,S01E12,348
I'm readjusting caboodle's aura.,S01E12,349
Duh.,S01E12,350
I'm in big trouble.,S01E12,351
What's wrong?,S01E12,352
The girl I like is here with her mom.,S01E12,353
What's wrong with that?,S01E12,354
I told her mom and dad are divorced,S01E12,355
And I'm an only child. What am I gonna do?,S01E12,356
"Okay, the first thing you're gonna do is calm down.",S01E12,357
Your negative energy is upsetting the cat.,S01E12,358
You gotta help me.,S01E12,359
"Okay, relax,",S01E12,360
Or later you're gonna have trouble with your poop.,S01E12,361
Teddy.,S01E12,362
"Fine, I'll go and get rid of them.",S01E12,363
"Wait, they can't know you're my sister.",S01E12,364
"Right, so I will be somebody else.",S01E12,365
"Hi, I'm Teddy, the housekeeper.  See?",S01E12,366
"Hi, I'm Dana.",S01E12,367
This is Kit.,S01E12,368
Why are you wearing a cat?,S01E12,369
Because in my country we have a saying,S01E12,370
the house looks its best when a cat's on your chest.,S01E12,371
What country is that?,S01E12,372
Canada.,S01E12,373
"Mrs. Duncan isn't home and I have a house to clean,",S01E12,374
"So as we say in my country, oot.",S01E12,375
oot oot.,S01E12,376
"Okay, could you just tell her we stopped by?",S01E12,377
You betcha.,S01E12,378
"Hey, everybody.",S01E12,379
Who's that?,S01E12,380
That's the chicken delivery guy.,S01E12,381
"Dude, what's with the cat?",S01E12,382
None of your business.,S01E12,383
"And don't call me dude, chicken delivery guy.",S01E12,384
Now come out to the porch,S01E12,385
Where I will teach you how to use a doorbell.,S01E12,386
You know what's weird?,S01E12,387
He didn't have any chicken.,S01E12,388
He's just here to take our order.,S01E12,389
Then another guy comes and delivers it.,S01E12,390
It's not a good system.,S01E12,391
I'm the chicken delivery guy.,S01E12,392
See?,S01E12,393
That is such an adorable baby. Is she--?,S01E12,394
Part of the promotion.,S01E12,395
"Right, P.",S01E12,396
J.,S01E12,397
",.",S01E12,398
Which may or may not be your name?,S01E12,399
That's right.,S01E12,400
A promotion.,S01E12,401
Kwikki chikki is introducing,S01E12,402
Baby back ribs.,S01E12,403
And they make you carry around a baby?,S01E12,404
That comes from corporate.,S01E12,405
They have no idea what it's like out in the field.,S01E12,406
Look who's here. Who is here?,S01E12,407
"Hi, I'm Bob.",S01E12,408
The exterminator.,S01E12,409
"Yeah, I'm a little more than that.",S01E12,410
Why are you wearing a cat?,S01E12,411
"Oh, forget the cat. There is a skunk in the backyard",S01E12,412
And I demand you go exterminate it right now.,S01E12,413
What are you talking about?,S01E12,414
Skunks don't come out during the day.,S01E12,415
"Well, then go out and tell him that.",S01E12,416
Sorry about that.,S01E12,417
"He does good work, but he's a little chatty.",S01E12,418
Mom? No!,S01E12,419
"Well, hello to you too.",S01E12,420
Hello.,S01E12,421
"Hi, I'm Dana.",S01E12,422
I'm Kit's mom.,S01E12,423
I'm Amy.,S01E12,424
This baby is so cute.,S01E12,425
Isn't she?,S01E12,426
She sure makes me want some baby back ribs.,S01E12,427
Beg pardon?,S01E12,428
No skunk back there.,S01E12,429
"Oh, hey, sweetie.",S01E12,430
Hey.,S01E12,431
"Wow, you're very friendly with the exterminator.",S01E12,432
I do sleep next to him every night.,S01E12,433
I didn't realize you had a boyfriend.,S01E12,434
She's got a what?,S01E12,435
The exterminator is your boyfriend.,S01E12,436
The exterminator is my husband.,S01E12,437
So you remarried?,S01E12,438
I was never divorced.,S01E12,439
"Well, Kit told me you were.",S01E12,440
Because that's what gabe told me.,S01E12,441
I may have told a teeny little lie.,S01E12,442
Sorry.,S01E12,443
I just wanted you to like me.,S01E12,444
"Gabe, you should have just told me the truth.",S01E12,445
"I know. And I promise,",S01E12,446
From now on I'll always be completely honest with you.,S01E12,447
I'm back.,S01E12,448
Now who's this?,S01E12,449
That's either virginia who's nice and gives out candy,S01E12,450
Or Mrs.,S01E12,451
Dabney-- her evil twin.,S01E12,452
We're out of here.,S01E12,453
"Well, Charlie, the good news is Caboodle's fine.",S01E12,454
Turns out all he needed was a trip to the litter box.,S01E12,455
But the bad news is Gabe's romance with Kit is over.,S01E12,456
"Well, the good news is",S01E12,457
I don't have to shower anymore.,S01E12,458
That's really good news.,S01E12,459
So if your brother gabe,S01E12,460
"goes to give you a hug,",S01E12,461
"Well, good luck, Charlie.",S01E12,462
Don't worry.,S01E12,463
That won't happen.,S01E12,464
"Hey, mom, Charlie and I have to work a double tomorrow.",S01E12,465
What? Why do you keep taking Charlie to work?,S01E12,466
Because I love her.,S01E12,467
Nobody?,S01E12,468
May I help you?,S01E12,469
I just wanted to drop off this casserole.,S01E12,470
Excuse me?,S01E12,471
"Well, with P.",S01E12,472
J.,S01E12,473
's mom being in the hospital.,S01E12,474
And him practically having to raise Charlie on his own--,S01E12,475
It's just so sad.,S01E12,476
You think--,S01E12,477
"Gosh, that smells good.",S01E12,478
It is sad.,S01E12,479
- I find when people are in need-- - Thank you.,S01E12,480
"Kids, dinner's ready.",S01E12,481
It's open.,S01E12,482
There's another one?,S01E12,483
There's another one?,S01E12,484
What?,S01E12,485
I don't know.,S01E12,486
"We're the world famous quintuplets, Wisconsin.",S01E12,487
We were the biggest news story of 1958.,S01E12,488
This was supposed to be a family reunion.,S01E12,489
What happened?,S01E12,490
Estelle kicked us out.,S01E12,491
That woman's not right.,S01E12,492
Tell me about it!,S01E12,493
"All right, class.",S01E13,0
These progress reports will let you know,S01E13,1
"how you're doing in English so far,",S01E13,2
and for many of you I use the word progress loosely.,S01E13,3
Please let it be an A.,S01E13,4
Please let it be an A.,S01E13,5
Please let it be a C.,S01E13,6
Please let it be a C.,S01E13,7
"Mr. Gerkin, the fast food industry is booming",S01E13,8
and offers a bright future.,S01E13,9
This is great.,S01E13,10
This is terrible.,S01E13,11
I got a B.,S01E13,12
So did I.,S01E13,13
I can't believe I got a real B.,S01E13,14
As opposed to what?,S01E13,15
A D that I have to write another D on top of,S01E13,16
to make it look like a B.,S01E13,17
"Mr. Dingwall,",S01E13,18
can I ask you a quick question?,S01E13,19
You just did.,S01E13,20
Goodbye.,S01E13,21
"No, actually it's about my grade.",S01E13,22
I was kind of expecting an A.,S01E13,23
A,S01E13,24
the same letter that begins the words annoying,S01E13,25
and adios.,S01E13,26
Can you just explain to me why I got a B?,S01E13,27
English is my best subject.,S01E13,28
Although my math and science teachers would argue with that.,S01E13,29
Here's another one-- aloha.,S01E13,30
Today's all burnt toast{\i0},S01E13,31
"Running late, and dad jokes{\i0}",S01E13,32
Has anybody seen my left shoe{\i0},S01E13,33
"I close my eyes, take a bite{\i0}",S01E13,34
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud{\i0}",S01E13,35
There it is up on the roof{\i0},S01E13,36
"I've been there, I've survived{\i0}",S01E13,37
So just take my advice{\i0},S01E13,38
"Hang in there, baby,{\i0}",S01E13,39
Things are crazy{\i0},S01E13,40
But I know your future is bright{\i0},S01E13,41
"Hang in there, Baby{\i0}",S01E13,42
There is no maybe{\i0},S01E13,43
Eveything turns out all right{\i0},S01E13,44
Sure life is up and down{\i0},S01E13,45
"But trust me, it comes back all around{\i0}",S01E13,46
You're gonna love who you turn out to be{\i0},S01E13,47
"Hang in there, Baby{\i0}",S01E13,48
"Hey, ready for your basketball game?",S01E13,49
Do I have to go?,S01E13,50
All we ever do is lose.,S01E13,51
That is not true.,S01E13,52
Sometimes you forfeit.,S01E13,53
"Oh, honey, it's important to think positive.",S01E13,54
"True, you've lost 11 games in a row",S01E13,55
"and you're dead last in the league, but--",S01E13,56
I don't know where I'm going with this.,S01E13,57
"Bad news, Gabe.",S01E13,58
I can't coach your game today.,S01E13,59
Just got an emergency extermination call.,S01E13,60
What's the big emergency?,S01E13,61
Ladybug infestation.,S01E13,62
Aww.,S01E13,63
"Oh, sure, one's cute.",S01E13,64
Thousands-- unspeakable horror.,S01E13,65
So I guess without a coach,S01E13,66
we won't be able to play our game today.,S01E13,67
"Hey, wait a minute.",S01E13,68
I can coach.,S01E13,69
"That's cute, honey,",S01E13,70
but coaching's a little more complicated than you might think.,S01E13,71
"Oh, honey, I can lose just as good as you can.",S01E13,72
What am I saying? I can't coach.,S01E13,73
I have Mommy & Me with Charlie.,S01E13,74
I could take Charlie to Mommy & Me.,S01E13,75
"Honey, that's cute, but Mommy & Me",S01E13,76
is a little more complicated than you might think.,S01E13,77
"Actually, it's really not.",S01E13,78
You go ahead and take her.,S01E13,79
"All right, honey, looks like you're in.",S01E13,80
Here's the playbook.,S01E13,81
"Now this might be a little over your head,",S01E13,82
so just do your best.,S01E13,83
Xs are our team.,S01E13,84
Os are the other guys.,S01E13,85
"Okay, the xs have lost 11 games in a row, right?",S01E13,86
Right.,S01E13,87
We're gonna be the os this week.,S01E13,88
"Hi, Charlie, it's your big sister Teddy here.",S01E13,89
Or should I say big failure Teddy?,S01E13,90
I just wanted to show you how sad I look after I got my first B.,S01E13,91
And I just want to show you how happy I look when I got my first B.,S01E13,92
Whoo!,S01E13,93
Sorry you had to see that.,S01E13,94
I do not deserve a b.,S01E13,95
I felt the same way.,S01E13,96
"You know, I know why Dingwall gave me a bad grade.",S01E13,97
He just doesn't like me.,S01E13,98
"You know, that could be.",S01E13,99
"Whenever he talks to you, he makes a face like somebody just cut one.",S01E13,100
But it's not fair.,S01E13,101
I never cut one.,S01E13,102
It's always Gerkin.,S01E13,103
So what if Dingwall doesn't like you? Who cares?,S01E13,104
I care.,S01E13,105
No one's ever not liked me before.,S01E13,106
"I don't mean to be conceited, but likable people like me are liked.",S01E13,107
It's just a fact.,S01E13,108
As long as you're not conceited.,S01E13,109
I know what I gotta do--get Dingwall to like me.,S01E13,110
I know what I gotta do-- more dancing.,S01E13,111
I still got some happy left in me.,S01E13,112
You'd better watch out if I ever get an A.,S01E13,113
"Hey, dad.",S01E13,114
"Hey, how was Mommy & Me?",S01E13,115
It was awesome.,S01E13,116
The moms loved me.,S01E13,117
"I told them some jokes, made them laugh,",S01E13,118
taught them how to change their ringtones.,S01E13,119
Did Charlie have a good time?,S01E13,120
I don't know.,S01E13,121
I wasn't really watching her.,S01E13,122
So? How bad was it?,S01E13,123
It was terrible.,S01E13,124
It was terrible for the other team,S01E13,125
because we won! We won. Ooh ooh!,S01E13,126
I don't believe it. Where's Gabe?,S01E13,127
"He went out for ice cream with the rest of the team,",S01E13,128
"right after they carried me to my car,",S01E13,129
chanting Amy! Amy!,S01E13,130
"Really, such a fuss.",S01E13,131
Did the other team just not show up?,S01E13,132
"Oh, they showed up,",S01E13,133
but they wish they hadn't. Kapow!,S01E13,134
That's amazing.,S01E13,135
"Actually, it wasn't as hard as you thought.",S01E13,136
I just told the boys to go out there and have fun.,S01E13,137
Did you at least use the playbook?,S01E13,138
Absolutely.,S01E13,139
"The bench was freezing, so I sat on it.",S01E13,140
Hello.,S01E13,141
"Hey, Angie.",S01E13,142
"Look, I'm sorry I couldn't make it to mommy & me--",S01E13,143
you want to talk to p.,S01E13,144
J.,S01E13,145
?.,S01E13,146
I think he's here.,S01E13,147
Hang on a sec.,S01E13,148
P.,S01E13,149
J.,S01E13,150
Yeah?,S01E13,151
Hello.,S01E13,152
"Oh, hey, Ange.",S01E13,153
"Yeah, it was fun hanging out with you too.",S01E13,154
That's hilarious.,S01E13,155
"Oh no, you didn't.",S01E13,156
You guys mind? This is kinda personal.,S01E13,157
"By the way, did you see Linda's hair?",S01E13,158
Right?,S01E13,159
"Hey, there's my winner.",S01E13,160
"Hey, dad.",S01E13,161
Congratulations.,S01E13,162
"I mean, obviously a fluke, right,",S01E13,163
happening when your mom was coaching?,S01E13,164
But you know what? I think we can build on this.,S01E13,165
Yeah yeah.,S01E13,166
"Dad, we need to talk.",S01E13,167
What about?,S01E13,168
Have a seat.,S01E13,169
Okay.,S01E13,170
What's up?,S01E13,171
These things are never easy.,S01E13,172
What things?,S01E13,173
"Look, the team talked things over",S01E13,174
and we think it's in everyone's best interest,S01E13,175
if we make some changes involving the coaching staff.,S01E13,176
The coaching staff? I'm the coaching staff.,S01E13,177
Yeah.,S01E13,178
"Oh, wait a minute.",S01E13,179
Are you firing me?,S01E13,180
After everything I've done for this team?,S01E13,181
We wish you the best.,S01E13,182
"Oh, come on.",S01E13,183
"Oh, come on.",S01E13,184
"Hey, give me another chance.",S01E13,185
I can turn this thing around.,S01E13,186
I think we're done here.,S01E13,187
"Oh, dad,",S01E13,188
would you send mom in? I have some good news for her.,S01E13,189
"Hey, Mr.",S01E13,190
D.,S01E13,191
Got a little present for you--,S01E13,192
"some yummy homemade brownies, just cause.",S01E13,193
School district policy prohibits me from receiving gifts,S01E13,194
"which, judging by these, does not appear to be a tragedy.",S01E13,195
"Well, I thought you might have a sweet tooth like me--",S01E13,196
"just one more thing we have in common,",S01E13,197
"I mean, besides our ethnic heritage.",S01E13,198
This should be good.,S01E13,199
"Dingwall is a scottish name, like Duncan.",S01E13,200
I looked up your family crest.,S01E13,201
Did you know that it's two eagles in flight?,S01E13,202
"Miss Duncan, let's cut to the chase.",S01E13,203
"You're here about your grade, right?",S01E13,204
You are one sharp scottish cookie.,S01E13,205
The issue is your oral book reports.,S01E13,206
I work very hard on those.,S01E13,207
"They're lifeless and dry,",S01E13,208
and that's coming from me.,S01E13,209
"Okay, so I'll jazz them up.",S01E13,210
Find a way to make the book come alive.,S01E13,211
"Put your energy into that instead of kissing up to your teacher,",S01E13,212
"which I find shallow, insulting and--",S01E13,213
adorable!,S01E13,214
What?,S01E13,215
"Honey, come on, let's go.",S01E13,216
Who-- who-- who is that?,S01E13,217
Who is that?,S01E13,218
That's my mom and my sister Charlie.,S01E13,219
Aren't you the cutest baby ever?,S01E13,220
We like to think so.,S01E13,221
And you look just like your mommy.,S01E13,222
"If you're saying I'm the cutest mommy ever,",S01E13,223
I accept.,S01E13,224
"Teddy dear, I had no idea you had a baby sister.",S01E13,225
Teddy? Dear?,S01E13,226
Who is that? Who is that?,S01E13,227
Who is that?,S01E13,228
What are you doing?,S01E13,229
I'm watching my book.,S01E13,230
For your book report?,S01E13,231
That's right.,S01E13,232
"Aren't you supposed to, oh, I don't know, read your book?",S01E13,233
"Teddy, get with it.",S01E13,234
Kids don't read anymore.,S01E13,235
You're so old school.,S01E13,236
"And if you don't read your book, you're gonna be",S01E13,237
old and still going to school.,S01E13,238
Hey.,S01E13,239
Sorry. I'm just a little upset,S01E13,240
about my conversation with Mr.,S01E13,241
Dingwall.,S01E13,242
"He was telling me how boring I was,",S01E13,243
and then Charlie came in and he lit up like a Christmas tree.,S01E13,244
"Well, there's your answer.",S01E13,245
To what?,S01E13,246
To getting an a.,S01E13,247
You should do your presentation dressed up like a baby.,S01E13,248
You know what? I might have a better idea.,S01E13,249
"And I'd love to hear it,",S01E13,250
but the last of the Mohicans just took off his shirt.,S01E13,251
Gabe.,S01E13,252
"Hey, honey, you coming to Gabe's basketball game?",S01E13,253
What for?,S01E13,254
Because you're his father.,S01E13,255
Or has he fired me from that too?,S01E13,256
You're still upset about this coaching thing?,S01E13,257
Of course not.,S01E13,258
Although according to the by-laws of the Denver junior,S01E13,259
"basketball association, article 17, section 9,",S01E13,260
"the team is not allowed to take a vote and replace me,",S01E13,261
but I've let it go.,S01E13,262
Good.,S01E13,263
Oh.,S01E13,264
"Hi, dad.",S01E13,265
Gabe.,S01E13,266
This is awkward.,S01E13,267
I didn't expect to see you here.,S01E13,268
In my home?,S01E13,269
"Gabe, honey,",S01E13,270
Is there something you would like to say to your father?,S01E13,271
Yeah.,S01E13,272
"Dad, I'm gonna need the whistle.",S01E13,273
"Hey, ange. What are you doing here?",S01E13,274
It's girls' night out.,S01E13,275
"Oh, you're kidding.",S01E13,276
Tonight's not good for me.,S01E13,277
"Actually, I'm here to pick up p.",S01E13,278
J.,S01E13,279
"What's up, girlfriend?",S01E13,280
Ooh ooh!,S01E13,281
Are you going out with the moms?,S01E13,282
"Yeah, gonna have some appetizers,",S01E13,283
"maybe do a little karaoke, just let our hair down.",S01E13,284
"Actually, Jeannie rented a chick flick,",S01E13,285
so we're gonna hang at her place.,S01E13,286
A chick flick?,S01E13,287
I'm good to go.,S01E13,288
Don't wait up.,S01E13,289
"Okay, that's just weird.",S01E13,290
"No, what's weird is that I coach those kids for half a season and--",S01E13,291
"Oh, let it go, Bob.",S01E13,292
"Are you having fun out there, kiddo?",S01E13,293
"Mom, can you not see the scoreboard?",S01E13,294
It's 44-12.,S01E13,295
We're getting creamed.,S01E13,296
"Gabe, over here now.",S01E13,297
What?,S01E13,298
We never should have fired your dad.,S01E13,299
It was your idea.,S01E13,300
"Dude, I was hopped up on ice cream.",S01E13,301
"Well, it's too late now.",S01E13,302
Or is it?,S01E13,303
You know what you gotta do.,S01E13,304
What are you saying?,S01E13,305
I'm saying it's time to hike up your skirt and fire your mom.,S01E13,306
"Hey, mom, we need to talk.",S01E13,307
"Sure. What's on your mind, honey?",S01E13,308
These things are never easy.,S01E13,309
"You're firing me, aren't you?",S01E13,310
Yep.,S01E13,311
"Well, at least one of us is undefeated.",S01E13,312
"Good luck, losers.",S01E13,313
"Hey, dad, old pal, what's goin' on?",S01E13,314
Let me guess--,S01E13,315
"coach fun didn't work out,",S01E13,316
so now you're crawling back to dad.,S01E13,317
"Well, you know what? Maybe I've moved on.",S01E13,318
Fine.,S01E13,319
I'll go ask Nick's dad.,S01E13,320
No no no.,S01E13,321
I'll do it.,S01E13,322
I'll do it.,S01E13,323
"Guys, men, come on, gather round.",S01E13,324
Listen up.,S01E13,325
All right.,S01E13,326
We're gonna pull together.,S01E13,327
We're gonna play as a team.,S01E13,328
And we're gonna give it our all.,S01E13,329
And then we'll win?,S01E13,330
Not a chance.,S01E13,331
But here's what we can do--,S01E13,332
we can go out there and we can lose with dignity.,S01E13,333
Lose with dignity! Lose with dignity!,S01E13,334
Yeah!,S01E13,335
"Hey, guys,",S01E13,336
come on back.,S01E13,337
It's only halftime.,S01E13,338
Animal farm by George orwell.,S01E13,339
Animal farm is a story about what happens,S01E13,340
when idealistic animals take control of their farm,S01E13,341
from the evil human owners.,S01E13,342
Oof.,S01E13,343
Now I'd like to introduce you to some of the animals.,S01E13,344
Meet snowball the pig.,S01E13,345
Charlie's a pig.,S01E13,346
I've died and gone to heaven.,S01E13,347
"Snowball, tell us about yourself.",S01E13,348
"Oh, I'm good-hearted",S01E13,349
and I believe that all animals should be treated fairly,S01E13,350
and share their property equally.,S01E13,351
"Thanks, snowball.",S01E13,352
Time to get back to the farm.,S01E13,353
"Bye, snowball.",S01E13,354
Bye.,S01E13,355
"But all is not well on the farm,",S01E13,356
because here comes--,S01E13,357
"Napoleon, the conqueror pig.",S01E13,358
I am a troublemaker.,S01E13,359
I tell some of the animals they're better than others.,S01E13,360
"That's right, I'm a bad pig.",S01E13,361
Oh oh oh.,S01E13,362
That is my new screen saver.,S01E13,363
"But thankfully, Muriel the goat",S01E13,364
calms things down with some of her words of wisdom.,S01E13,365
"Come on, Muriel.",S01E13,366
I'm gonna see what's keeping her.,S01E13,367
What's the hold up?,S01E13,368
Charlie's kinda gassy.,S01E13,369
Might be those fish sticks we fed her in the cafeteria.,S01E13,370
They're talking back to me too.,S01E13,371
"Okay, I'd better wrap things up.",S01E13,372
Come here.,S01E13,373
Come here.,S01E13,374
Yes yes yes.,S01E13,375
All right.,S01E13,376
Okay.,S01E13,377
And here is Muriel the fast-talking goat.,S01E13,378
"Hey, kids.",S01E13,379
Want to know what I have to say?,S01E13,380
Read the book.,S01E13,381
So in the end the animals become,S01E13,382
just as evil as the humans they overthrew.,S01E13,383
And now you can't tell the animals from the humans.,S01E13,384
"Thank you, everyone.",S01E13,385
"Bravo, Miss Duncan.",S01E13,386
"You made the book come alive,",S01E13,387
and in the most adorable way.,S01E13,388
I'm-- I'm-- I'm so sorry.,S01E13,389
"Ivy, help.",S01E13,390
"Oh, here come the sticks.",S01E13,391
"Well, now it smells like an animal farm.",S01E13,392
"Hey, mom.",S01E13,393
"Hey, dad.",S01E13,394
"Hey, how was story time at the library?",S01E13,395
It was okay.,S01E13,396
We read Everybody Poops.,S01E13,397
The title kind of gives away the ending.,S01E13,398
Did Charlie have fun?,S01E13,399
I don't know.,S01E13,400
We didn't sit together.,S01E13,401
"Anyway, I'm gonna be taking off again soon.",S01E13,402
Going out with the moms again?,S01E13,403
"No no, I'm done with that.",S01E13,404
I'm glad you're over it.,S01E13,405
Me too.,S01E13,406
What was I thinking?,S01E13,407
What do I have in common with a bunch of women in their 30s?,S01E13,408
"Mom, dad, this is Marge,",S01E13,409
the story lady from the library.,S01E13,410
We're going to tea.,S01E13,411
These are your grades on yesterday's final presentations.,S01E13,412
Mr.,S01E13,413
"gerkin, fit yourself with a hairnet.",S01E13,414
Miss Wentz.,S01E13,415
Oh my gosh.,S01E13,416
"Miss Duncan, your grade",S01E13,417
and my dry-cleaning bill.,S01E13,418
Oh my gosh.,S01E13,419
Two Bs in a row?,S01E13,420
What if my mom starts to expect this?,S01E13,421
I'd better turn this into a d.,S01E13,422
Mr.,S01E13,423
Dingwall.,S01E13,424
Yes?,S01E13,425
I just wanted to say thank you for my A.,S01E13,426
"You earned it, for creativity,",S01E13,427
imagination and style.,S01E13,428
Nicely done.,S01E13,429
Thank you.,S01E13,430
Now pretend that bell was a fire alarm,S01E13,431
and the flames are upon us.,S01E13,432
Just one more thing.,S01E13,433
"You know, I had this crazy idea",S01E13,434
that the reason you were being so tough on me,S01E13,435
was because you didn't like me.,S01E13,436
"It's crazy, right?",S01E13,437
"Because obviously you like me, right?",S01E13,438
"Teddy,",S01E13,439
"not everyone in your life is going to like you,",S01E13,440
and the reason may have nothing to do with you.,S01E13,441
Doesn't mean you've failed.,S01E13,442
Just means you're human. Okay?,S01E13,443
Okay.,S01E13,444
"But, you know, you never actually said if you like me--",S01E13,445
okay.,S01E13,446
"Okay, if you like me, don't say a word.",S01E13,447
Goodbye.,S01E13,448
Ugh!,S01E13,449
"Well, Charlie, no more fish sticks for you.",S01E13,450
But thanks for all your help with Mr.,S01E13,451
Dingwall.,S01E13,452
Because of you I got an a. Whoo!,S01E13,453
"And I learned that not everyone is going to like me,",S01E13,454
and I'm okay with that.,S01E13,455
I'm working on being okay with that.,S01E13,456
But just in case,S01E13,457
"Wish me good luck, Charlie.",S01E13,458
Go go go.,S01E13,459
"Come on, come on.",S01E13,460
Have you seen the team?,S01E13,461
They went that away.,S01E13,462
"Come on, come on.",S01E13,463
Have you seen the--?,S01E13,464
Duncans.,S01E13,465
Still can't find them?,S01E13,466
No.,S01E13,467
And I've searched the entire city.,S01E13,468
How was the so insanage done with Gabe,S01E13,469
"You know, when I was coaching we didn't have this problem.",S01E13,470
"Uh-oh, Charlie, look at your tummy.",S01E14,0
I think somebody's had enough pancakes.,S01E14,1
No no.,S01E14,2
"Oh my goodness,",S01E14,3
Somebody loves her blankie.,S01E14,4
Whoo!,S01E14,5
"All right, dad, now pull out your blankie.",S01E14,6
"Sure thing, son,",S01E14,7
Right after I drop you off at a military school.,S01E14,8
"Oh, hey, look what's gonna happen on Saturday.",S01E14,9
"Oh, yeah, the truck from the thrift store is coming.",S01E14,10
And it's your wedding anniversary.,S01E14,11
Right.,S01E14,12
What time is the truck coming?,S01E14,13
So how are you guys gonna celebrate this year?,S01E14,14
There's no better way to celebrate than the tax deduction.,S01E14,15
We're gonna get from donating old clothes.,S01E14,16
"Bob, remember the deduction from our 10th anniversary?",S01E14,17
Ooh!,S01E14,18
"Guys, guys, guys, you know what?",S01E14,19
I think we should do something for mom and dad on their anniversary.,S01E14,20
Don't we do enough for them on mother's and father's day?,S01E14,21
You never do anything for them.,S01E14,22
"Excuse me, I was born, which made them a mother and a father.",S01E14,23
My work is done.,S01E14,24
"Well, I think.",S01E14,25
We should surprise them with a romantic dinner.,S01E14,26
You're gonna make a dinner?,S01E14,27
I think we should surprise them.,S01E14,28
And order a romantic dinner.,S01E14,29
Then we can serve it to them like waiters.,S01E14,30
Why do girl ideas always take so much work?,S01E14,31
I get it.,S01E14,32
"If we do something nice for them,",S01E14,33
They have to do something nice for us.,S01E14,34
Like give us presents.,S01E14,35
Yes.,S01E14,36
Why can't we just do it because we love them?,S01E14,37
Because then we don't get stuff.,S01E14,38
Duh.,S01E14,39
Today's all burnt toast{\i0},S01E14,40
"Running late, and dad jokes{\i0}",S01E14,41
Has anybody seen my left shoe{\i0},S01E14,42
"I close my eyes, take a bite{\i0}",S01E14,43
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud{\i0}",S01E14,44
There it is up on the roof{\i0},S01E14,45
"I've been there, I've survived{\i0}",S01E14,46
So just take my advice{\i0},S01E14,47
"Hang in there, baby{\i0},",S01E14,48
Things are crazy{\i0},S01E14,49
But I know your future is bright{\i0},S01E14,50
"Hang in there, Baby{\i0}",S01E14,51
There is no maybe{\i0},S01E14,52
Eveything turns out all right{\i0},S01E14,53
Sure life is up and down{\i0},S01E14,54
"But trust me, it comes back all around{\i0}",S01E14,55
You're gonna love who you turn out to be{\i0},S01E14,56
"Hang in there, Baby{\i0}",S01E14,57
Hey!,S01E14,58
Shouldn't someone go tell Charlie to shut up?,S01E14,59
You know what? You give it a shot.,S01E14,60
We've been trying all night long.,S01E14,61
And by We He means me.,S01E14,62
"Come on, I got up that one time.",S01E14,63
"And when you flushed, you woke her up.",S01E14,64
But why is she so fussy?,S01E14,65
We can't find her blankie.,S01E14,66
And we've looked everywhere.,S01E14,67
"Oh, that's ridiculous.",S01E14,68
She shouldn't need something to help her sleep.,S01E14,69
What about your stuffed monkey?,S01E14,70
Coco's different.,S01E14,71
"Guys, what a horrible way to spend your anniversary.",S01E14,72
We should really get out of the house.,S01E14,73
Ow. What are you doing?,S01E14,74
Oh.,S01E14,75
"Mom and dad, on your anniversary",S01E14,76
"I'm taking you to lunch and a movie,",S01E14,77
My treat.,S01E14,78
"Oh, dad, bring your wallet.",S01E14,79
"You don't know what My treat Means, do you?",S01E14,80
"Okay, we'd love to go to a movie, kids,",S01E14,81
But not when Charlie's so upset.,S01E14,82
I'll find Charlie's blankie and take care of her.,S01E14,83
Now you two go out and enjoy some alone time.,S01E14,84
On your anniversary.,S01E14,85
With Gabe.,S01E14,86
And I know the perfect movie to see,S01E14,87
Star Exploders II: Ticking Asteroids in 3D.,S01E14,88
"Hey, you know what? The critics hated that.",S01E14,89
That means it's gotta be good.,S01E14,90
"Oh, yeah.",S01E14,91
Or we could see The Willow Weeps Tomorrow.,S01E14,92
What's that about?,S01E14,93
It's a haunting tale of a young girl.,S01E14,94
"Who lives on a farm, plants a willow tree.",S01E14,95
And grows up with dreams of becoming a ballerina.,S01E14,96
And then on the day of the big audition.,S01E14,97
"She twists her ankle, goes back to the farm,",S01E14,98
Gets married and has a baby.,S01E14,99
And do you know what she names it?,S01E14,100
Willow.,S01E14,101
I feel like we just saw it.,S01E14,102
And hated it.,S01E14,103
"Oh, come on, guys.",S01E14,104
It's my anniversary too.,S01E14,105
"No no no, you're absolutely right.",S01E14,106
"Look, we don't have to figure this out now.",S01E14,107
We'll decide when we get to the theater.,S01E14,108
Okay.,S01E14,109
Okay.,S01E14,110
Star Exploders!,S01E14,111
"Charlie, I'm looking for your blankie.",S01E14,112
Please stop crying.,S01E14,113
"Oh, look, it's your favorite show",S01E14,114
The circles.,S01E14,115
They're the colorful singing shapes.,S01E14,116
That teach you about shapes.,S01E14,117
"I am a red circle, yes, I am",S01E14,118
I am big and round and red.,S01E14,119
Hey!,S01E14,120
"Man, this is annoying.",S01E14,121
"Oh, what's this I found? Is this your blankie?",S01E14,122
I'll take that as a no.,S01E14,123
Let's take you on a walk.,S01E14,124
That'll make you feel better.,S01E14,125
Yay!,S01E14,126
Excuse me.,S01E14,127
Excuse me.,S01E14,128
"Great, I think I'm the only woman in here.",S01E14,129
"Hey, what about?",S01E14,130
Nope.,S01E14,131
I'm kind of getting hungry.,S01E14,132
"Yeah, you know what? Let's eat.",S01E14,133
Pass this to your dad.,S01E14,134
Isn't this great,S01E14,135
Not having to buy that movie theater food?,S01E14,136
We're saving so much money.,S01E14,137
I guess I had a different picture in my mind.,S01E14,138
When Gabe said Lunch and a movie.,S01E14,139
I think he said Lunch in a movie.,S01E14,140
"Mom, do you have my milkshake?",S01E14,141
Oh.,S01E14,142
You know what? I think it's easier.,S01E14,143
If you just stick the straw in.,S01E14,144
"Hey, the movie's starting.",S01E14,145
Really?,S01E14,146
"Excuse me, could you take off your tentacles?",S01E14,147
Got the cake.,S01E14,148
Whoa. What's all this about?,S01E14,149
"Oh, it's the theme for tonight's dinner.",S01E14,150
I turned the living room into a moroccan palace.,S01E14,151
So we'll be serving moroccan food?,S01E14,152
Won't that make dad gassy?,S01E14,153
Name a country that won't make dad gassy.,S01E14,154
Good point.,S01E14,155
Are you still looking for Charlie's blankie?,S01E14,156
I can't find it anywhere.,S01E14,157
I thought I put it in that pile of dirty clothes.,S01E14,158
We have a dirty clothes pile?,S01E14,159
"Yeah, it's where your clothes magically go.",S01E14,160
After you throw them on the floor.,S01E14,161
I hope you didn't put it on the donation pile.,S01E14,162
"For the thrift store, cause that is long gone.",S01E14,163
We gave her blankie away?,S01E14,164
You gave her blankie away.,S01E14,165
We have to get it back.,S01E14,166
You have to get it back.,S01E14,167
Stop saying that.,S01E14,168
You stop saying that.,S01E14,169
"You know, I'm usually the one who messes things up.",S01E14,170
But this time everything on my side of the operation.,S01E14,171
Is going just fine. See?,S01E14,172
"Bon voyage, Esther & Marty?",S01E14,173
Oops.,S01E14,174
You brought home the wrong cake.,S01E14,175
Can't we just tell mom and dad.,S01E14,176
That Bon voyage Is french for Happy anniversary?,S01E14,177
What about Esther & Marty?,S01E14,178
Who cares about them? They're on a ship.,S01E14,179
"Okay, we still have time before mom and dad get home.",S01E14,180
We can fix this.,S01E14,181
How?,S01E14,182
You drop me off at the thrift store.,S01E14,183
I'll grab the blankie while you go switch cakes.,S01E14,184
Let's do it.,S01E14,185
Let's do it with Charlie.,S01E14,186
Oh!,S01E14,187
Yeah!,S01E14,188
That was awesome.,S01E14,189
And derivative.,S01E14,190
They did it in Solar Troopers: Star Quest IV.,S01E14,191
How many stars have to explode before this thing is over?,S01E14,192
"10, 365,",S01E14,193
Or so they said in the chat room.,S01E14,194
"Hey, mom, could you jiggle your purse?",S01E14,195
My shake's clogging.,S01E14,196
"Honey, put your phone away.",S01E14,197
It's distracting.,S01E14,198
My phone is distracting from the 3d destruction of the milky way?,S01E14,199
Do you mind?,S01E14,200
You were talking too.,S01E14,201
"About the movie, which is totally allowed.",S01E14,202
"Oh, yeah?",S01E14,203
"Honey, honey, where are you going?",S01E14,204
Out.,S01E14,205
"Excuse me, could you move your flipper?",S01E14,206
I should go talk to her.,S01E14,207
"Mr. President,",S01E14,208
Only you can give the order to explode the supernova.,S01E14,209
May the galaxy forgive me.,S01E14,210
Whoo!,S01E14,211
"Excuse me, excuse me.",S01E14,212
"Hi, I donated something and I have to get it back.",S01E14,213
"Oh, dear.",S01E14,214
Someone doesn't know what the word Donation Means.,S01E14,215
"See, darling, when you donate something, you do not get it back.",S01E14,216
You don't understand how important this is.,S01E14,217
I accidentally gave away my baby sister's blankie.,S01E14,218
Your baby sister's blankie?!,S01E14,219
I still don't care.,S01E14,220
Did someone wake up on the wrong side of the bed?,S01E14,221
I sleep on the futon.,S01E14,222
Mama gets the bed.,S01E14,223
Can you help me?,S01E14,224
I'm afraid it's out of my hands.,S01E14,225
Everything that was donated this week is already on that truck.,S01E14,226
Leslie's dog-washing service.,S01E14,227
"If your pooch is dirty, I'll make him purty.",S01E14,228
Side business.,S01E14,229
I'm also a life coach.,S01E14,230
"Yeah, uh-huh.",S01E14,231
"Oh, I think I see it.",S01E14,232
"No, ma'am, we don't wash cats.",S01E14,233
Cats wash themselves.,S01E14,234
Uh-oh.,S01E14,235
"Wait, no.",S01E14,236
"Hold it, no.",S01E14,237
Boop boop boop!,S01E14,238
"This is zaalouk, couscous,",S01E14,239
"Tajine, pastilla and harira.",S01E14,240
Any questions?,S01E14,241
"Actually, I do have a question. Is your name really Aziz?",S01E14,242
It is on saturdays between 5:00 and 9:00.,S01E14,243
Tuesdays and thursdays I'm Raoul from El Gaucho.,S01E14,244
"Oh, cool.",S01E14,245
I'm also in the food delivery business.,S01E14,246
I work for Kwikki Chikki.,S01E14,247
You mean the guys who wear the rooster hat.,S01E14,248
With the cartoon beak?,S01E14,249
"Where's your pride, man?",S01E14,250
Gotta answer the phone.,S01E14,251
Hello.,S01E14,252
PJ,S01E14,253
"Teddy, what happened to you?",S01E14,254
I went to the thrift store and you weren't there.,S01E14,255
I'm locked in the back of a truck.,S01E14,256
"Ooh, this is cute.",S01E14,257
Someone threw this out?,S01E14,258
"What? Teddy, I can't hear you.",S01E14,259
Try going outside to get better reception.,S01E14,260
"If I could go outside, I wouldn't have to call you.",S01E14,261
"Okay, I have an idea why don't I go outside?",S01E14,262
Can I hear you now?,S01E14,263
I'm locked in the back of a truck.,S01E14,264
Locked in the back of a truck?,S01E14,265
"Teddy, how could you be so stupid?",S01E14,266
"Um, forget that question.",S01E14,267
I gotta go.,S01E14,268
"Wait, no.",S01E14,269
"Wait, no.",S01E14,270
"Um, yeah.",S01E14,271
"Charlie, hi.",S01E14,272
Can you open the door for me?,S01E14,273
"Charlie, come here. Charlie, where are you going?",S01E14,274
"Charlie, Charlie.",S01E14,275
"Charlie, can you come here?",S01E14,276
Thattagirl.,S01E14,277
A little closer.,S01E14,278
A little closer.,S01E14,279
"Charlie, no.",S01E14,280
"No, not the food.",S01E14,281
"Charlie, please.",S01E14,282
Please come here.,S01E14,283
"Charlie, Charlie, hi, hi.",S01E14,284
Come here.,S01E14,285
Come here.,S01E14,286
"Yes, thattagirl.",S01E14,287
Thattagirl.,S01E14,288
A little closer.,S01E14,289
A little closer.,S01E14,290
Ugh.,S01E14,291
"You can do that, but you can't open the door?",S01E14,292
"Hey, honey, you're missing the whole movie.",S01E14,293
"Yeah, that's kind of the idea.",S01E14,294
What are you doing out here?,S01E14,295
The guy with the tentacles cut the cheese.,S01E14,296
"Yeah, it was the guy with the tentacles.",S01E14,297
"Honey, what's wrong?",S01E14,298
I don't know.,S01E14,299
I guess the truth is it would be nice to do more on our anniversary.,S01E14,300
We used to do special things.,S01E14,301
Now we're eating onion rings out of my purse.,S01E14,302
There were onion rings?,S01E14,303
But I thought we agreed,S01E14,304
we weren't gonna do anything special.,S01E14,305
"Yeah, I know.",S01E14,306
I know we did.,S01E14,307
So now you want to do special things?,S01E14,308
"Well, it's better than doing unspecial things,",S01E14,309
Like sitting in a theater full of 40-year-old nerds.,S01E14,310
"Hey, I'm only 36.",S01E14,311
"Okay, you know what?",S01E14,312
You guys go back and enjoy your movie.,S01E14,313
And I'm gonna go see The Willow Weeps Tomorrow.,S01E14,314
"No, honey, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.",S01E14,315
Are you gonna want the onion rings or?,S01E14,316
Here you go.,S01E14,317
Happy anniversary.,S01E14,318
I don't think I handled that very well.,S01E14,319
Ya think?,S01E14,320
"Oh, man.",S01E14,321
I should have planned something.,S01E14,322
"Well, maybe you did.",S01E14,323
What do you mean?,S01E14,324
"Well, Teddy, p.",S01E14,325
J.,S01E14,326
And I are surprising you guys.,S01E14,327
With an anniversary dinner.,S01E14,328
"It was all my idea, not Teddy's.",S01E14,329
But I can let you take the credit.,S01E14,330
Are you serious? You'd do that for me?,S01E14,331
Sure.,S01E14,332
Just remember me on Gabe's day.,S01E14,333
What's Gabe's day?,S01E14,334
Surprise me.,S01E14,335
Agh! An arm!,S01E14,336
"My goodness, people will donate anything.",S01E14,337
A little help here.,S01E14,338
What are you doing in the back of my truck?,S01E14,339
"Looking for my sister's blankie. And it's not in here,",S01E14,340
"Although I did find this really cute top, see?",S01E14,341
You know what would look good with that?,S01E14,342
Get out of my truck!,S01E14,343
But I don't even know where I am.,S01E14,344
You're in the driveway of my house.,S01E14,345
Mama always likes first dibs on my pile.,S01E14,346
"Wait, and you still have to sleep on the futon?",S01E14,347
That just doesn't seem right.,S01E14,348
Would you mind telling that to my mama?,S01E14,349
"Charlie, please open the door.",S01E14,350
Open window.,S01E14,351
"Ha ha! Coming, Charlie.",S01E14,352
This is so sad.,S01E14,353
I know.,S01E14,354
"First she loses her man,",S01E14,355
And now her sense of smell.,S01E14,356
Her problem is she loves too much.,S01E14,357
I smell Oscar.,S01E14,358
But she won't.,S01E14,359
What are you doing here?,S01E14,360
I was worried about you.,S01E14,361
And our movie ended.,S01E14,362
Ow!,S01E14,363
"Look, honey, I wasn't gonna tell you this,",S01E14,364
But I've got an anniversary surprise waiting for you at home.,S01E14,365
Really? What is it?,S01E14,366
"If I told you, it wouldn't be much of a surprise now, would it?",S01E14,367
Oh.,S01E14,368
I love you.,S01E14,369
Thanks for staying and watching the rest of the movie with me.,S01E14,370
Oh.,S01E14,371
Okay.,S01E14,372
Why do I have to stay?,S01E14,373
"Because if you don't, Gabe's day is canceled.",S01E14,374
What are you doing here?,S01E14,375
I have a heart as well as a brain.,S01E14,376
I'm not a robot.,S01E14,377
I wish I was.,S01E14,378
"Hey, dad, do you want to switch seats?",S01E14,379
So then I left Broadway.,S01E14,380
I've never looked back.,S01E14,381
I can't believe I didn't find Charlie's blankie.,S01E14,382
I could have sworn,S01E14,383
I looked at every single thing in that truck.,S01E14,384
Were you even listening to my life's story?,S01E14,385
Does the name Patti lupone mean nothing to you?,S01E14,386
"I'm sorry, I just",S01E14,387
What are you sitting on?,S01E14,388
Just a little blanket.,S01E14,389
"No, that's Charlie's blankie. Give me that!",S01E14,390
"Oh, there.",S01E14,391
Why were you sitting on it?,S01E14,392
How shall I put this?,S01E14,393
I have a medical condition known as posterial hydrosis.,S01E14,394
What's that?,S01E14,395
Butt sweats.,S01E14,396
Eww.,S01E14,397
"Well, at least I got it back.",S01E14,398
Stop the truck.,S01E14,399
Back it up.,S01E14,400
Boop boop boop!,S01E14,401
"Okay, look, before we go in I just want to say something.",S01E14,402
"Now I know I'm not always the most romantic guy,",S01E14,403
"But I should be, because you deserve it.",S01E14,404
Happy anniversary!,S01E14,405
Surprise!,S01E14,406
"Oh, Charlie.",S01E14,407
What happened?,S01E14,408
Ask dad.,S01E14,409
He planned the whole thing.,S01E14,410
For your anniversary we'd like to serve you,S01E14,411
a traditional moroccan feast.,S01E14,412
"But since that ended up on the floor,",S01E14,413
we bring you,S01E14,414
Peanut butter toast.,S01E14,415
This is so sweet of you kids.,S01E14,416
"You know, I think this turned out to be",S01E14,417
a pretty great anniversary after all.,S01E14,418
I don't even mind that I'm sitting in couscous.,S01E14,419
And now it's time for the entertainment.,S01E14,420
"Ladies and gentlemen, may I present to you",S01E14,421
The dancing Duncans!,S01E14,422
Isn't it amazing how a little piece of cloth,S01E14,423
"can make someone so happy,",S01E14,424
Even when it's covered in tire tracks and butt sweat?,S01E14,425
I'm gonna wash it after you fall asleep.,S01E14,426
"But it's so funny, because we love our blankies so much,",S01E14,427
And then one day we forget all about them.,S01E14,428
"And if you're like me,",S01E14,429
you'll grow out of yours by the time you're five.,S01E14,430
Good night.,S01E14,431
"But if you're like Gabe,",S01E14,432
You might bring it on your honeymoon.,S01E14,433
"Good luck, Charlie.",S01E14,434
"Hey, you know what? I'm kind of hungry.",S01E14,435
Pass this your dad.,S01E14,436
Anything else?,S01E14,437
I had chicken yesterday. Got anything else?,S01E14,438
"What, no fixings?",S01E14,439
Hold on.,S01E14,440
"Hey, honey, aren't you gonna have something?",S01E14,441
"Oh, I almost forgot.",S01E14,442
"Okay,",S01E14,443
Who ordered nachos?,S01E14,444
That would be me.,S01E14,445
Shh.,S01E14,446
Today's all burnt toast{\i0},S01E15,0
"Running late, and dad jokes{\i0}",S01E15,1
Has anybody seen my left shoe{\i0},S01E15,2
"I close my eyes, take a bite{\i0}",S01E15,3
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud{\i0}",S01E15,4
There it is up on the roof{\i0},S01E15,5
"I've been there, I've survived{\i0}",S01E15,6
So just take my advice{\i0},S01E15,7
"Hang in there, baby,{\i0}",S01E15,8
Things are crazy{\i0},S01E15,9
But I know your future is bright{\i0},S01E15,10
"Hang in there, Baby{\i0}",S01E15,11
There is no maybe{\i0},S01E15,12
Eveything turns out all right{\i0},S01E15,13
Sure life is up and down{\i0},S01E15,14

You're gonna love who you turn out to be{\i0},S01E15,16
"Hang in there, Baby{\i0}",S01E15,17
"Hey, you guys want to see something funny?",S01E15,18
"Oh, if this is where you lift your shirt up.",S01E15,19
"And make your belly button sing no, thank you.",S01E15,20
Even better.,S01E15,21
Check out this video I made of Charlie.,S01E15,22
Being a baby stinks.,S01E15,23
"Food's too mushy, gross and too juicy,",S01E15,24
And the tv shows they make me watch are insulting.,S01E15,25
"Ahh, much better.",S01E15,26
Life is good.,S01E15,27
P.,S01E15,28
J.,S01E15,29
", you are gonna have to put that online so grandma can see it.",S01E15,30
Grandma knows how to go online?,S01E15,31
P.,S01E15,32
J.,S01E15,33
", you're gonna have to put that on a DVD.",S01E15,34
So grandma can watch it.,S01E15,35
Grandma got a DVD. Player?,S01E15,36
"Okay, P.",S01E15,37
J.,S01E15,38
", you're just gonna have to go over to grandma's house.",S01E15,39
And act it out for her.,S01E15,40
"Okay, where is the library?",S01E15,41
Donde esta la libraria?,S01E15,42
"Okay, you're really cute when you roll your rs,",S01E15,43
But it's Biblioteca.,S01E15,44
Biblioteca.,S01E15,45
But say Libraria Again.,S01E15,46
Libraria.,S01E15,47
Your rrrs make me all Mmm.,S01E15,48
"Hey, listen, I want to ask you something.",S01E15,49

Well,S01E15,51
"Gabe, do you mind?",S01E15,52
"No, you can stay.",S01E15,53
Let's go upstairs.,S01E15,54
"Good idea. I was gonna say something,",S01E15,55
But I didn't want to be rude.,S01E15,56
"Okay, now what did you want to ask me?",S01E15,57
I was wondering if,S01E15,58
It was embarrassing.,S01E15,59
It was a simple question.,S01E15,60
"Your father shouts at me from two aisles away,",S01E15,61
"Hey, ames, what kind of toilet paper you like",S01E15,62
Quilted or super-quilted?,S01E15,63
"Hey, look, Spencer's here.",S01E15,64
"So what, the world doesn't know.",S01E15,65
That the great Amy Duncan uses toilet paper?,S01E15,66
"Nice to see you, Mr.",S01E15,67
And Mrs.,S01E15,68
Duncan.,S01E15,69
"After all that shouting, you got the wrong kind.",S01E15,70
"Well, that's because I'm not Bob the toilet paper psychic.",S01E15,71
Right this way.,S01E15,72
"Well, on the bright side,",S01E15,73
You got the wrong trash bags too.,S01E15,74
Sorry about my parents.,S01E15,75
"Wow, I say that a lot.",S01E15,76
So what I wanted to ask you was,S01E15,77
I'm gonna get you! I'm gonna get you!,S01E15,78
"Yes, I am.",S01E15,79
"Yes, I am.",S01E15,80
"Yes, I am.",S01E15,81
"Okay, let's go outside.",S01E15,82
It usually takes him a while to get her.,S01E15,83
"Okay, I think I'm all out of family members,",S01E15,84
But you'd better talk fast.,S01E15,85
"Okay, I was wondering.",S01E15,86
If you would wear my football Jersey on Friday.,S01E15,87
It's sort of a tradition that the players' girlfriends.,S01E15,88
Wear their jerseys on game day.,S01E15,89
So that would make me.,S01E15,90
Your girlfriend?,S01E15,91
Yeah.,S01E15,92
Cool,S01E15,93
Because I wasn't exactly sure of our status.,S01E15,94
And I was too nervous to ask.,S01E15,95
And I didn't want to be one of those girls.,S01E15,96
That made you talk about it. But then again,S01E15,97
So that's a yes on the Jersey?,S01E15,98
"Of course it's a yes, boyfriend.",S01E15,99
"Back to the store,",S01E15,100
Where the correct answer was super-quilted!,S01E15,101
"Whoa, this is amazing.",S01E15,102
That Charlie video has gone viral.,S01E15,103
What does that mean?,S01E15,104
That it's gotten a million hits since last Tuesday.,S01E15,105
And now I'll answer your next question.,S01E15,106
That means over a million people have seen it.,S01E15,107
"So what, you put that on the FaceTube?",S01E15,108
"Yeah, that's right, dad the FaceTube.",S01E15,109
I'm gonna be on tv.,S01E15,110
What?,S01E15,111
The Channel 8 News just called.,S01E15,112
"And now that this video is allver the Internet,",S01E15,113
They want to do an exclusive on the Farty Charlie family.,S01E15,114
So we're all gonna be on tv,S01E15,115
That's what I meant.,S01E15,116
And this is our family room.,S01E15,117
Your family what?,S01E15,118
Our family rrroom.,S01E15,119
"Oh, it's so nice and peaceful here.",S01E15,120
"Well, it's a big house and it's just me, mom and dad.",S01E15,121
"Oh, how wonderful.",S01E15,122
"Mom, dad, this is Teddy.",S01E15,123

"Oh, please, I'm Linda.",S01E15,127
This is Paul.,S01E15,128
Spencer has told us so much about you.,S01E15,129
You're even prettier than he said.,S01E15,130
"Dad, stop.",S01E15,131
"Oh, no, it's okay.",S01E15,132
I don't mind being pretty.,S01E15,133
"Oh, Spence, before I forget,",S01E15,134
Your mom did the cutest thing in the store today.,S01E15,135
She pointed out an eggplant in the shape of a heart.,S01E15,136
And said it remded her of me.,S01E15,137
"Well, it did.",S01E15,138
They must shop at a different store than my parents.,S01E15,139
"Well, let me put these away and I'll fix you kids a quick snack.",S01E15,140
"Oh, that's a beautiful guitar.",S01E15,141
"Oh, thank you.",S01E15,142
I picked this up on our last trip to Spain.,S01E15,143
Do you mind if I play?,S01E15,144
"No, go ahead.",S01E15,145
"Yeah, my brother he plays guitar and he",S01E15,146
Sounds nothing like that.,S01E15,147
"Oh, that is so pretty.",S01E15,148
Thank you.,S01E15,149
"Teddy, have a seat, relax.",S01E15,150
Okay.,S01E15,151
"Oh, massage chair.",S01E15,152
Ni-I-I-ce.,S01E15,153
Smoked salmon and dill on toast points.,S01E15,154
That's a snack?,S01E15,155
I dabble in the culinary arts.,S01E15,156
"Mm, you more than dabble in that.",S01E15,157
"Oh wait, can I have one more?",S01E15,158
You want to start studying?,S01E15,159
In a mi-I-inute.,S01E15,160
"Well, I'm not surprised. Once you're on top,",S01E15,161
They just want to knock you down.,S01E15,162
What are you talking about?,S01E15,163
Listen to some of these comments about the Charlie video.,S01E15,164
"Fred r5178 says,",S01E15,165
"Cute, but you got lucky, one-hit wonder.",S01E15,166
"Here's another one You're a pathetic, no-talent loser!",S01E15,167
With about 19 exclamation points.,S01E15,168
That one's from GabeD.,S01E15,169
Who are these people?,S01E15,170
There's no way to know.,S01E15,171
"Gabe honey, come here.",S01E15,172
I want to show you something very exciting from mommy's past.,S01E15,173
"Teddy told me if I ever heard those words,",S01E15,174
I should just keep walking.,S01E15,175
Park it.,S01E15,176
Now in preparation for our television appearance,S01E15,177
I'm studying some of my previous broadcast work.,S01E15,178
I used to be a reporter.,S01E15,179
For the southwest Denver community college action news team.,S01E15,180
We reached dozens of viewers all across the country.,S01E15,181
This is one of my hardest-hitting pieces.,S01E15,182
In my hand I'm holding.,S01E15,183
Something new to our campus,S01E15,184
A cell phone.,S01E15,185
Cell Is short for Cellular,S01E15,186
"Believe it or not,",S01E15,187
You can use this phone wherever you go.,S01E15,188
"I know it sounds crazy,",S01E15,189
"But as Paula abdul would say,",S01E15,190
I'm tellin' ya straight up.,S01E15,191

The commercial with the talking foot.,S01E15,202

"Ooh, what are you having?",S01E15,210
Toast points with salmon and dill.,S01E15,211
Toast points? I say what's-the-points.,S01E15,212
"Hey, check out Charlie.",S01E15,213
She put sloppy Joe on her face.,S01E15,214
Because she's a baby. What's so funny?,S01E15,215
It's not just funny cause she's a baby.,S01E15,216
"See, this works on all ages.",S01E15,217
"Now Gabe, you know that's not right.",S01E15,218
"Yeah, it should be more like this.",S01E15,219
"Okay, all right, all right, cut it out.",S01E15,220
Next person who throws sloppy Joe,S01E15,221
"Guys, you know, at Spencer's house.",S01E15,222
The food goes directly from their plates to their mouths.,S01E15,223
How is that fun?,S01E15,224
I'll let you know tomorrow night,S01E15,225
because I'm going over there for dinner.,S01E15,226
His mom is making quail.,S01E15,227
Not sloppy quail quail.,S01E15,228
You can't go over there tomorrow night.,S01E15,229
The channel 8 news crew is coming over.,S01E15,230
They're gonna interview the whole family.,S01E15,231
"Yeah, I think I'll pass.",S01E15,232
"What, you don't want to be on tv with me?",S01E15,233
Us.,S01E15,234

"No, I don't want to be a part of the Farty charlie Family.",S01E15,236
It's embarrassing.,S01E15,237
It's embarrassing.,S01E15,238
Or we're embarrassing?,S01E15,239
Yes.,S01E15,240

Yep.,S01E15,242
Nobody calls P.,S01E15,243
J.,S01E15,244
Duncan a one-hit wonder.,S01E15,245
Behold Farty Charlie II.,S01E15,246
"Hey, I'm Charlie.",S01E15,247
I'm feeling extra gassy today.,S01E15,248
"Uh-oh, here comes.",S01E15,249
"Ahh, that's better.",S01E15,250
So what do you think?,S01E15,251
Where do I begin?,S01E15,252
That wasn't even Charlie.,S01E15,253
That was a doll.,S01E15,254
Because Charlie had to take a nap.,S01E15,255
"Plus, you can only tell cause you're her brother.",S01E15,256
"No, I could tell because her foot was facing the wrong direction.",S01E15,257
"Well, did you like anything about it?",S01E15,258
"Well, I liked",S01E15,259
No.,S01E15,260
"Man, the people are right.",S01E15,261
I am a one-hit wonder.,S01E15,262
"Look, you had a good run.",S01E15,263
30 seconds?,S01E15,264
"Look, I'm trying to put lipstick on a pig here.",S01E15,265
You're a failure.,S01E15,266
Lipstick on a pig that's hilarious.,S01E15,267
I just got an idea for my next film.,S01E15,268
"If anyone needs me,",S01E15,269
"I'll be at the drugstore, then the zoo.",S01E15,270
"Oh, honey, it's Teddy. Where's Spence?",S01E15,271
"Oh, he won't be back for a couple of hours.",S01E15,272
"Oh, am I early?",S01E15,273
Did I accidentally come here too early.,S01E15,274
By mistake somehow?,S01E15,275
It's fine.,S01E15,276
Because I could wait outside.,S01E15,277
"Oh, don't be silly.",S01E15,278
"Go on, have a seat.",S01E15,279
Make yourself at home.,S01E15,280
"Oh, does that one vibrate too?",S01E15,281
"No, just that one.",S01E15,282
Oh,S01E15,283
Would you prefer that one?,S01E15,284
"Hey, there's an idea.",S01E15,285
"So how are you, dear?",S01E15,286
"Well, now that you ask,",S01E15,287
I'm a little snacky.,S01E15,288

"Listen, I've got a lot of exciting new projects coming up,",S01E15,294
"So if you could mention the words Pig Or Lipstick,",S01E15,295
You might get yourself an exclusive.,S01E15,296
"Hi, this is Charlie.",S01E15,297
I'm Bob.,S01E15,298
Of Bob's bugs be gone.,S01E15,299
Yeah. You've seen my trucks around town?,S01E15,300
And the big bug on your shirt.,S01E15,301
"Oh, didn't even realize I was wearing this.",S01E15,302
Or that she's wearing the exact same shirt.,S01E15,303
"Hey, what do you know?",S01E15,304
"Hi, everybody.",S01E15,305
"I'm Amy, Charlie's mom.",S01E15,306
And former anchor for Good Morning Campus Today.,S01E15,307
"Listen, if you run into any problems.",S01E15,308
"During your segment, just throw it to me.",S01E15,309
I'll be your go-to gal.,S01E15,310
"Honey, have you rehearsed what you're gonna say about your business?",S01E15,311
Rehearsed? I'm just gonna wing it.,S01E15,312
"No no, Bob, you're not very good at winging it.",S01E15,313
Remember your wedding vows?,S01E15,314
I like her.,S01E15,315
"Honey, I was a little nervous.",S01E15,316
And that was a long time ago.,S01E15,317
I'm gonna be fine.,S01E15,318
"Hey, mom, you have something on your face.",S01E15,319
"Oh, where?",S01E15,320
Everywhere.,S01E15,321
"Honey, you need to wear a lot of makeup on television.",S01E15,322
So that you're not washed out under all the lights.,S01E15,323
The kids don't know this because they're not in the media arts.,S01E15,324
I don't know how long it's been.,S01E15,325
"Since you've been in the media arts,",S01E15,326
But with hi-def you don't need a lot of light.,S01E15,327
"Oh, well, how will my makeup look in hi-def?",S01E15,328
Should be interesting.,S01E15,329
"Okay, let's do this.",S01E15,330
"This is Rick Coleman,",S01E15,331
And I'm here with Denver's newest celebrity.,S01E15,332
"Who's been seen by, well, pretty much everyone with a computer.",S01E15,333
She's cute.,S01E15,334
She's funny.,S01E15,335
She's farty Charlie!,S01E15,336
"Back to you, Rick.",S01E15,337
And here we are on our family reunion last summer in Aspen.,S01E15,338
You were staying in a lodge?,S01E15,339
"No, that's our cabin.",S01E15,340
Our lodge is on the other side of our mountain.,S01E15,341
"Dad, stop.",S01E15,342
You're making us sound like we're rich.,S01E15,343
We don't have our own mountain.,S01E15,344
We share it with another family.,S01E15,345
"Speaking of families, Teddy, when are we gonna get to meet yours?",S01E15,346
"Uh, they're kind of busy,",S01E15,347
So maybe next summer.,S01E15,348
Or the one after that.,S01E15,349
"Okay, everyone, I have the news on in the kitchen.",S01E15,350
You have got to see these people.,S01E15,351
"And when they saw what great work I was doing out in the field,",S01E15,352
"they said, Hey, we need her on good morning campus today.'",S01E15,353
"Rick, you might say.",S01E15,354
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.,S01E15,355
If we could get back to Charlie,S01E15,356
Why don't we talk to the proud papa?,S01E15,357
Whew.,S01E15,358
"Whoa, look, dad, you're sweating right through your shirt.",S01E15,359
Uh,S01E15,360
"You know, Rick,",S01E15,361
Something I find very interesting.,S01E15,362
Is that cell phones have gotten so much smaller.,S01E15,363
"Back to you, Rick.",S01E15,364
"So, PJ, you're the director of this little epic.",S01E15,365
"That's right, rick director, writer, editor and voice.",S01E15,366
"I don't know what a producer does,",S01E15,367
But I probably did that too.,S01E15,368
What are you doing?,S01E15,369
"Well, you just give it to me and I'll throw it back to you.",S01E15,370
"No, we're done.",S01E15,371
At least let me throw it back to Yolanda in the studio.,S01E15,372
"No, I do that.",S01E15,373
Back to Yolanda in the studio.,S01E15,374
What is wrong with you people?,S01E15,375
I thought you'd enjoy that.,S01E15,376
You have no idea.,S01E15,377
What a family. The woman,S01E15,378
She looks like a circus clown.,S01E15,379
Clowns are fun.,S01E15,380
What about the big sweaty oaf? He was a piece of work.,S01E15,381
Oafs are fun.,S01E15,382
Where did they find these people?,S01E15,383
"Mom, dad, stop, okay? That's Teddy's family.",S01E15,384
"That's a good one, Spence.",S01E15,385
"No, he's not kidding.",S01E15,386
"Oh, but Teddy, you're nothing like those people.",S01E15,387
You're so poised and sophisticated and,S01E15,388
Excuse me?,S01E15,389
I said,S01E15,390
I can do that because I'm a Duncan.,S01E15,391
I'm the product of the sweaty oaf and the crazy clown.,S01E15,392
"Oh Teddy, I'm sorry.",S01E15,393
We didn't know.,S01E15,394
"Oh, no no, it's okay.",S01E15,395
Yesterday I was embarrassed by them too.,S01E15,396
And I even told them that.,S01E15,397
And then I came over here.,S01E15,398
So I could pretend that I was one of you.,S01E15,399
But I'm not.,S01E15,400
I'm one of them.,S01E15,401
"I sweat, I fart and I burp.",S01E15,402
"You're not gonna do that again, are you?",S01E15,403
No.,S01E15,404
"In fact, I should probably get back to my family.",S01E15,405
"In this, their darkest hour.",S01E15,406
Paul.,S01E15,407
"Oh, I'm sorry, dear.",S01E15,408
I just wanted to see how the other half lives.,S01E15,409
Oh.,S01E15,410
"Oh, man.",S01E15,411
"Hey, Charlie, so everyone except for me was on the news tonight,",S01E15,412
And now they're all watching it on the Internet.,S01E15,413
That's right the Duncans have gone viral.,S01E15,414
Oh my gosh I look like a clown.,S01E15,415
"Well, at least you talked.",S01E15,416
And talked and talked,S01E15,417
Hey.,S01E15,418
I look cool.,S01E15,419
"See, that's the great thing about this family",S01E15,420
We can laugh at ourselves.,S01E15,421
And hopefully you feel the same way.,S01E15,422
When you're older and realize,S01E15,423
Everyone in the world has seen me pass gas.,S01E15,424
I'll get it.,S01E15,425
Hi,S01E15,426
Hey,S01E15,427
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.,S01E15,428
"Yeah, I'm fine.",S01E15,429
I'm so sorry about my parents.,S01E15,430
"Wow, it is really nice to hear that coming out of somebody else's mouth.",S01E15,431
I was thinking maybe tomorrow we could study here.,S01E15,432
It's a lot more fun than my house.,S01E15,433
Really? Or are you just saying that to be nice?,S01E15,434
"No, I mean it.",S01E15,435
It's always so quiet at my house.,S01E15,436
Over here it's loud and fun.,S01E15,437
And full of different smells.,S01E15,438
"Okay, my house it is.",S01E15,439
Any chance of a sloppy Joe night?,S01E15,440
"Oh, it'll be a sloppy something night.",S01E15,441
I'll see you tomorrow.,S01E15,442
"Oh hey, hold on a sec.",S01E15,443
"Hey, Charlie, this is my boyfriend Spencer.",S01E15,444
"Hi, Charlie.",S01E15,445
Isn't he cute?,S01E15,446
"I hope someday you find somebody as great as him,",S01E15,447
But it might be tough.,S01E15,448
"So good luck, Charlie.",S01E15,449
"Uh, nuh-uh.",S01E15,450
"Oh, father, that was lovely.",S01E15,451
Your finger-picking is so delicate.,S01E15,452
Almost as delicate as that pomegranate.,S01E15,453
"That you're painting, dear.",S01E15,454
Dinner in 15 minutes.,S01E15,455
Tonight we're having coq au vin and white asparagus.,S01E15,456
"Oh my, I still have on my afternoon pearls.",S01E15,457
"Mother, the table is set.",S01E15,458
How else may I help you?,S01E15,459
"Father, the horses have been groomed and fed.",S01E15,460
It would seem our child is full of beans.,S01E15,461
"Father, how you make us titter.",S01E15,462
So we need an act for the talent show.,S01E16,0

"Hey, guys.",S01E16,8
"We're just passing through, so don't mind us.",S01E16,9
"Oh, I never mind seeing you, Teddy.",S01E16,10

Because spencer and I are doing a dance act together.,S01E16,19
Still wasting your time with spencer?,S01E16,20
"Take away his good looks, his height and his talent, and what have you got?",S01E16,21
You.,S01E16,22
I think we're done here.,S01E16,23
"Man, I would love to beat that spencer.",S01E16,24
"Yeah, we've got to come up with something good.",S01E16,25
"For the talent show, man.",S01E16,26
I got it.,S01E16,27
We go old school and do a ventriloquist act.,S01E16,28
"Oh, a ventriloquist is a guy with a talking puppet, right?",S01E16,29
"Right, a dummy.",S01E16,30
"Oh, one small problemthere's two of us.",S01E16,31
Although.,S01E16,32
One of us could be the dummy.,S01E16,33

I'm just gonna tell you it looks stupid.,S01E16,57
To ahead and vote for dylan.,S01E16,58
I can't vote for dylan.,S01E16,59
He's an ear-picker.,S01E16,60
At least he's given his nose a break.,S01E16,61
"You know, Gabe, you're gonna need the girl vote to win,",S01E16,62
"Which, lucky for you, I can deliver.",S01E16,63
"- How would you do that?- We shoot a campaign video,",S01E16,64
Post it on the class website.,S01E16,65
And we'll put your baby sister in it.,S01E16,66
Girls go nuts over babies.,S01E16,67
"I don't get it, but they do.",S01E16,68
Why do you want to help me? I thought we were enemies.,S01E16,69
"Gabe, let's not put labels on our relationship.",S01E16,70
We both know it's complicated.,S01E16,71
No kidding.,S01E16,72
I had this dream last week where you,S01E16,73
"Yeah, it's complicated.",S01E16,74
"Okay, probably something like this.",S01E16,75
Got it.,S01E16,76
Cool.,S01E16,77
Now you do it.,S01E16,78
Okay.,S01E16,79
So?,S01E16,80
"Really good,",S01E16,81
But you're not doing what I showed you.,S01E16,82
"I know. I feel like it needs something more, right?",S01E16,83
Or less.,S01E16,84
"Actually I've been working on some moves of my own, so",S01E16,85
I call this one the hacky sack.,S01E16,86
Hacky hacky.,S01E16,87
Hacky hacky hacky hacky hacky sack!,S01E16,88
What do you think?,S01E16,89

So act strong.,S01E16,100
How does that look?,S01E16,101
What am I looking at?,S01E16,102
"Just make a fist and say,I will fight for you.",S01E16,103
Okay.,S01E16,104
I will fight for you!,S01E16,105
Perfect. Now let's see the softer side of Gabe,S01E16,106
The loving brother.,S01E16,107

Now get her out of here.,S01E16,114
Now let's meet Gabe the wise leader.,S01E16,115
Okay.,S01E16,116
Should I do this?,S01E16,117
No.,S01E16,118
- Just answer these questions.,S01E16,119
- Okay.,S01E16,120
"Gabe, how would you feel about a longer recess?",S01E16,121
I think it's a great idea.,S01E16,122
Some of the teachers think we should have more homework.,S01E16,123
Thoughts?,S01E16,124
That's a terrible idea.,S01E16,125
The amount of homework we do now is good.,S01E16,126
"And finally, new playground rules pro or con?",S01E16,127
I don't like them at all.,S01E16,128
There's safety and there's fun.,S01E16,129
You can't have them both.,S01E16,130
"Loving it.Now say,",S01E16,131
I'm Gabe Duncan and I approve this message.,S01E16,132
I'm Gabe Duncan and I approve this message.,S01E16,133
Awesome.,S01E16,134
We're done.,S01E16,135
You want to play a video game?,S01E16,136
Until the election,S01E16,137
I think it's best we keep this professional.,S01E16,138
Or you could be the dummy.,S01E16,139
Or you could be the dummy.,S01E16,140
Or you could be the dummy.,S01E16,141
We could do this all day.,S01E16,142
We have been doing this all day.,S01E16,143
"Well, I can't be the dummy",S01E16,144
'cause I'm not comfortable with you putting your hands up my shirt.,S01E16,145
You didn't feel that way last week.,S01E16,146
When you had that itch you couldn't reach.,S01E16,147
"All right, then what if we're both dummies?",S01E16,148
"Fine, we're both dummies.",S01E16,149
"I don't know what's been going on in here,",S01E16,150
But you two just made a breakthrough.,S01E16,151
"Hey, ivy, you got a minute?",S01E16,152
"You found out Teddy can't dance, right?",S01E16,153
She's awful.,S01E16,154
I don't want to embarrass myself.,S01E16,155
In front of the whole school.What am I gonna do?,S01E16,156
You gotta tell it to her straight.,S01E16,157
"Just rip the bandage off and say,",S01E16,158
"girl, you stink.",S01E16,159
"You know, that kind of honesty.",S01E16,160
Might be better coming from the best friend.,S01E16,161
You're funny.,S01E16,162
Fine.,S01E16,163
I'll do it.,S01E16,164
I'll just be honest with her.,S01E16,165
I sprained my ankle.,S01E16,166
"Oh, no. What happened?",S01E16,167
I was trying to practice some of your dance moves.,S01E16,168
And then I slipped.,S01E16,169
"Mm, too much hacking on the sacky?",S01E16,170
Exactly.,S01E16,171
And right before the talent show.,S01E16,172
Talk about bad timing.,S01E16,173
"You poor thing, come in.",S01E16,174
Have a seat.,S01E16,175
I'm gonna put your foot up.,S01E16,176
Can I get you anything? Are you hungry?,S01E16,177
A little.,S01E16,178
You know what you need?,S01E16,179
Some homemade chicken soup.,S01E16,180
"Mm, chicken soup.",S01E16,181
For the chicken.,S01E16,182
Jo just put the campaign video on the website.,S01E16,183
You want to watch it?,S01E16,184
"Sure, honey.",S01E16,185
How well do you really know Gabe Duncan?,S01E16,186
I will fight you!,S01E16,187
He hates babies.,S01E16,188
"Gabe, how would you feel if there was no more recess?",S01E16,189
I think it's a great idea.,S01E16,190
Really?,S01E16,191
And what's your opinion about less homework?,S01E16,192
That's a terrible idea.,S01E16,193
The amount of homework we do now is good.,S01E16,194
"And finally, how do you feel about girls?",S01E16,195
I don't like them at all.,S01E16,196
Gabe Duncan,S01E16,197
"No recess, more homework, hates girls,",S01E16,198
Especially baby girls.,S01E16,199
m jo keener and I want to be your president.,S01E16,200
I'm Gabe Duncan and I approve this message.,S01E16,201

But what?,S01E16,204
- Hi.,S01E16,205

You're probably wondering why I'm running on my sprained ankle.,S01E16,207
"Yeah, I kind of was.",S01E16,208
It healed.,S01E16,209
Really?,S01E16,210
Then why do you still have your crutches?,S01E16,211
Lots of good questions here.,S01E16,212
"Spence, what's going on?",S01E16,213
"All right, look, I faked the injury.",S01E16,214
Because there is a problem.,S01E16,215
With what?,S01E16,216
With our dancing.,S01E16,217
"Oh, spence, not everybody gets the exploding jazz hands.",S01E16,218
The first time out.,S01E16,219
It's a process.,S01E16,220
The problem wasn't me.,S01E16,221
Oh.,S01E16,222
It's no big deal.,S01E16,223
Lots of people can't dance.,S01E16,224
And you're one of them.,S01E16,225
"For your information, I'm a great dancer.",S01E16,226
"Teddy, I'm just being honest.",S01E16,227
"Oh, like you were about your ankle?",S01E16,228
"No, you know what? I'm gonna find myself a new partner",S01E16,229
- Someone who appreciates my talent.,S01E16,230
"Teddy, come on.",S01E16,231
"I even knitted you special socks to keep your toes warm,",S01E16,232
'cause that's another thing I'm good at knitting.,S01E16,233
My class is this way.,S01E16,234
I'm so glad we decided to forget the ventriloquist act.,S01E16,235
"Yeah, what were we thinking? Juggling is so much easier.",S01E16,236
"- Okay, throw first.",S01E16,237
"- No, you throw first.",S01E16,238
"- No, you throw first.",S01E16,239

Let's go to the basement and rehearse.,S01E16,244
"Whoa whoa, wait, emmett.What just happened here?",S01E16,245
Teddy just asked me to dance with her.,S01E16,246
Let's not question it.,S01E16,247
So you're just leaving me hanng?,S01E16,248
Don't look at it that way.,S01E16,249
You and I are like best buds.,S01E16,250
We've been through thick and thin together.,S01E16,251
- You know I will always be there,S01E16,252

I love it.,S01E16,258
Duh.,S01E16,259
Really? Cause spencer said I was a bad dancer.,S01E16,260
Let's not talk about spencer.,S01E16,261
He's in the past.,S01E16,262
It's emmett time.,S01E16,263
So which of my moves should we start with?,S01E16,264
Actually I'm thinking that we should save your moves till the end.,S01E16,265
"You don't start a fine meal off with dessert, right?",S01E16,266
Right.,S01E16,267
"So I'll just start dancing,do whatever it is I do",S01E16,268
The meat and potatoes,S01E16,269
And then you can bring it home with the Crimble leg.,S01E16,270
The Crimble leg.,S01E16,271
A little less Crimble leg,S01E16,272
The Crimble leg.,S01E16,273
A little less.,S01E16,274
Less?,S01E16,275

"Hey, how did it go today, honey?",S01E16,280
"Well, one kid said he'd vote for me.",S01E16,281
Then he found his glasses and realized I wasn't jo.,S01E16,282
We have to do something about this jo person.,S01E16,283
You don't have to do anything.,S01E16,284
"No, I do, I do,",S01E16,285
Because nobody attack my babies.,S01E16,286
"Now bob, I want you to go over to jo's house.",S01E16,287
And punch her dad in the face.,S01E16,288
"If he's anything like jono, thanks.",S01E16,289
Once again I am the one who has to do the butt-kicking around here.,S01E16,290
"Honey, would you relax? Nobody needs to kick anything.",S01E16,291
That's right.,S01E16,292

Would you stop stretching? Let's go.,S01E16,296
I'm not stretching.,S01E16,297
I'm stuck.,S01E16,298
"Hey, I think we can really take this thing.",S01E16,299
"Look who we're up against the magician, the roller skaters,",S01E16,300
"The stilt walker, the kid with the tuba.",S01E16,301
"It's a sousaphone or as he pronounces through his braces,",S01E16,302
Shooshaphone.,S01E16,303
"That was erwin and his sousaphone,",S01E16,304
"Playing, believe it or not,",S01E16,305

"Say hello, Charlie.",S01E16,327
I was hoping to get by on cuteness.,S01E16,328
How are we doing so far?,S01E16,329
And as your president I promise to represent you.,S01E16,330
I also promise to fight.,S01E16,331
For more recess and less homework.,S01E16,332
"And of course, I don't hate girls.",S01E16,333
Like some candidates.,S01E16,334
Named Gabe Duncan.,S01E16,335
Thank you.,S01E16,336
"Before I begin, I would like to say something about this campaign.",S01E16,337
Now a lot of things have been said about me.,S01E16,338
"And even though they aren't true, I'm okay with that.",S01E16,339
But when somebody starts attacking my family,S01E16,340
That's where I draw the line.,S01E16,341
Now I could stand here.,S01E16,342
"And tell you who I really am,",S01E16,343
But I'd rather show you.,S01E16,344
"I love all my kids equally,",S01E16,345
"But if I had to pick a favorite,",S01E16,346
It would be Gabe.,S01E16,347
"I changed the oil in your truck, dad.",S01E16,348
Without being askedclassic Gabe.,S01E16,349
"He's just so loving and so caring,",S01E16,350
Especially with his baby sister Charlie.,S01E16,351
"In fact, Gabe was the most excited about Charlie's arrival.",S01E16,352
And he made it himself.,S01E16,353
Gabe's the kind of guy you want to have a root beer with.,S01E16,354
"We'll stay up all night if we have to,",S01E16,355
But I'm gonna make sure you pass that test.,S01E16,356
Don't you have to rescue stray animals.,S01E16,357
And find them good homes?,S01E16,358
Did that before school.,S01E16,359
Classic Gabe.,S01E16,360
"Gabe's not only sweet and kind,",S01E16,361
He also has an amazing fashion sense.,S01E16,362

I know what you're gonna say.,S01E16,373
"You saw the talent show and now you want to say I told you so,",S01E16,374
Because you were right.,S01E16,375
I can't dance.,S01E16,376
Actually I was going to apologize.,S01E16,377
For lying about my ankle.,S01E16,378
"Oh, okay.",S01E16,379
Go ahead then.,S01E16,380
I'm sorry for lying about my ankle.,S01E16,381
I'm sorry I lied about those socks.,S01E16,382
What?,S01E16,383
I didn't actually knit them myself.,S01E16,384
I can't knit.,S01E16,385
Or dance.,S01E16,386
"Hey, if I wanted a dancing knitter,",S01E16,387
I'd date my aunt betty.,S01E16,388
So we're good?,S01E16,389
We're great.,S01E16,390
Emmett,S01E16,391
Get away from me!,S01E16,392
"Hey, Charlie.",S01E16,393

Which is made out to PJ Duncan.,S01E16,396
"Yeah, the one that's based on your cuteness, Charlie.",S01E16,397
And mine.,S01E16,398
"Anyway, I on the other hand owe the school.",S01E16,399
Some money for damages.,S01E16,400
And erwin said he'll shee me in court.,S01E16,401
"So my advice is,",S01E16,402
"If someone ever tells you you're bad at something you love,",S01E16,403
Don't give up.,S01E16,404
Just make sure.,S01E16,405
You don't do it in front of the whole school.,S01E16,406
"And if I ever offer to teach you how to dance,",S01E16,407
"Well, good luck, Charlie.",S01E16,408
"Gabe, lunch.",S01E16,409
All clear.,S01E16,410
"Gabe, really, is all this necessary?",S01E16,411
"Yes, it is.",S01E16,412
I'm the president.,S01E16,413
Of room 12.,S01E16,414

Tomorrow room 14.,S01E16,416
"They're painting room 12, so we're moving to room 14.",S01E16,417
Just eat your sandwich.,S01E16,418
"Gabe, you got a little something on your",S01E16,419
"Oh, whoa",S01E16,420
"Gabe, would you tell the secret service man to get off your brother?",S01E16,421
"Mom, what did I say about bossing me around?",S01E16,422
"Oh, you wouldn't.",S01E16,423
Take her down!,S01E16,424
"How are you doing, dad?",S01E16,425

Celebrity pet castle Is on.,S01E17,3

Living together in a castle would be so great?,S01E17,5
"Last week, howie mandel's cat.",S01E17,6
Ate one of jack black's guppies.,S01E17,7
"oh,cool",S01E17,8
I was thinking we could turn the tv off.,S01E17,9
Wait! Not now.,S01E17,10
They're starting with an elimination!,S01E17,11
I'll get the popcorn.,S01E17,12
I would not want to be beyonce's hamster right now.,S01E17,13
What?,S01E17,14
Mouse! I saw a mouse!,S01E17,15
It was like this big.,S01E17,16
And your high-pitched girl scream scared it away.,S01E17,17
"Hey hey hey, look at this.",S01E17,18
Mouse droppings.,S01E17,19
"Oh, bill.",S01E17,20
That's a rocky mountain grey,S01E17,21
Female,S01E17,22
About to be a mother.,S01E17,23
That is just gross.,S01E17,24
I do not want a mouse or mouse babies in this house.,S01E17,25
"Aw, mouse babies.",S01E17,26
Ew!,S01E17,27
Don't worry about it.,S01E17,28
It's not a problem.,S01E17,29
You know what? Have a seat.,S01E17,30
Watch a master exterminator in action.,S01E17,31
Or we could get back to the show.,S01E17,32
Simon cowell's turtle is coming out of his shell.,S01E17,33
Oh!,S01E17,34
Today's all burnt toast{\i0},S01E17,35
"Running late,and dad jokes{\i0}",S01E17,36

"I close my eyes, take a bite{\i0}",S01E17,38
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud{\i0}",S01E17,39
There it is up on the roof{\i0},S01E17,40
"I've been there, I've survived{\i0}",S01E17,41
So just take my advice{\i0},S01E17,42
"Hang in there, baby,{\i0}",S01E17,43
Things are crazy{\i0},S01E17,44
But I know your future is bright{\i0},S01E17,45
"Hang in there, Baby{\i0}",S01E17,46
There is no maybe{\i0},S01E17,47

"Ah, this thing is so frustrating.",S01E17,53
"Dad, can I get a new phone?",S01E17,54
Nope,S01E17,55
Daddy.,S01E17,56
"Can I please get a new phone, please?",S01E17,57
"Well, since you put it like that",S01E17,58
No.,S01E17,59
But this old phone is useless.,S01E17,60
"I can't download apps, I can't post status updates.",S01E17,61
The only thing I can do on it is talk.,S01E17,62
Nobody does that anymore.,S01E17,63
"Okay, you want a new phone?",S01E17,64
There you go.,S01E17,65
New phone.,S01E17,66
Unlimited minutes.,S01E17,67
And it squeaks.,S01E17,68
"Good for you, dad.",S01E17,69
Tell the princess no for once.,S01E17,70
"Excuse me, but this princess.",S01E17,71
Spends a lot less time on her hair than you do.,S01E17,72
"What's your problem, anyway?",S01E17,73
My problem is everything gets handed to you.,S01E17,74
This is like the first time in history something didn't go your way.,S01E17,75
"Look, honey, if you want a phone, get a job.",S01E17,76
I'm only 15. What kind of job could I get?,S01E17,77
"All right, you know what?",S01E17,78
There's all sorts of dogs in the neighborhood.,S01E17,79
You could walk dogs.,S01E17,80
Or…,S01E17,81
Or not get a new phone.,S01E17,82
"Teddy, a job isn't just about money.",S01E17,83
It's also about self-worth and dignity.,S01E17,84
Wow.,S01E17,85
"Okay, everybody, we are off to our music class.",S01E17,86
You look so cute.,S01E17,87

"I was talking to you, mom.",S01E17,89
"Oh, you're so sweet.",S01E17,90
And you're not getting a phone.,S01E17,91
"Okay, people, the fried chicken business has taken a hit.",S01E17,92
Apparently fried is now bad for your health.,S01E17,93
So we need to think of ways of increasing our sales.,S01E17,94
Dazzle me! You.,S01E17,95
How about we introduce tacos to our menu?,S01E17,96
"Too easy, too expected.",S01E17,97
"Push it, people.",S01E17,98
Punch it! Yeah?,S01E17,99
"How about we fry up other, cheaper kinds of meat.",S01E17,100
"And tell people it's chicken, only it's not chicken?",S01E17,101
We're already doing that. You had number three lately?,S01E17,102
"Work with me, minimum wagers.",S01E17,103
Give me something!,S01E17,104
What you got? J.P,S01E17,105

J.,S01E17,107
Whatever.,S01E17,108
Go.,S01E17,109
"Well, what if we give the business a face?",S01E17,110
Someone who is kwikki chikki.,S01E17,111
Someone to put on posters and bags and buckets.,S01E17,112
Like bobby burger.,S01E17,113
I like bobby burger.,S01E17,114
He always eats the burgers.,S01E17,115
See? That is what we're missing.,S01E17,116
We don't have a mr. Kwik!,S01E17,117
Mr.,S01E17,118
Kwik? Mr.,S01E17,119
Kwik.,S01E17,120
Tell me more.,S01E17,121
"Well, he should be an employee.",S01E17,122
"Probably young, good looking,",S01E17,123
Healthy.,S01E17,124
"You're thinking me, right?",S01E17,125
"Or someone young,",S01E17,126
"Good looking, healthy.",S01E17,127
Mr.,S01E17,128
Kwik.,S01E17,129
I'm going to sleep on it.,S01E17,130
"All right, people, doors open in 10, so look lively.",S01E17,131
"Oh, and what is that smell?",S01E17,132
That's our chicken.,S01E17,133
Ah,S01E17,134
20 years in the business.,S01E17,135
You never get used to it.,S01E17,136
"What are you doing, dad?",S01E17,137
I am loading the mouse trap with a tasty little snack.,S01E17,138
Of peanut butter and horror.,S01E17,139
You haven't caught that thing yet?,S01E17,140
"Kids, let me explain something to you.",S01E17,141
Now I'm not just a guy who catches things.,S01E17,142
Clearly.,S01E17,143
I am also an expert in animal behavior.,S01E17,144
Now the rocky mountain grey feeds at night.,S01E17,145
So by tomorrow morning this trap.,S01E17,146
Is going to have a mouse in it.,S01E17,147
"And that, my friend, is a guarantee.",S01E17,148
100%.,S01E17,149
Somebody needs to take him down a peg.,S01E17,150
Are you gonna mess with dad?,S01E17,151
I'm gabe.,S01E17,152
It's what I do.,S01E17,153
That's the way the money goes,S01E17,154
Pop!goes the weasel.,S01E17,155
Good job.,S01E17,156
"Great job, everybody.",S01E17,157
"Okay, we're gonna take a little juice break,",S01E17,158
Then we will come back for dance-a-lance-a-ling-long!,S01E17,159
Oh.,S01E17,160
"I'm elaine, by the way.",S01E17,161
Nice to meet you.,S01E17,162
"I'm amy, and this is my daughter charlie.",S01E17,163
Charlie?,S01E17,164
"Like, charlie brown?",S01E17,165
"No, not like charlie brown.",S01E17,166
"Charlie, like, short for charlotte.",S01E17,167
"Oh well, as long as it makes sense to you.",S01E17,168
And who is this?,S01E17,169
This is brittany.,S01E17,170
"Yes, you are.",S01E17,171
"Oh, that's so adorable.",S01E17,172
Yeah.,S01E17,173
You named her after a troubled pop star.,S01E17,174
I noticed charlie was very good at clapping.,S01E17,175
"Oh yes, it's one of her many talents.",S01E17,176
"Aww, brittany was clapping at six months, so",S01E17,177
Charlie makes animal sounds.,S01E17,178
"Charlie, what does a cow say?",S01E17,179
Woof.,S01E17,180
Very impressive.,S01E17,181
"Oh, just so you know,",S01E17,182
"Next class, we're asking every mom and child to perform a song together",S01E17,183
"Oh, that sounds fun.",S01E17,184
"And just so you know, it's not a competition.",S01E17,185
It wouldn't be fair,S01E17,186
with my musical theater background,S01E17,187
I was on broadway.,S01E17,188
"Oh, and now you're here,",S01E17,189
So we see how that turned out.,S01E17,190
What happened to you?,S01E17,191
I took your suggestion and became a dog walker.,S01E17,192
A great dane and a larbadoodle.,S01E17,193
Took turns dragging me through a puddle.,S01E17,194
So thanks.,S01E17,195
You're welcome.,S01E17,196
What's in the bag?,S01E17,197
Mostly great dane.,S01E17,198
Where should I put it?,S01E17,199
Trash can.,S01E17,200
Mrs.,S01E17,201
Dabney's trash can.,S01E17,202
"Hey, dad, guess what.",S01E17,203
You washed the car like I asked?,S01E17,204
You are really bad at guessing.,S01E17,205
"No, I had an idea at work and my boss loved it.",S01E17,206
"Hey, good for you.",S01E17,207
"Yeah, it was a great moment.",S01E17,208
And who knows?,S01E17,209
Mr.,S01E17,210
Kwik could be the start of something big.,S01E17,211
This is amazing.,S01E17,212
Ever since you became mr.,S01E17,213
Kwik business is booming.,S01E17,214
"I just want to say, thank you, p.",S01E17,215
J.,S01E17,216
How am I gonna get all that money home?,S01E17,217
You could put it in the trunk.,S01E17,218
Of your brand new car!,S01E17,219
"Can I have your autograph, mr. Kwik?",S01E17,220
Absolutely.,S01E17,221
And who am I making this out to?,S01E17,222
Mrs.,S01E17,223
Kwik.,S01E17,224
Nice car.,S01E17,225
When are you gonna wash mine?,S01E17,226
"Dad, get out of my fantasy.",S01E17,227
"Hello, little mouse.",S01E17,228
Want to help me mess with dad?,S01E17,229
Dad!,S01E17,230
We have a mouse?,S01E17,231
No.,S01E17,232
But the bait is gone.,S01E17,233
What?,S01E17,234
"Oh, come on.",S01E17,235
That's impossible.,S01E17,236
How could a mouse do that?,S01E17,237
I don't know.,S01E17,238
It's almost like he's mocking you.,S01E17,239
"Okay, mouse wants to dance,",S01E17,240
We're gonna dance.,S01E17,241
I wonder what kids with smart dads do for fun.,S01E17,242
"Guys, I'm going inside for just a minute.",S01E17,243
"And while I'm gone no sniffing,",S01E17,244
No biting and no scooching.,S01E17,245
"And brutus, come here.",S01E17,246
"Buddy, remember, fifi is not a chew toy, okay?",S01E17,247
"So, mitch, did you have a chance to think about my mr. Kwik idea?",S01E17,248
"Yes, I did, j.",S01E17,249
P.,S01E17,250
Or should I say.,S01E17,251
Mr. Kwik!,S01E17,252
Really? Me?,S01E17,253
"Yup, you're the new face of kwikki chikki.",S01E17,254
I see great things ahead for you.,S01E17,255
The future is bright.,S01E17,256
Does the future include a bump in pay?,S01E17,257
"No, it does not.",S01E17,258
"Well, doesn't matter.",S01E17,259
Being mr.,S01E17,260
Kwik is reward enough.,S01E17,261
Free soft drinks?,S01E17,262
No,S01E17,263
"But you were right, kid.",S01E17,264
"The face of kwikki chikki needs to be young,",S01E17,265
"Healthy, good looking.",S01E17,266
Like that!,S01E17,267
You mean this?,S01E17,268
"Oh, no no no, this ain't that.",S01E17,269
This is good but that is great.,S01E17,270
She can't be mr.,S01E17,271
Kwik.,S01E17,272
She's a girl.,S01E17,273
Then forget about mr.,S01E17,274
Kwik.,S01E17,275
She'll be our kwikki chick.,S01E17,276
Are you ready to be the face of kwikki chikki?,S01E17,277
I just wanted to use the bathroom.,S01E17,278
I just don't understand why you're mad at me.,S01E17,279
I'm mad at you because you did it again.,S01E17,280
You walked right in there and got the job handed to you.,S01E17,281
My job.,S01E17,282
I didn't do it on purpose.,S01E17,283
Do you know how long I was mr. Kwik?,S01E17,284
37 seconds.,S01E17,285
That's too quick.,S01E17,286
What do you want me to do?,S01E17,287
Quit.,S01E17,288
You already have a job.,S01E17,289
Walking dogs? It's disgusting.,S01E17,290
"No offense, guys.",S01E17,291
P.,S01E17,292
J.,S01E17,293
", I'm sorry you didn't get the job,.",S01E17,294
But I'm not sorry I did.,S01E17,295
"Of course you're not, princess.",S01E17,296
Stop calling me that!,S01E17,297
Stop being that!,S01E17,298
"Oh, brutus, again? Really?",S01E17,299
I'm gonna miss you least of all.,S01E17,300
Night vision goggles check.,S01E17,301
What are you doing?,S01E17,302
I'm catching a mouse.,S01E17,303
With night vision goggles? Really?,S01E17,304
Whatever it takes.,S01E17,305
Nobody makes a fool of bob duncan.,S01E17,306
"No, he does that all by himself.",S01E17,307
Go back upstairs to bed and let the expert do his job.,S01E17,308
Go get mommy.,S01E17,309
Ee-I-ee-I-oh!,S01E17,310
- Break a leg.,S01E17,311
- Uh-huh.,S01E17,312
"Okay, here we go, baby.",S01E17,313
Twinkle twinkle little star,S01E17,314
How I wonder what you are,S01E17,315
Up above the world so high.,S01E17,316
Like a diamond in the sky.,S01E17,317
"No no no, charlie, grab the flashlight.",S01E17,318
Put it back on mommy.,S01E17,319
Put it back on mommy.,S01E17,320
The itsy-bitsy spider went up the water spout,S01E17,321
Down came the rain,S01E17,322
And washed the spider out.,S01E17,323
"Charlie honey, I need you focus.",S01E17,324
Mommy's about to do her big finish.,S01E17,325
Hickory dickory rock,S01E17,326
The mouse ran up the clock,S01E17,327
The clock struck 12:00,S01E17,328
then something else I said,S01E17,329
hickory dickory rock!,S01E17,330
"Thank u, denver!",S01E17,331
There's our kwikki chick!,S01E17,332
"All right, so all you have to do is sit here,",S01E17,333
Sign autogphs and eat chicken.,S01E17,334
I can do that.,S01E17,335
J.,S01E17,336
P.,S01E17,337
", get over here.",S01E17,338
P.,S01E17,339
J.,S01E17,340
Wrong.,S01E17,341
From now on your name is assistant.,S01E17,342
As in assistant to the kwikki chick.,S01E17,343
"If she needs anything, ani mean anything,",S01E17,344
You get it forer.,S01E17,345
"Now, mitch, p.",S01E17,346
J.,S01E17,347
Doesn't have to wait on me.,S01E17,348
"Oh, yes he does.",S01E17,349
Because in our little kingdom.,S01E17,350
You're the princess.,S01E17,351
It's warm in here. Are you warm?,S01E17,352
I do not want you perspiring.,S01E17,353
Fan her.,S01E17,354

"Teddy, what are you doing?",S01E17,364
Silence.,S01E17,365
"Um, can you just eat the chicken now?",S01E17,366
Fine!,S01E17,367
"Mmm! Oh, that's awful!",S01E17,368
She means awful good.,S01E17,369
Ugh!,S01E17,370
How can you people eat this stuff?,S01E17,371
They should call this place icky chikki.,S01E17,372
Get out! You're fired!,S01E17,373
Oh oh oh oh! And f.,S01E17,374
Y.,S01E17,375

And half off.,S01E17,379
"Hey, dad.",S01E17,380
You're still in your bathrobe.,S01E17,381
Why aren't you dressed?,S01E17,382
What's the point?,S01E17,383
Shouldn't you be at work?,S01E17,384
There is no work.,S01E17,385
I quit my job.,S01E17,386
"Wait, what?!",S01E17,387
"If I can't catch a little mouse,",S01E17,388
I don't deserve to call myself an exterminator.,S01E17,389
I'm sorry.,S01E17,390
I'm a failure.,S01E17,391
"No, dad.",S01E17,392
You're not a failure.,S01E17,393
You caught the mouse the first night.,S01E17,394

How'd you figure it out?,S01E17,403
"I told you, I'm an expert at animal behavior.",S01E17,404
"All right, I saw you let the mouse go.",S01E17,405
"So that thing you did with the mouse traps,",S01E17,406
You did that on purpose?,S01E17,407
"Yes, I did that on purpose.",S01E17,408
"You can't prank me, I prank you.",S01E17,409
That's how it works.,S01E17,410
Oh no.,S01E17,411
That's how it used to work.,S01E17,412
How does it feel to be on the other side?,S01E17,413
I don't know who I am anymore.,S01E17,414
Walking dogs again?,S01E17,415
"Uh, yeah.",S01E17,416
Gotta get that phone somehow.,S01E17,417
And it beats working at kwikki chikki.,S01E17,418
"By the way, thanks.",S01E17,419
For what?,S01E17,420
For going all diva and getting fired on purpose.,S01E17,421
It meant a lot to me.,S01E17,422
I don't know what you're talking about?,S01E17,423
Didn't you throw that tantrum just to help me?,S01E17,424
Doesn't sound like me.,S01E17,425
"Okay, well, however you want to play it,",S01E17,426

"Hey, how was Music and me?",S01E17,432
Fine.,S01E17,433
"Listen, could you take charlie to class next time?",S01E17,434
And all the other times after that?,S01E17,435
What happened?,S01E17,436

Apparently the me in Music and me,S01E17,438
Isn't me.,S01E17,439
"Hey, charlie.",S01E17,440

"Even though she didn't want to admit it,",S01E17,444
She did something really nice for me today.,S01E17,445
I guess sometimes we really do care about each other.,S01E17,446
"Who knows, maybe this is the start of a whole new",S01E17,447
P.,S01E17,448
J.,S01E17,449

"I mean, making a competition out of Singing nursery rhymes,",S01E17,462

No apology necessary.,S01E17,464
I can be very competitive.,S01E17,465
"Believe me, no one's more competitive than me.",S01E17,466
I was voted most competitive at competition school.,S01E17,467

Yes,S01E17,469
A three piece combo is what I'd like,S01E17,470

"Wait, hold on. Which point was annoying? This right here?",S01E18,11

We're playing paper football.,S01E18,17
"Oh, paper football.",S01E18,18
Excellent topic.,S01E18,19
Okay.,S01E18,20
Paper football is an american tradition.,S01E18,21
Allowing boys to entertain themselves with nothing more.,S01E18,22
Than a piece of paper and a flat surface.,S01E18,23
What?,S01E18,24
"On the other hand,",S01E18,25
"Paper football requires no athletic ability and no thinking,",S01E18,26
Therefore making it a complete waste of timeAnd paper.,S01E18,27
"Wait, what are you doing?",S01E18,28
I'm on the debate team.,S01E18,29
"I have to prepared to argue any topic, no matter how stupid.",S01E18,30

Jo and I have to do this stupid project together,S01E18,88
on one of the states.,S01E18,89
We got hawaii.,S01E18,90
The most boring of all the states.,S01E18,91
I know.,S01E18,92
Why couldn't we have gotten one of the cool states.,S01E18,93
Like nebraska?,S01E18,94
I had a great idea for that one.,S01E18,95
Let me guess: Dress up like a corn-stalk?,S01E18,96
No.,S01E18,97
"All right, look, it may not be as glamorous as nebraska,",S01E18,98
But you know what? Hawaii's a pretty cool state.,S01E18,99
Name one cool thing about it.,S01E18,100
"Well, it's the only state made up entirely of islands.",S01E18,101
Okay.,S01E18,102

"Dad, we can't just fill up our report with a bunch of facts.",S01E18,104

I like things that explode.,S01E18,108
I don't know.,S01E18,109

J.,S01E18,117
Day?.,S01E18,118
We should do that again.,S01E18,119
We haven't done that since I was seven.,S01E18,120
How about tomorrow? We'll do whatever you want.,S01E18,121
You know what'd be fun?,S01E18,122
Not having a p.,S01E18,123
J.,S01E18,124
-And-mommy day.,S01E18,125
That makes mommy sad.,S01E18,126

J.,S01E18,140
-And-dentist day.,S01E18,141
"Oh, sneaky.",S01E18,142
The only way for me to get him there is for me to trick him.,S01E18,143
So what's this take gabe to laser tag?,S01E18,144
Haircut.,S01E18,145
What's this?,S01E18,146
"I was cleaning out my desk drawer,",S01E18,147
Came across this gift certificate to a day spa.,S01E18,148

"I don't know if you've noticed, but I'm smarter than him.",S01E18,168
What about charlie and gabe?,S01E18,169
"Yeah, they're smarter than him too.",S01E18,170
"Volcano's looking great, dad.",S01E18,171
Do you think it's big enough?,S01E18,172
Good point.,S01E18,173
"Little bigger, dad.",S01E18,174
This is just the frame.,S01E18,175
It's gonna be a whole lot bigger.,S01E18,176
After it's been papier-mached.,S01E18,177
You don't have to tell us.,S01E18,178
Just do it.,S01E18,179
"Gabe, this is my house.",S01E18,180
I don't take orders from you or anybody else.,S01E18,181
"Bob, time to go to the spa.",S01E18,182
"Coming, honey.",S01E18,183
"Okay, kids, let's listen up.",S01E18,184
Now the volcano is going to erupt when you press this button.,S01E18,185
"If you wanted it to erupt again,",S01E18,186
You'd have to take the whole thing apart.,S01E18,187
Therefore and I cannot stress this strongly enough,S01E18,188
Do not press the button.,S01E18,189
What'd he just say?,S01E18,190

"Sorry, honey, it's an extermination call.",S01E18,198
We gotta make one little stop before we get to the spa.,S01E18,199
Really?,S01E18,200
"Honey, it's a 313 code yellow.",S01E18,201
What's that?,S01E18,202
Possum.,S01E18,203

"Well, sure, you want to take all the magic out of it.",S01E18,205
What's this stuff called again?,S01E18,206

"But if you have any problems with charlie,",S01E18,216

Hot tubbing with your grandparents.,S01E18,259

That was a bad idea.,S01E18,261

Skunk.,S01E18,356
"Ah, charlie, stay still.",S01E18,357
Stupid diapers.,S01E18,358
Can you please keep it down back there?,S01E18,359
I'm trying to work here.,S01E18,360
Okay.,S01E18,361
"You know, this would be a lot easier if you helped me.",S01E18,362
"Yes, it probably would, but we had an agreement.",S01E18,363
I'll handle my thing that explodes and you'll handle yours.,S01E18,364
"Well, we've got a problem.",S01E18,365
I'm all out of clean diapers.,S01E18,366
Now what am I gonna do?,S01E18,367
"Okay, Charlie, all better now.",S01E18,368
Is that a shirt And duct tape?,S01E18,369
Yes.,S01E18,370
Oh.,S01E18,371
"See, I call it the shirt diaper.",S01E18,372
The good thing is that she's protected.,S01E18,373
And it's not my shirt.,S01E18,374
"Oh, now what?",S01E18,375
Why can't she just sit still?,S01E18,376
I bet some more duct tape would make her sit still.,S01E18,377
"Hey, I'm gonna need to practice for my debate later.",S01E18,378
Could you give me a topic?,S01E18,379
Okay.,S01E18,380
"How about, why won't you go out with me?",S01E18,381
"No, I need a topic I can argue from both sides.",S01E18,382
"Okay, here we go.",S01E18,383
Is this real life?,S01E18,384
The doctor gave him some anesthesia.,S01E18,385
"Teddy, come on back.",S01E18,386
Teddy?,S01E18,387
I have a sister named teddy.,S01E18,388
"Okay, so you didn't like carrots.",S01E18,389
How about some yummy peaches?,S01E18,390
There you go.,S01E18,391
Oh!,S01E18,392
That's it.,S01E18,393
You're in trouble now.,S01E18,394
"Jo, get in here!",S01E18,395
What do you want now?,S01E18,396
She won't eat.,S01E18,397
Not my problem.,S01E18,398
Hey!,S01E18,399
Don't walk away when I'm talking to you.,S01E18,400
I have work to do.,S01E18,401
I don't care.,S01E18,402
I'm having a really bad day.,S01E18,403
And all I'm asking for is a little respect.,S01E18,404
"Oh, so what I do isn't important?",S01E18,405
Stop putting words into my mouth.,S01E18,406
You know what? That's it.,S01E18,407
I'm outta here.,S01E18,408
You can't leave.,S01E18,409
Oh yeah? Watch me.,S01E18,410
"Jo, wait, don't go.",S01E18,411
It's the first time I've been left alone with Charlie.,S01E18,412
I'm blowing it.,S01E18,413
I can't do this by myself.,S01E18,414
"All right, I'll help you with the baby.",S01E18,415
"But just so you know,",S01E18,416
every doll I've ever had ended up without its head.,S01E18,417
Would you look at that? You're really good with babies.,S01E18,418
"Yeah, I guess I am.",S01E18,419
"If you ever tell anyone, I'll hurt you.",S01E18,420
We're back.,S01E18,421
"Oh, here we go, charlie.",S01E18,422
Here you go.,S01E18,423
Am I in hawaii,S01E18,424
With grandma?,S01E18,425
"I told you, these are my grandma's glasses.",S01E18,426
Just because I'm wearing them doesn't make me grandma.,S01E18,427
"You're cranky, old lady.",S01E18,428
"Hey, Emmett, where's teddy?",S01E18,429
Dropped her off at her debate.,S01E18,430
"Okay, buddy, how about we have a seat?",S01E18,431
This thing followed me all the way home.,S01E18,432
Hey kids.,S01E18,433
Hey dad.,S01E18,434
Why is charlie wearing a shirt diaper?,S01E18,435
"Uh, long story. Where's mom?",S01E18,436
Longer story.,S01E18,437
"Hi, everybody.",S01E18,438
Mommy got stung.,S01E18,439
It was all daddy's fault.,S01E18,440
"Uh, honey, can you get that thing behind you?",S01E18,441
Right back there.,S01E18,442
Love you.,S01E18,443
Shut up.,S01E18,444
"Honey, just scrub yourself real",S01E18,445
good with that tomato juice for about two hours.,S01E18,446
It'll get the smell right out I hope.,S01E18,447
"Kids, don't ever go to the spa with daddy.",S01E18,448
Hey hey hey.,S01E18,449
"Hey, baby girl. I tell you what:",S01E18,450
"Let's get you a real diaper, okay?",S01E18,451
"Oh, that's my ride.",S01E18,452
I'm starving.,S01E18,453
Are you hungry?,S01E18,454
"I can't believe I'm gonna say this,",S01E18,455
But I had fun.,S01E18,456
Me too.,S01E18,457
And we finished a pretty awesome project too.,S01E18,458
I know.,S01E18,459
Can't wait to see that volcano erupt.,S01E18,460
I know.,S01E18,461
Okay.,S01E18,462
"No! No! Wait, don't don't don't!",S01E18,463
Volcano made a boom boom.,S01E18,464
And that is why.,S01E18,465
For the safety of our students.,S01E18,466
"And the peace of mind of our parents,",S01E18,467
I would argue that cell phone use in school.,S01E18,468
"Should not only be allowed,",S01E18,469
It should be encouraged.,S01E18,470
Thank you.,S01E18,471
"Miss duncan, your rebuttal?",S01E18,472
咳,S01E18,473
Cellular phone usage.,S01E18,474
Is a serious problem.,S01E18,475
That presents many challenges for the consumer.,S01E18,476
What?,S01E18,477
"I said,",S01E18,478
Cellular phone usage is a serious issue,S01E18,479
I concede.,S01E18,480
"Hey, charlie, gabe here.",S01E18,481
And I'm doing the video diary tonight.,S01E18,482
Because teddy's having some troubles with her words.,S01E18,483
Nothing serious.,S01E18,484
Yeah.,S01E18,485
"Anyway, today was the first day I took care of you.",S01E18,486
It went totally perfect.,S01E18,487
What?,S01E18,488
"Okay, there were a few problems.",S01E18,489
"But, I mean, you're fine.",S01E18,490
So they're probably going to make me take care of you again.,S01E18,491
Yeah.,S01E18,492
"Good luck, charlie.",S01E18,493
"I've got to say, gabe, I wasn't sure about these things,",S01E18,494
But they are really comfortable.,S01E18,495
Yeah.,S01E18,496
I can't believe how much time I'm,S01E18,497
going to save by not having to go to the bathroom.,S01E18,498
"Dude, ha!",S01E18,499
"I'm saving time right now, if you know what I mean.",S01E18,500
Nice.,S01E18,501
"Hey, dad, game's on.",S01E18,502
Yeah. Whoo!,S01E18,503
"Looking good, dad.",S01E18,504
"Oh, feelin' good, son.",S01E18,505
Whoo! Whoo.,S01E18,506
"Can you believe it, bob?",S01E19,0
Charlie's first big-girl bed.,S01E19,1
She's not a baby anymore.,S01E19,2
"Charlie, do you like your new bed?",S01E19,3
No.,S01E19,4
"Oh, it seems like just yesterday",S01E19,5
I was complaining about giving up this room.,S01E19,6
"Aw, you miss your old room, honey?",S01E19,7
Are you kidding?,S01E19,8
There's two floors between me and the boys now.,S01E19,9
This room is dead to me.,S01E19,10
"Hey, now that charlie's got her own bed,",S01E19,11
"I can have a sleepover, right?",S01E19,12
"Okay, how did charlie's new bed.",S01E19,13
Turn into you getting a sleepover?,S01E19,14
Let me walk you through it.,S01E19,15
"Oh, I love it when he walks us through stuff.",S01E19,16
"Every time I ask you guys for a sleepover,",S01E19,17
You tell me I can't because there's a baby in the house.,S01E19,18
"Well, dad just said she's not a baby anymore.",S01E19,19
And he walked us through it.,S01E19,20
And it's my fault.,S01E19,21
"Look. If I don't have a sleepover soon,",S01E19,22
The other kids will stop inviting me to theirs.,S01E19,23
One night of kids at our house.,S01E19,24
And we get rid of gabe for a bunch of nights.,S01E19,25
Take it.,S01E19,26
It's a good deal.,S01E19,27
"- Fine, you can have your sleepover. - Yes!",S01E19,28
"Come here, charlie.",S01E19,29
Let's look at your new bed.,S01E19,30
You'll love it!,S01E19,31
No,S01E19,32
"I bet you're glad you spent two hours putting that together, huh?",S01E19,33
Today's all burnt toast{\i0},S01E19,34
"Running late,and dad jokes{\i0}",S01E19,35
Has anybody seen my left shoe{\i0},S01E19,36
"I close my eyes, take a bite{\i0}",S01E19,37
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud{\i0}",S01E19,38
There it is up on the roof{\i0},S01E19,39
"I've been there, I've survived{\i0}",S01E19,40
So just take my advice{\i0},S01E19,41
"Hang in there, baby,{\i0}",S01E19,42
Things are crazy{\i0},S01E19,43
But I know your future is bright{\i0},S01E19,44
"Hang in there, Baby{\i0}",S01E19,45
There is no maybe{\i0},S01E19,46
Eveything turns out all right{\i0},S01E19,47

"But trust me, it comes back all around{\i0}",S01E19,49
You're gonna love who you turn out to be{\i0},S01E19,50
"Hang in there, Baby{\i0}",S01E19,51
If you believe it's true,S01E19,52
And if my heart's in you,S01E19,53
No matter what you do,S01E19,54
You'll never face it alone,S01E19,55
And when the rain leaks through,S01E19,56
I'll be right there with you,S01E19,57
No matter what you do,S01E19,58
You'll never face it,S01E19,59
"No, you'll never face it alone.",S01E19,60
How was that?,S01E19,61
"Oh my gosh. Alice, are you having an asthma attack?",S01E19,62
"No, that was the crowd cheering for you.",S01E19,63
You were great.,S01E19,64
"That thing at the end, that was asthma.",S01E19,65
Oh thanks.,S01E19,66
"It's my first audition for a high school show,",S01E19,67
So I really want it to go well.,S01E19,68
"Oh, no worries.",S01E19,69
Since I'll be playing.,S01E19,70
"The piano for everyone's audition,.",S01E19,71

The director sees me do this,S01E19,73
"And when the other kids are auditioning,",S01E19,74
I'll do this,S01E19,75
Wow.,S01E19,76
"Alice, you make a really good stink face.",S01E19,77
We live next to a sewage-treatment plant.,S01E19,78

"Dude, if you don't start eating healthier,",S01E19,84
You're gonna get fat.,S01E19,85
"Teddy, I can eat whatever I want.",S01E19,86
"Nothing happens. Now if you're through here,",S01E19,87
I'd like to take a nap.,S01E19,88
Why don't you just go upstairs to your room?,S01E19,89
'cause this is my fourth cup of bacon.,S01E19,90
And I'm feeling a little woozy.,S01E19,91
"I'm not bothering you, am I?",S01E19,92
A little.,S01E19,93
Can we talk about my sleepover for a second?,S01E19,94
"Gabe, you're distracting me from my housework.",S01E19,95
Of course we can talk about your sleepover.,S01E19,96
"Ok, first question.",S01E19,97
What are you serving us for dinner?,S01E19,98
"Well, I was thinking of making my famous meatloaf.",S01E19,99
With a nice side salad.,S01E19,100
Pizza it is.,S01E19,101
"Okay, now I'm gonna need you to rent us a scary movie.",S01E19,102

I don't want you boys to be up all night.,S01E19,104
"Mom, you just described the perfect sleepover.",S01E19,105
Now the last thing is,S01E19,106

"Hey, zip up the door so no one else can get in.",S01E19,249
"Wait. We're still gonna be able to get more food, right?",S01E19,250

Writing on walls.,S01E19,254
Won't sleep in her bed.,S01E19,255

"I mean, that's something that's because I look like a beast.",S01E19,476
Why do you have scribbles all over your face?,S01E19,477

Ahh.,S01E20,179
"Ah, the new car smell.",S01E20,180
Or is it death?,S01E20,181
Take me to the arcade.,S01E20,182
Step on it.,S01E20,183
Excuse me?,S01E20,184
Arcade place for fun and games.,S01E20,185
Step on it to drive quickly.,S01E20,186
I'm not taking you anywhere.,S01E20,187
"I guess somebody didn't read his contract,",S01E20,188
Which clearly States.,S01E20,189
That you have to give me a ride.,S01E20,190
Whenever and wherever I want.,S01E20,191
You tricked me.,S01E20,192
"Here, I brought you a cute little cap to wear.",S01E20,193
While you're driving me around.,S01E20,194
"Hey, Spencer.",S01E20,195
What's up?,S01E20,196
I just wanted to see if we were still on for tonight.,S01E20,197
"My mom's working, so it's just gonna be you and me.",S01E20,198
That's great.,S01E20,199
And of course Charlie.,S01E20,200
"Oh, wait a minute.",S01E20,201
Tonight? I totally forgot.,S01E20,202
I have a thing.,S01E20,203
A thing? What kind of thing?,S01E20,204
It's a family thing.,S01E20,205
I can't get out of it.,S01E20,206
Oh really? Are you sure?,S01E20,207
"Honey, he's not coming.",S01E20,208
Now chop me up something and put it in the blender.,S01E20,209
"Hey, I thought you said you had a thing.",S01E20,210
"Yeah, but I think we need to talk.",S01E20,211
"Oh, okay.",S01E20,212
Come on in.,S01E20,213
I'd rather do this out here.,S01E20,214
Okay.,S01E20,215
What's going on?,S01E20,216
"Teddy, I don't think this is working out.",S01E20,217
What's not working out?,S01E20,218
Us.,S01E20,219
Wait a minute.,S01E20,220
Are you breaking up with me?,S01E20,221
Yes.,S01E20,222
Why?,S01E20,223
Because of her.,S01E20,224
"Spencer, wait!",S01E20,225
Spencer! Spencer!,S01E20,226
It was just a dream.,S01E20,227
"Oh, Teddy honey, I almost forgot.",S01E20,228
I'm gonna need you to watch Charlie after school.,S01E20,229
I have a dentist's appointment.,S01E20,230
"No, I can't watch Charlie.",S01E20,231
I have plans.,S01E20,232
I was gonna go surprise Spencer at work.,S01E20,233
"Teddy, I've had a temporary crown.",S01E20,234
Since I was pregnant.,S01E20,235
With you.,S01E20,236
"Mom, mom, mom, Charlie's been driving Spencer and I apart.",S01E20,237
"And if I don't go see him today,",S01E20,238
Our entire relationship might be at stake.,S01E20,239
Whoa.,S01E20,240
"Okay, calm down here.",S01E20,241
I was a teenager once.,S01E20,242
I know what you're going through.,S01E20,243
And I'm gonna say to you exactly,S01E20,244
what my mom said to me in times like this,S01E20,245
Get over it.,S01E20,246
That's so unfair.,S01E20,247
"Deal with it, She said to me.",S01E20,248
You're ruining my life.,S01E20,249
I said to her.,S01E20,250
"Now I could give you the rest of the conversation,",S01E20,251
But let's just cut to the chase you're babysitting.,S01E20,252
Strangling me is not gonna help.,S01E20,253
"Dad, dad, dad!",S01E20,254
Hey! Hey!,S01E20,255
"Help me, dad!",S01E20,256
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.,S01E20,257
What is going on?,S01E20,258
He says he owns my car now.,S01E20,259
"You refused to take me where I wanted to go,",S01E20,260
Which means you're in violation of our contract.,S01E20,261
What contract?,S01E20,262
"Here, read this for yourself.",S01E20,263
"Whoa, a lot of words here.",S01E20,264
It clearly States.,S01E20,265
That if P.,S01E20,266
J.,S01E20,267
"Doesn't drive me wherever I want,.",S01E20,268
The old lady's car is mine.,S01E20,269
P.,S01E20,270
J.,S01E20,271
", you did sign it.",S01E20,272
"Dad, it isn't fair.",S01E20,273
He tricked me.,S01E20,274
"Okay okay, all right, all right, here we go.",S01E20,275
The hard part about being a dad,S01E20,276
"Making the tough decisions, right?",S01E20,277
So my decision,S01E20,278
"Uh, check page five, third paragraph.",S01E20,279
This contract is not subject.,S01E20,280
R= arbitration by Bob Duncan.,S01E20,281
Huh.,S01E20,282
"Sorry, P.",S01E20,283
J.,S01E20,284
", my hands are tied.",S01E20,285
Can I at least hurt him a little?,S01E20,286
No.,S01E20,287
Giddy-up.,S01E20,288
"Boy, you've really embraced the whole country Western thing.",S01E20,289
"I've never felt so alive, y'all.",S01E20,290
"I'm happy as a Turkey the day after Thanksgiving,",S01E20,291
'cause it didn't get killed and eaten,S01E20,292
Y'all.,S01E20,293
"Yeah, real country people.",S01E20,294
Don't say Y'all After every sentence.,S01E20,295
I think you let them say what they want.,S01E20,296
When they're babysitting your sister.,S01E20,297
Right.,S01E20,298
So Charlie's upstairs taking a nap.,S01E20,299
"And when she wakes up, she might be a little hungry.",S01E20,300
"Don't worry, partner.",S01E20,301
I'll rustle her up some grub.,S01E20,302
"Okay, well,",S01E20,303
I'd better hop in the saddle and mosey on down to the mall.,S01E20,304
Before Spencer's shift ends.,S01E20,305
"Yeah, it's only cool when I do it.",S01E20,306
What's wrong with you?,S01E20,307
"You want the car? Here, take it.",S01E20,308
I hope I never see it again.,S01E20,309
What are you talking about?,S01E20,310
"Okay, she's in it.",S01E20,311
Who is?,S01E20,312
The old lady.,S01E20,313
She did not go to heaven.,S01E20,314
She just went to the back seat.,S01E20,315
Really?,S01E20,316
You're saying the old lady's ghost is haunting your car?,S01E20,317
"No, she's haunting your car.",S01E20,318
What happened?,S01E20,319
I was just driving.,S01E20,320
And the radio goes on all by itself,S01E20,321
Classical music.,S01E20,322
I don't listen to that.,S01E20,323
Then I smell perfume,S01E20,324
Old lady perfume.,S01E20,325
I don't wear that.,S01E20,326
You're crazy.,S01E20,327
"Dad, will you please tell him there's no such thing as ghosts?",S01E20,328
"I wish I could, Gabe.",S01E20,329
I wish I could.,S01E20,330
You believe in ghosts too?,S01E20,331
"Well, I didn't used to.",S01E20,332
And then came the fontana house.,S01E20,333
"I'm telling you,",S01E20,334
It seemed like a routine extermination,S01E20,335
A black widow nest up in the attic.,S01E20,336
But the widow.,S01E20,337
Turned out to be Mrs. Fontana,S01E20,338
The late Mrs.,S01E20,339
Fontana.,S01E20,340
Late Means Dead.,S01E20,341
You guys are just trying to scare me.,S01E20,342
"I wish we were, Gabe.",S01E20,343
I wish we were.,S01E20,344
Why are you saying everything twice?,S01E20,345
"I don't know, Gabe.",S01E20,346
I don't know.,S01E20,347
"All right, enough.",S01E20,348
I don't believe in ghosts.,S01E20,349
That car is not haunted.,S01E20,350
And thank you.,S01E20,351
Don't say you weren't warned.,S01E20,352
"And remember, if you go in that car,",S01E20,353
"Beware of classical music, smelly perfume",S01E20,354
And murder.,S01E20,355
"Dad, nobody was murdered in that car.",S01E20,356
Not yet.,S01E20,357
Don't move.,S01E20,358
I'm in a relationship crisis.,S01E20,359
This is your lucky day.,S01E20,360
I rarely move.,S01E20,361
Spencer.,S01E20,362
Teddy.,S01E20,363
What's going on? Are you cheating on me?,S01E20,364
What are you talking about?,S01E20,365
I saw you with your arm around that girl.,S01E20,366
"You're cheating on me, aren't you?",S01E20,367
"Attention, everybody.",S01E20,368
Juice boy here is a cheater.,S01E20,369
And he never gives me a full serving either.,S01E20,370
"Teddy, you've got it all wrong.",S01E20,371
"Oh, okay, so you just put your arm around.",S01E20,372
"All your customers, is that it?",S01E20,373
"No, I put my arm around my cousin.",S01E20,374
Your what?,S01E20,375
My cousin Skyler.,S01E20,376
Oh.,S01E20,377
Your cousin Skyler.,S01E20,378
She seems nice.,S01E20,379
"It's okay, everybody.",S01E20,380
She's just his cousin.,S01E20,381
So return to your juices.,S01E20,382
"Look, my break's over.",S01E20,383
Maybe you should go.,S01E20,384
"Yeah, sure.",S01E20,385
I'm sorry.,S01E20,386
It's okay.,S01E20,387
I'm sorry.,S01E20,388
I'm sorry too.,S01E20,389
It's the other kid who never fills it up.,S01E20,390
My own car.,S01E20,391
"The open road,",S01E20,392
"Freedom, wind in my hair,",S01E20,393
And it's all just six years away.,S01E20,394
Perfume? No way.,S01E20,395
"Very funny, P.",S01E20,396
J.,S01E20,397
P.,S01E20,398
J.,S01E20,399
? P.,S01E20,400
J.,S01E20,401
?.,S01E20,402
Get out of my car.,S01E20,403
"Get out of my car,",S01E20,404
Little boy.,S01E20,405
Who said that?,S01E20,406
Or you can stay with me,S01E20,407
Forever and ever and ever!,S01E20,408
Mommy! Mommy!,S01E20,409
Whew.,S01E20,410
That went well.,S01E20,411
"Here, take your stupid car!",S01E20,412
Hi.,S01E20,413
"You're Skyler, right? I'm Teddy.",S01E20,414
"Oh, right.",S01E20,415
I saw your picture in Spencer's wallet.,S01E20,416
Spencer keeps my picture in his wallet?,S01E20,417
That's sweet.,S01E20,418
"Of course I put it in there,",S01E20,419
But it's so sweet he didn't throw it out.,S01E20,420
What have you got there?,S01E20,421
Pie on a stick.,S01E20,422
Where did you get it?,S01E20,423
Pie on a stick.,S01E20,424
It's just my way to say I'm sorry To Spencer.,S01E20,425
Because I kind of freaked out earlier.,S01E20,426
I didn't know you two were cousins.,S01E20,427
I thought you two were cousins.,S01E20,428
"No, Spencer's my boyfriend.",S01E20,429
"No, Spencer's my boyfriend.",S01E20,430
Uh-oh.,S01E20,431
"So you two have met, huh?",S01E20,432
"Yeah, turns out we're cousins.",S01E20,433
"Anything you want to say, Spencer?",S01E20,434
A free sample?,S01E20,435
"Sure, I'd love one.",S01E20,436
"Mm, delicious.",S01E20,437
You should try some.,S01E20,438
Don't forget dessert.,S01E20,439
"Hey, wait.",S01E20,440
How could you?,S01E20,441
I'm sorry. I can exp,S01E20,442
Just don't.,S01E20,443
"Teddy honey, are you okay?",S01E20,444
No.,S01E20,445
Scoot over.,S01E20,446
"Look, I know this probably won't make you feel better,",S01E20,447
But I know what you're going through.,S01E20,448
So you had your heart broken too?,S01E20,449
I did.,S01E20,450
By Warren snodgrass.,S01E20,451
Warren snodgrass?,S01E20,452
"Yeah, he was a lot cuter than he sounds.",S01E20,453
"Anyway, I was madly in love with him.",S01E20,454
And then one day out of the blue.,S01E20,455
He dumped me for Kim Brooks.,S01E20,456
I was devastated.,S01E20,457
So how did you deal with it?,S01E20,458
I didn't.,S01E20,459
"I was a mess, thought my life was over.",S01E20,460
But then I started dating.,S01E20,461
"This tall, blond goof ball named Bob.",S01E20,462
Dad?,S01E20,463
"No, Bob diddlebock.",S01E20,464
But he introduced me to dad.,S01E20,465
"Look, honey, the point is.",S01E20,466
"If I hadn't had my heart broken,",S01E20,467
I never would have met your father.,S01E20,468
Then I would have never been born.,S01E20,469
And I wouldn't be so sad right now.,S01E20,470
"Oh, no no, honey.",S01E20,471
"Oh, it's terrible, I know.",S01E20,472
It stinks.,S01E20,473
"But you know what, babe?",S01E20,474
It will get better.,S01E20,475
I promise.,S01E20,476
"Hi, Charlie.",S01E20,477
I'm here with your sister.,S01E20,478
Who's having her first broken heart.,S01E20,479
My first?,S01E20,480
There's gonna be more?,S01E20,481
"No, honey, this is it.",S01E20,482
"Anyway, by the time you're watching this,",S01E20,483
You might be experiencing your first heartbreak.,S01E20,484
"So just remember, it always gets better.",S01E20,485
And I just wanted to say.,S01E20,486
You were right about Spencer.,S01E20,487
It's too bad you won't have a little sister.,S01E20,488
"Looking out for you when you're my age,",S01E20,489
Although we never know.,S01E20,490
"Oh, we know.",S01E20,491
"Good luck, Charlie.",S01E20,492
What the?,S01E20,493
I'm sorry.,S01E20,494
Leave me alone.,S01E20,495
No.,S01E20,496
No-o-o!,S01E20,497
You such a good sister.,S01E20,498
Come here. Come here,S01E20,499
"Honey, this was such a great idea",S01E21,0
Getting up early so we can have some quiet time together.,S01E21,1
-You're a jerk! -You're an idiot!,S01E21,2
"All right, tomorrow we get up just a little bit earlier.",S01E21,3
"Okay, what's going on, guys?",S01E21,4
I can't take it anymore! He snorts like a pig.,S01E21,5
Oink oink oink!,S01E21,6
"Oh yeah?  Well, you scream in your sleep.",S01E21,7
"All right, enough!",S01E21,8
We've got to have our own rooms.,S01E21,9
"Guys, we've been over this.",S01E21,10
-The house just isn't big enough. -Or is it?,S01E21,11
"I made a diagram, see? New sleeping arrangements.",S01E21,12
Mom and dad go here.,S01E21,13
P.,S01E21,14
J.,S01E21,15
Takes this room.,S01E21,16
Teddy takes this one and I get this one.,S01E21,17
-Everybody's happy. -What about charlie?,S01E21,18
"Oh, I forgot to mention",S01E21,19
In this plan,S01E21,20
Charlie lives with grandma.,S01E21,21
"Gabe, would you just be patient?",S01E21,22
You're gonna get your own room in a couple of years,S01E21,23
When P.,S01E21,24
J.,S01E21,25
Goes off to coll.,S01E21,26
"Well, wherever it is that P.",S01E21,27
J.,S01E21,28
goes off to.,S01E21,29
-Oh hi. -Oh look!,S01E21,30
There's our pretty girl.,S01E21,31
"Hey, you got out of bed today.",S01E21,32
I just came up to get my breakfast.,S01E21,33
"Honey, don't take the brown banana.",S01E21,34
Get the yellow one.,S01E21,35
Yellow's too happy a color.,S01E21,36
I can't believe she's still moping about,S01E21,37
her breakup with spencer.,S01E21,38
That was like two whole days ago.,S01E21,39
"Give her a break, p.",S01E21,40
J.,S01E21,41
Spencer was teddy's first love.,S01E21,42
"Yeah, I mean, you should understand.",S01E21,43
You get dumped all the time.,S01E21,44
"-No, I don't! -Oh really?",S01E21,45
"This year alone you've been dumped by Alexa,",S01E21,46
"Rebecca, Jen",S01E21,47
Jen? I'm dating jen right now.,S01E21,48
Oh.,S01E21,49
I didn't give you that message?,S01E21,50
Today's all burnt toast,S01E21,51
"Running late, and dad jokes",S01E21,52
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S01E21,53
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S01E21,54
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S01E21,55
There it is up on the roof,S01E21,56
"I've been there, I've survived",S01E21,57
So just take my advice,S01E21,58
"Hang in there, baby, ",S01E21,59
Things are crazy,S01E21,60
But I know your future is bright,S01E21,61
"Hang in there, baby",S01E21,62
There is no maybe,S01E21,63
Everything turns out all right,S01E21,64
Sure life is up and down,S01E21,65
"But trust me, it comes back around",S01E21,66
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S01E21,67
"Hang in there, baby.",S01E21,68
"-Okay, everybody, we are off. -Where are you going?",S01E21,69
I joined this great new gym that offers free childcare.,S01E21,70
I get to work out while Charlie plays.,S01E21,71
"Great, honey.",S01E21,72
"Hey, Gabe, you gotta try the double glazed.",S01E21,73
"You know, Bob, they're offering a two-for-one special.",S01E21,74
That's really good to know.,S01E21,75
Why did we only get a dozen of these?,S01E21,76
"Hi, Mrs.",S01E21,77
Dabney.,S01E21,78
What's the problem?.,S01E21,79
"-Why would there be a problem? -Sorry, force of habit.",S01E21,80
I was wondering if anyone was available,S01E21,81
To help me move some junk into my garage.,S01E21,82
I'll do it! For 15 bucks an hour.,S01E21,83
I was thinking of another member,S01E21,84
Of the duncan family.,S01E21,85
Any other member.,S01E21,86
"Sorry, but I'm on my way to the gym.",S01E21,87
I've got a whole list of chores I gotta do.,S01E21,88
I see the first thing on that list is clean out donut box.,S01E21,89
"15 an hour, going once. Going twice",S01E21,90
What about that baby? She looks pretty strong.,S01E21,91
Shall we?,S01E21,92
That's a twist this time I'm leaving with the problem.,S01E21,93
"Teddy, come on.",S01E21,94
I know you're in there.,S01E21,95
"No, I'm not!",S01E21,96
"Okay, you're leaving me no choice.",S01E21,97
oh!,S01E21,98
What died in there?,S01E21,99
My heart.,S01E21,100
"Yeah, I think the smell is coming from the outside of your body.",S01E21,101
When's the last time you took a shower?,S01E21,102
A shower's not going to wash away my pain.,S01E21,103
"Okay, how about my pain?",S01E21,104
"Come on, we gotta break you out of this funk.",S01E21,105
How about some music?,S01E21,106
"No, I no, I already tried that.",S01E21,107
I listened to happy songs and they just made me,S01E21,108
Sad because those people were so happy,S01E21,109
and I'm so sad.,S01E21,110
Do you think,S01E21,111
you're the only person who's ever had their heart broken?,S01E21,112
Remember when Emmett and I broke up?,S01E21,113
"Oh, that's completely different.",S01E21,114
You dumped him.,S01E21,115
And,S01E21,116
He's emmett.,S01E21,117
"Look, you gotta do something.",S01E21,118
"-Ow! -You gotta brush your teeth,",S01E21,119
Then brush your hair.,S01E21,120
"Then brush your teeth again,",S01E21,121
"Because, girl, that breath is nasty!",S01E21,122
"Ivy, you just don't understand what I'm going through.",S01E21,123
Nobody does. My boyfriend was dating another girl,S01E21,124
At the same time he was dating me.,S01E21,125
"Okay. Well, you can either rejoin the world,",S01E21,126
Or crawl back under those covers for the rest of your life,S01E21,127
and be miserable.,S01E21,128
Thank you.,S01E21,129
Thank you.,S01E21,130
It smells a lot better now.,S01E21,131
There's some boxes in here too.,S01E21,132
"Whoa, whose room is this?",S01E21,133
My son Rodney.,S01E21,134
He lives in Florida now.,S01E21,135
"He's my pride and joy, the love of my life.",S01E21,136
What about Mr. Dabney?,S01E21,137
"Yep, love that Rodney.",S01E21,138
This room is so cool.,S01E21,139
"Oh, check out this bed!",S01E21,140
"-It's moving! -It's a waterbed, dummy.",S01E21,141
-It's like a water park.,S01E21,142
-The park's closed.,S01E21,143
Get off!,S01E21,144
Now quit your dilly-dallying,S01E21,145
and get that box off the foosball table.,S01E21,146
A foosball table?,S01E21,147
It's like I'm in heaven.,S01E21,148
Except you're here.,S01E21,149
"All right, now come with me.",S01E21,150
We have to get some stuff out of Mr.,S01E21,151
Dabney's room.,S01E21,152
You and Mr.,S01E21,153
Dabney have separate rooms? My mom and dad don't.,S01E21,154
Check back with me after their 30th anniversary.,S01E21,155
"Rodney, looks like you got yourself a roommate.",S01E21,156
What are you doing?,S01E21,157
I'm talking to Rodney.,S01E21,158
Nobody talks to Rodney but me.,S01E21,159
Come.,S01E21,160
"Charlie, this is Patricia.",S01E21,161
"Oh, what an adorable child.",S01E21,162
Has she had her shots?,S01E21,163
Of course.,S01E21,164
Patricia's going to watch you while mommy,S01E21,165
"Pumps the iron, feels the burn,",S01E21,166
Treads the mill.,S01E21,167
I am so glad to hear you say that.,S01E21,168
We here at flex appeal frown upon members who join the club,S01E21,169
Simply for the free childcare.,S01E21,170
-People do that? -Oh yes.,S01E21,171
And it burns my buns.,S01E21,172
Some of them don't even work out.,S01E21,173
They drop off their kids,S01E21,174
and go down the block to the new spa for,S01E21,175
massages and facials.,S01E21,176
"That's terrible! Down the block, you say?",S01E21,177
"Well, that's my flex appeal spiel.",S01E21,178
"-Come on, Charlie.",S01E21,179
"-Charlie, go to Patricia.",S01E21,180
-All right.,S01E21,181
"Bye, sweetheart.",S01E21,182
-Enjoy.,S01E21,183
"-Thanks, I will.",S01E21,184
-Bye.,S01E21,185
"-Bye, sweetie.",S01E21,186
-We'll have fun.,S01E21,187
"Even if we never see each other again,",S01E21,188
I'll love you always.,S01E21,189
Liar!,S01E21,190
"Oh, why won't the world just go away?",S01E21,191
Surprise.,S01E21,192
Now what do you want?,S01E21,193
"Okay, first of all you can lose the tude.",S01E21,194
"And second, I brought someone",S01E21,195
Who will help you out of your funk.,S01E21,196
Ta-da!,S01E21,197
"-Who's she? -Oh, sorry.",S01E21,198
What?  Skyler?,S01E21,199
You brought over the girl my boyfriend cheated on me with?,S01E21,200
This is how you're helping me?,S01E21,201
I thought you said we were going to go over to the mall?,S01E21,202
This is so not the mall.,S01E21,203
"Look, you said no one",S01E21,204
Understands what you're going through. She does!,S01E21,205
Now get to healing and whatnot.,S01E21,206
How did you find her anyway?,S01E21,207
"I'm going to ask you again, Spencer.",S01E21,208
I want that girl's name and number and I want it now!,S01E21,209
I found her on the internet.,S01E21,210
I have nothing to say to her.,S01E21,211
And I have nothing to say to her.,S01E21,212
"Look, you two are going to talk it out",S01E21,213
And make it all better.,S01E21,214
No one's leaving until then.,S01E21,215
-I really don't see how this is going to help.,S01E21,216
-Me either.,S01E21,217
It hurts!,S01E21,218
It hurts so bad.,S01E21,219
Doesn't smell too good either.,S01E21,220
"Finally running away from home, huh?",S01E21,221
"Just remember, no matter how homesick you get,",S01E21,222
Just keep going.,S01E21,223
I'm not running away. Let's just say,S01E21,224
-I found a place of my own. -What's that supposed to mean?,S01E21,225
It means that I get a room and you get a room.,S01E21,226
And that's all I'm going to say.,S01E21,227
The less you know the better.,S01E21,228
"Well, then you came to the right guy.",S01E21,229
"So you're not going to say anything about this to mom and dad,",S01E21,230
right?,S01E21,231
"I'm sorry, what?",S01E21,232
I was mentally rearranging my room.,S01E21,233
"Okay, then,",S01E21,234
I guess this is goodbye.,S01E21,235
"So long, little bro.",S01E21,236
See you at dinner.,S01E21,237
"Oh, did Spencer ever do that thing where he pretended to yawn",S01E21,238
-Just so he could put his arm around you? -Yeah!,S01E21,239
All the time.,S01E21,240
"Hey, did he ever send you those good night texts?",S01E21,241
Yeah.,S01E21,242
I.,S01E21,243
M.,S01E21,244
Y.,S01E21,245
?.,S01E21,246
-What's that supposed to mean? -I miss you.,S01E21,247
Oh-hhh! I thought it was I made yogurt.,S01E21,248
"Well, did he talk a lot about yogurt?",S01E21,249
"No, never.",S01E21,250
That's what confused me.,S01E21,251
It is a good thing you're pretty.,S01E21,252
"You know, I have to admit it does kind",S01E21,253
Of feel good to talk all this stuff out.,S01E21,254
It really does.,S01E21,255
I don't feel so alone anymore.,S01E21,256
"thank you, Ivy!",S01E21,257
Somebody needed to say it.,S01E21,258
"Oh, you know, I was so upset",S01E21,259
I actually wrote a poem about Spencer.,S01E21,260
Really? I was so upset I wrote a song about him.,S01E21,261
"Well, just the music.",S01E21,262
I couldn't come up with the The,S01E21,263
What are those things that you put into songs?,S01E21,264
-Lyrics? -No.,S01E21,265
The words that you sing.,S01E21,266
Oh my gosh.,S01E21,267
I have an idea.,S01E21,268
"Oooh, I like that look in your eye.",S01E21,269
Why should we be miserable,S01E21,270
When we could make him miserable?,S01E21,271
Ivy's getting tingly.,S01E21,272
I don't understand what's happening.,S01E21,273
We're gonna get even.,S01E21,274
-With Spencer. -Oh-hhh!,S01E21,275
Lyrics! That's what they're called.,S01E21,276
"-Morning, dad.",S01E21,277
-Hi.,S01E21,278
"Oh, man, I had a great night's sleep.",S01E21,279
You didn't fight with your brother?,S01E21,280
"No, it was like he wasn't even there.",S01E21,281
"I mean, he was there",S01E21,282
It just felt like he wasn't there.,S01E21,283
But he was there.,S01E21,284
What did you do to him?,S01E21,285
Nothing. Dad!,S01E21,286
Give me some credit.,S01E21,287
Maybe I'm finally growing up.,S01E21,288
"Oooh, pancakes! Yummy num num!",S01E21,289
"Morning, everybody.",S01E21,290
Why are you swaying?,S01E21,291
Guess I don't have my land legs yet.,S01E21,292
-What?! -Uh,S01E21,293
I had a dream I was on a boat.,S01E21,294
Which explains why you kept mumbling,S01E21,295
"ahoy, matey in your sleep.",S01E21,296
Don't help me.,S01E21,297
"Okay, ladies,",S01E21,298
"Spencer Walsh slap down, take one;",S01E21,299
Music by Skyler;,S01E21,300
Lyrics by Teddy;,S01E21,301
"Produced, rected, choreographed",S01E21,302
By Ivy Renee Wentz.,S01E21,303
How come you get your full name?,S01E21,304
Because I'm the director.,S01E21,305
"Okay, we're feeling angry about Spencer,",S01E21,306
On Action!,S01E21,307
I thought he was the ideal catch,S01E21,308
He said we were a perfect match,S01E21,309
I thought we had a love so sweet,S01E21,310
Until I found out he was,S01E21,311
A big old cheat!,S01E21,312
"Hey, everybody",S01E21,313
Can you dig?,S01E21,314
Spencer Walsh is a two-timing pig,S01E21,315
A football player with big dreamy eyes,S01E21,316
But everything he said turns out to be lies,S01E21,317
Now excuse me if this sounds like a dis,S01E21,318
But that fool don't even know how to kiss,S01E21,319
He was dating her while he was dating me,S01E21,320
Now that big loser is history,S01E21,321
"Hey, everybody",S01E21,322
Can you dig?,S01E21,323
Spencer walsh is a two-timing pig!,S01E21,324
"Ladies, that was perfect.",S01E21,325
Now just one more take and this time I'll hit record.,S01E21,326
-Nice place you got here.,S01E21,327
-P.,S01E21,328
J.,S01E21,329

-How'd you find me? -I live next door.,S01E21,331
I watched you.,S01E21,332
"Dude, this is awesome.",S01E21,333
-Is that a waterbed? -Oh yeah.,S01E21,334
That was so cool!,S01E21,335
"-Let me do you, ready? -Okay.",S01E21,336
Go for it.,S01E21,337
I thought that would be more fun.,S01E21,338
"Dude, this is so sweet, man.",S01E21,339
"You've got everything here waterbed,",S01E21,340
-Comic books -don't forget foosball.,S01E21,341
Oh.,S01E21,342
It's like I'm in heaven.,S01E21,343
Except you're here.,S01E21,344
"And what's in here, you might ask.",S01E21,345
My own bathroom.,S01E21,346
Your own bathroom.,S01E21,347
"I don't even have to go,",S01E21,348
but I'm gonna force myself.,S01E21,349
Whoo!,S01E21,350
"Hi, Charlie!",S01E21,351
"-Hey, baby. -Good workout today?",S01E21,352
"Oh, it was great.",S01E21,353
Really pushed it to the limit.,S01E21,354
"Oh, where exactly did you push it?",S01E21,355
Because I was in the workout room earlier and I didn't see you.,S01E21,356
Because I was at the pool.,S01E21,357
We don't have a pool.,S01E21,358
"Okay, I'm talking about the pool of people who are waiting",S01E21,359
By the stair climber thingamajiggy.,S01E21,360
Uh-huh.,S01E21,361
"You know, Mrs.",S01E21,362
"Duncan,.",S01E21,363
When I add a majiggy to the end of a word,S01E21,364
It usually means I'm trying to hide something.,S01E21,365
-I don't know what you're talking about. -Oh?,S01E21,366
"So if you'll excuse me, I'm late for a",S01E21,367
Very important thingamabob.,S01E21,368
"Hey, Ivy, call me when you get this.",S01E21,369
I just finished editing our music video,S01E21,370
And it looks amazing!,S01E21,371
I can't wait to upload it.,S01E21,372
This will ruin Spencer.,S01E21,373
"Oh, there's Skyler.",S01E21,374
Talk to you later.,S01E21,375
Okay.,S01E21,376
Hi.,S01E21,377
"Spencer, what are you doing here?",S01E21,378
-Can I come in? -I don't think that would be a good idea.,S01E21,379
"Look, I need to talk to you.",S01E21,380
-There's nothing to say.,S01E21,381
"-Yes, there is.",S01E21,382
I want you to know how sorry I am about what happened.,S01E21,383
I made a huge mistake.,S01E21,384
Hanging out with Skyler was the stupidest thing I've ever done.,S01E21,385
"Teddy,",S01E21,386
You're the one I want to be with.,S01E21,387
"-Spencer, I -look!",S01E21,388
"I know I don't deserve it,",S01E21,389
But is there any way you can forgive me?,S01E21,390
We can just start over?,S01E21,391
"No, I can't.",S01E21,392
I just don't think I can trust you.,S01E21,393
I'm sorry.,S01E21,394
Me too.,S01E21,395
Joining that gym up the street,S01E21,396
Is the smartest thing I've ever done.,S01E21,397
"Oh, just go a little deeper on the glutes, I've got four kids.",S01E21,398
Oh yeah! That's the spot.,S01E21,399
"Oh, lots of tension there.",S01E21,400
Mamama.,S01E21,401
"Hi, Charlie.",S01E21,402
Charlie?!,S01E21,403
Your membership has been revoked.,S01E21,404
Hi.,S01E21,405
-What are you doing here? -I'm taking my turn in the cool room.,S01E21,406
-We're not taking turns.,S01E21,407
"-Yes, we are.",S01E21,408
-And tonight is my turn.,S01E21,409
"-Well, I'm not leaving.",S01E21,410
"-Well, neither am I.",S01E21,411
"-Well, neither am I.",S01E21,412
"-Well, neither am I.",S01E21,413
"-Well, neither am I.",S01E21,414
"-Well, neither am I.",S01E21,415
"-Well, neither am I.",S01E21,416
"-Well, neither am I.",S01E21,417
"-Well, neither am I.",S01E21,418
"-Well, neither am I.",S01E21,419
"-Well, neither am I.",S01E21,420
Well?,S01E21,421
I have absolutely no explanation for this.,S01E21,422
"Hi, Charlie. So, um",S01E21,423
I decided not to put the Spencer video online.,S01E21,424
"I mean, just because somebody hurts you doesn't mean",S01E21,425
you need to hurt them back.,S01E21,426
So do what I did.,S01E21,427
Find some friends to help you get through it.,S01E21,428
"Oh, when we get done talking to your sister,",S01E21,429
Are we gonna put the spencer video online?,S01E21,430
"Uh, no.",S01E21,431
That's kind of the whole point of what I just said.,S01E21,432
"I don't get you. I mean,",S01E21,433
"I don't get a lot of things, but I really don't get you.",S01E21,434
This is Skyler. Isn't she pretty?,S01E21,435
"Wish her good luck, charlie.",S01E21,436
I don't care what anybody says.,S01E21,437
No one's going to keep me out of this room.,S01E21,438
-Or me. -No!,S01E21,439
"come-on, Charlie. We can all share!",S01E21,440
Yay!,S01E21,441
-Onoy? Drug? Can he can? -Oh-Oh.,S01E21,442
Charlie? I Know You're in-here.,S01E21,443
-is Yours fuall-bros? -Bros!,S01E21,444
"Oh, you've got to be kidding me.",S01E22,0
Listen to spencer's latest status update.,S01E22,1
just chilling at home. who cares?,S01E22,2
Apparently you do.,S01E22,3
Mom.,S01E22,4
"No no, I do not.",S01E22,5
I could care less what my ex-boyfriend is up to.,S01E22,6
"Oh, he hasn't even changed his online status yet.",S01E22,7
It still says in a relationship.,S01E22,8
- He just can't let me go.,S01E22,9
"- Well, maybe he forgot to change it.",S01E22,10
"Uh, mom, how could he forget? He's online all the time.",S01E22,11
And you know this how?,S01E22,12
I check his status every hour.,S01E22,13
"Well, the important thing is you've moved on.",S01E22,14
"Gabe honey, you have a playdate this afternoon.",S01E22,15
"- No, I don't.",S01E22,16
"- Yes, you do.",S01E22,17
A new family moved in down the street.,S01E22,18
"And they have a son your age,",S01E22,19
So I made plans for the two of you to get together.,S01E22,20
"Oh, mom, let me explain where you went wrong.",S01E22,21
I'm 11.,S01E22,22
I don't have playdates anymore.,S01E22,23

His name is austin and I think he'll be.,S01E22,25
A very good influence on you.,S01E22,26
He's very well-behaved.,S01E22,27
You know that well-behaved and I are natural enemies.,S01E22,28
Could you just be nice?,S01E22,29
"Okay, be civil.",S01E22,30

Please don't be a plumbing problem.,S01E22,32
Please don't be a plumbing problem!,S01E22,33
Thank you.,S01E22,34
We'll be in touch.,S01E22,35

And that fuller sound is gonna come from a didgeridoo?,S01E22,42
Is that what that thing is called?,S01E22,43
"All right, look. How much longer are these auditions gonna go on?",S01E22,44

Next.,S01E22,48
Thanks.,S01E22,49
"Uh, you can keep the microphone.",S01E22,50
Wait.,S01E22,51
Stop.,S01E22,52
- That was awful.,S01E22,53
"- Emmett, don't be rude.",S01E22,54
"I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna sugarcoat it,",S01E22,55
Even if she is my grandma.,S01E22,56
"- What do you think?  - Well, he's pretty good,",S01E22,57
But I'm not sure if he has the right look.,S01E22,58
What do you mean?,S01E22,59
"Well, you and me are so hot.",S01E22,60
And he's so,S01E22,61
Not.,S01E22,62
I can't argue with that.,S01E22,63
"Listen, jimmy.",S01E22,64
We're gonna think about it and let you know.,S01E22,65

"Well, I wasn't sure what activities you had planned,",S01E22,81
So I settled on daytime casual.,S01E22,82
"Really, mom?",S01E22,83
This is how you want me to spend my afternoon?,S01E22,84
"Well, you boys have fun.",S01E22,85
I'll be upstairs with charlie.,S01E22,86
Poor little bby's not feeling well.,S01E22,87
Poor little gaby's not feeling so hot either.,S01E22,88
"What do you want to do, play video games?",S01E22,89

I've already exceeded my allotted one hour of the week.,S01E22,91

She's glorious.,S01E22,101
What an exquisite creature.,S01E22,102
"Look, we have to figure out how to get through this.",S01E22,103
So either you stop being weird or,S01E22,104
"Yeah, that's the only way.",S01E22,105
that's why monkeys shouldn't fly,S01E22,106
- Planes!  - Yeah.,S01E22,107
- Yes!  - Yeah!,S01E22,108
Yeah! That was awe-teous!,S01E22,109

Just let him do it.,S01E22,118
"Charlie honey, drink your juice.",S01E22,119
- It'll make you feel better.,S01E22,120
- No no.,S01E22,121
I don't think you should argue with me.,S01E22,122
I know a lot more words.,S01E22,123
"May I have some water, please?",S01E22,124
"Sure, jimmy, coming right up.",S01E22,125
"Well, aren't you a cutie-pie?",S01E22,126
I'd be lying if I said I hadn't heard that before.,S01E22,127
- I I meant the baby.,S01E22,128
- Right.,S01E22,129
Huh.,S01E22,130

Sick.,S01E22,132
Whoa.,S01E22,133
She blasted me with snot.,S01E22,134
Which was also the name of my last band.,S01E22,135
It's austin.,S01E22,136
Tell him I'm not here.,S01E22,137
"Sorry, austin, gabe's not here.",S01E22,138
He's hiding under that blanket.,S01E22,139

I brought you some presents.,S01E22,142
An african orchid.,S01E22,143
I cultivate them myself.,S01E22,144
I also made you some soap.,S01E22,145
Thank you.,S01E22,146
I was running low on orchids and soap.,S01E22,147
Anything else?,S01E22,148
I also wanted to ask you something.,S01E22,149
- Okay.  - Will you go with me?,S01E22,150
Go with you where?,S01E22,151
I'm asking you to be my girlfriend.,S01E22,152
"Wait. I I'm sorry, what?",S01E22,153
I'm almost 16 and you're 11.,S01E22,154
And a half.,S01E22,155
I believe there's a question on the table.,S01E22,156
"Teddy, love knows no age.",S01E22,157
But it does know height.,S01E22,158
"Austin, I'm flattered, but I just came out of a relationship.",S01E22,159
"I have loved, let us see if that's all.",S01E22,160
E.,S01E22,161

"Your words say one thing, but your eyes say another.",S01E22,168
Okay.,S01E22,169
Focus on my hands.,S01E22,170
They're pushing you out the door.,S01E22,171
This is not over. I shall return!,S01E22,172

What's the bad news? - Jimmy's sick.,S01E22,175

- Dad?  - Hey.,S01E22,181
Oh sorry.,S01E22,182
I saw it here.,S01E22,183
I couldn't resist.,S01E22,184
"- How'd you learn to do that?  - When I was in high school,",S01E22,185
I had my own band the bob duncan experience.,S01E22,186
You were in a band? How come I never knew that?,S01E22,187
Because whenever I start a story.,S01E22,188
"With when I was in high school, you zone out.",S01E22,189
I'm sorry. What?,S01E22,190
"Well, mr.",S01E22,191
D.,S01E22,192

How would you like,S01E22,194
Band meeting.,S01E22,195
Band meeting?,S01E22,196
That's not good.,S01E22,197
That's how I got thrown out.,S01E22,198
Of the bob duncan experience.,S01E22,199
"Emmett, I don't want to be the loser who's in a band with his dad.",S01E22,200
"A little quieter, guys.",S01E22,201
"I know he's old,",S01E22,202
But what choice do we have?,S01E22,203
Still hearing it.,S01E22,204
I guess you're right.,S01E22,205
Dad,S01E22,206
Do you want to do the gig with us?,S01E22,207
Yes! The experience continues!,S01E22,208
I'm back!,S01E22,209
For one gig only.,S01E22,210
For one gig only.,S01E22,211

- Hey.,S01E22,218

"Okay. Spencer, uh,",S01E22,220
"This is awkward, but I have to tell you something.",S01E22,221
"- Sure, what is it?  - Well, I heard your online status.",S01E22,222
Says you're in a relationship,S01E22,223
"Somebody told me, I don't remember who",S01E22,224
So you should probably change that.,S01E22,225
- I'm just saying.,S01E22,226
"- Actually, I did change it.",S01E22,227
- And then I changed it back.,S01E22,228
- Huh.,S01E22,229
"Okay look,.",S01E22,230
I know you still have feelings for me.,S01E22,231
I get it.,S01E22,232
I have that effect on people.,S01E22,233
"But really, it's time to move on, okay?",S01E22,234
"Teddy, my status isn't about you.",S01E22,235
I oh.,S01E22,236
Her name's nicole.,S01E22,237
We've had a few dates.,S01E22,238
She doesn't go to our school.,S01E22,239
"Well, that'sthat's good for you.",S01E22,240
"I mean it's good for both of us, actually,",S01E22,241
Because I'm also in a relationship.,S01E22,242
- You are?  - Yes.,S01E22,243
"- Cool. Who is it?  - Uh, austin",S01E22,244
Is his name.,S01E22,245
Austin doesn't go to our school.,S01E22,246
He,S01E22,247
Got me this candle.,S01E22,248
Whatever.,S01E22,249
Ah.,S01E22,250
That's nice.,S01E22,251
"Yeah, he's thoughtful like that.",S01E22,252
Ah.,S01E22,253
It's nicole.,S01E22,254
- I should probably take this.,S01E22,255
- Oh sure.,S01E22,256
Go for it.,S01E22,257
I have to call austin anyway,S01E22,258
Once he's old enough to have a phone.,S01E22,259
"Hey, te oh.",S01E22,260
Please tell me you're not still obsessing about spencer.,S01E22,261
"No no, I'm obsessing about some girl named nicole.",S01E22,262
Who he's supposedly dating.,S01E22,263
But I don't think she exists.,S01E22,264
I just scrolled through all 452 of his friends.,S01E22,265
And there's not one nicole.,S01E22,266
You think he made up a fake girlfriend.,S01E22,267
Just to get a rise out of you?,S01E22,268
"Oh, that is sad and pathetic.",S01E22,269
"Well, in certain situations.",S01E22,270
It's understandable.,S01E22,271
What's your fake boyfriend's name?,S01E22,272
Austin.,S01E22,273
- Oh teddy.  - I panicked!,S01E22,274
At least he's a real guy.,S01E22,275
"For you, my love!",S01E22,276
Is that the lute?,S01E22,277
"Oh, I love the lute.",S01E22,278
"Sorry, austin.",S01E22,279
Now's not a good time.,S01E22,280
"Teddy, go out with me.",S01E22,281
- No.,S01E22,282
- Then I will continue to serenade you.,S01E22,283
With every instrument at my disposal.,S01E22,284
But you should know.,S01E22,285
My father owns a music store.,S01E22,286
So what's it gonna take to make you go away?,S01E22,287
One date.,S01E22,288
"Okay, fine.",S01E22,289
Let's get this over with.,S01E22,290

I shall return Saturday afternoon.,S01E22,293
- Shall we say 1:00-ish?  - Say whatever you want.,S01E22,294
Our relationship ends at 3:00-ish.,S01E22,295
Until then I bid you a gentle good morrow.,S01E22,296
Yahoo!,S01E22,297
"Dad! Come on, let's have a look at you.",S01E22,298
Huh? Look at that.,S01E22,299
Can I pass for a teenager?,S01E22,300
Absolutely.,S01E22,301
Just stay out of direct light,S01E22,302
Or any light.,S01E22,303
"- Is that a zit?  - Yep, drew that on myself.",S01E22,304
"Makes me look younger, huh?",S01E22,305
Ugh.,S01E22,306
"Putting a lot of pressure on one little zit, dad.",S01E22,307
Okay.,S01E22,308
Dad.,S01E22,309
- Let's go over it one more time.,S01E22,310
"- Oh, all right.",S01E22,311
My name is bo.,S01E22,312
I go to north high.,S01E22,313
"And, if anybody asks, I have a bizarre medical condition.",S01E22,314
- That makes me look older.  - Called?,S01E22,315
Old-man-itus.,S01E22,316
We're good.,S01E22,317
"Oh, honey.",S01E22,318
Want to go out with a teenager tonight?,S01E22,319
Not with that zit.,S01E22,320
This is our date?,S01E22,321
Your six-year-old cousin's birthday party?,S01E22,322
I couldn't show up without a date.,S01E22,323
That would be embarrassing.,S01E22,324
We wouldn't want anyone here to be embarrassed.,S01E22,325
"Oh, no, I've arranged a private table for us.",S01E22,326
How romantic.,S01E22,327
I slipped the clown a few dollars.,S01E22,328
He'll be by shortly.,S01E22,329
"Come on, swing like you mean it!",S01E22,330
She's gonna be seven by the time we get out of here.,S01E22,331
It won't take that long.,S01E22,332
"After the pinata, we have cake.",S01E22,333
- Then we kiss and it's over.  - What did you say?,S01E22,334
We have cake.,S01E22,335
"Uh, it's your turn.",S01E22,336
Ah.,S01E22,337
Let's do this.,S01E22,338
"Open your bags, girls.",S01E22,339
This pretty rainbow's going down.,S01E22,340
"Yeah, that's what I'm talking about! Whoo!",S01E22,341
- Teddy?  - Oh! Spencer.,S01E22,342
"That is you, uh, tiger.",S01E22,343
- How do you do?  - Oh my gosh.,S01E22,344
How do I do what?,S01E22,345
- I'm austin.  - This is austin?,S01E22,346
The guy you're in a relationship with?,S01E22,347
"Well, it's just our first date.",S01E22,348
We're taking things slow.,S01E22,349
"Um, well, I should go.",S01E22,350
Nicole's waiting for me.,S01E22,351
- It was nice to meet you.,S01E22,352
"- And you, sir.",S01E22,353
Are you okay?,S01E22,354
Not really.,S01E22,355
That was my ex-boyfriend.,S01E22,356
"- Oh. - He's here with nicole,",S01E22,357
Who is pretty and real.,S01E22,358
And you're here with an 11-year-old.,S01E22,359
Pretty much.,S01E22,360
"Well, you know, teddy,",S01E22,361
"I may be only 11,",S01E22,362
But I'm old enough to know you deserve someone.,S01E22,363
Who will appreciate how wonderful you are.,S01E22,364
"And for your information, spencer ain't it.",S01E22,365
- Did you just say ain't?  - Listen to me.,S01E22,366
"I'm so passionate, I'm throwing grammar to the wind.",S01E22,367
"Yeah thanks, austin.",S01E22,368
"And you know, as first dates go,",S01E22,369
This wasn't all that bad.,S01E22,370
"Not now, slappy.",S01E22,371
"Anyway, you really",S01E22,372
You deserve somebody great too.,S01E22,373

"Kind and, well, 11.",S01E22,375
"Shall we grab our goody bags, quick kiss.",S01E22,376
- And get out of here?  - What did you say?,S01E22,377
I said let's grab our goody bags.,S01E22,378
that's why monkeys shouldn't fly,S01E22,379
planes!,S01E22,380
This is awful.,S01E22,381
We're totally bombing.,S01E22,382
They're not even paying attention to us.,S01E22,383
"All right, guys.",S01E22,384
Calm down.,S01E22,385
"If there's anything I learned from the bob duncan experience,",S01E22,386
"It's that if you want to get people to notice you,",S01E22,387
- You give them something to notice.  - How do you do that?,S01E22,388
Band meeting.,S01E22,389
"Okay, guys, follow my lead.",S01E22,390
This crowd's about to get fired up.,S01E22,391

Dad breathed fire. It was so awesome,S01E22,408
The first time.,S01E22,409
The second time there were some problems.,S01E22,410
No big deal.,S01E22,411

I thought you already bought jimmy a bass.,S01E22,427
"- This is for me.  - Dad, um,",S01E22,428

You being in the band was just a one-time thing.,S01E22,430

"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S01E22,455
There it is up on the roof,S01E22,456
"I've been there, I've survived",S01E22,457
So just take my advice,S01E22,458

She's gonna tell me it's the wrong one.,S01E23,6
"Wow, dad. When did you become so afraid of mom?",S01E23,7
I ask your mother.,S01E23,8
"Hey, mom, can I ask you a question?",S01E23,9
"Okay, why can't people learn to use their car alarms?",S01E23,10
"- Turn it off, jerk!  - Uh, mom, that jerk is you.",S01E23,11
- What?   - That's your car alarm.,S01E23,12
"Oh, well, that's entirely different.",S01E23,13
- Why is it going off?   - That's why.,S01E23,14
Uh-oh.,S01E23,15
Charlie's going through her button-pushing phase.,S01E23,16
"- Isn't it adorable?   - Yeah yeah, real cute baby.",S01E23,17
"- Can we get back to me now?  - Okay, honey, what is it?",S01E23,18
The kids at school are teasing me again.,S01E23,19
"- About your hair?   - No, about my bike.",S01E23,20
- What's wrong with my hair?   - Nothing.,S01E23,21
"It worked when you were five, it works now.",S01E23,22
"Okay, now what about your bike?",S01E23,23
It's lame.,S01E23,24
I need a new one.,S01E23,25
"Oh, a new bike, huh?",S01E23,26
- Ask your father.   - Really?,S01E23,27
"No, I'm just kidding.",S01E23,28
You can't have a new bike.,S01E23,29
Everyone knows your bike is a statement of who you are.,S01E23,30
My bike says this guy is a total geek.,S01E23,31
Same thing your haircut says.,S01E23,32
"Hey, honey. What you working on?",S01E23,33
"Oh, nothing.",S01E23,34
Do you mind?,S01E23,35
I can't help it.,S01E23,36
I saw the word mom.,S01E23,37
"Okay, I'm writing a script for my drama class.",S01E23,38
We're supposed to shoot a short film.,S01E23,39
About an important moment in our lives.,S01E23,40
Ooh ooh! Which moment?,S01E23,41
I've been involved in so many.,S01E23,42
"Well, it's about the day you and dad sat me down.",S01E23,43
And told me you were expecting charlie.,S01E23,44
"- Can I read it?  - Sure, when I'm finished.",S01E23,45
"No, come on.",S01E23,46
I'm really excited.,S01E23,47

"Teddy, we need to talk to you.",S01E23,53
"Oh, this is really good.",S01E23,54
Mom exits.,S01E23,55
Where does it say that? I don't see that.,S01E23,56
"No no, it doesn't.",S01E23,57
I'm saying that.,S01E23,58
"Guys, I'd like you to meet my new girlfriend Nina.",S01E23,59
"Nina, this is my best friend P.",S01E23,60

"Come on in. Emmett, when did you get a girlfriend?",S01E23,66
Like 20 minutes ago.,S01E23,67
I rushed right over as soon as it happened.,S01E23,68
Emmett has told me so much about you.,S01E23,69
She talks like that all the time.,S01E23,70
- She's from south america.,S01E23,71
- Venezuela.,S01E23,72
I thought you said south america.,S01E23,73
"Emmett, venezuela is in south america.",S01E23,74
Right?,S01E23,75
"Yeah, they have trouble with subjects ending in -ography.",S01E23,76
And -ath.,S01E23,77
and -ience.,S01E23,78
"Teddy, can I talk to you for a second?",S01E23,79
- Sure.,S01E23,80
- I'll be right back.,S01E23,81
Okay.,S01E23,82
So how long have you been in the country?,S01E23,83
- Only one day.,S01E23,84
- That explains how you ended up with emmett.,S01E23,85
"So, Teddy,",S01E23,86
Since I have a girlfriend now.,S01E23,87
This thing that's been going on between us,S01E23,88
"Mmm, that thing that exists only in your head?",S01E23,89
"Yeah, that  it's over.",S01E23,90
Okay.,S01E23,91
That's good.,S01E23,92
Deny the pain.,S01E23,93

"Dad! Dad, dad, quick! Get in here!",S01E23,97
My bike is gone! Somebody stole it!,S01E23,98
"- What? - Yeah, the garage door is wide open.",S01E23,99
But I closed it when I came in.,S01E23,100
"Well, somebody opened it,",S01E23,101
And I think I know who.,S01E23,102
- Charlie did it.,S01E23,103
- No.,S01E23,104
You did that! She's pushing the buttons again.,S01E23,105
"Hang on, hang on.",S01E23,106
Hey you.,S01E23,107
How did charlie even get the garage door remote?,S01E23,108
Who cares? Wheelie is gone.,S01E23,109
- You called your bike wheelie?  - I used to.,S01E23,110
I loved that old bike.,S01E23,111
Hey hey hey hey hey.,S01E23,112
It's okay.,S01E23,113
You know what? We're gonna get you a new one.,S01E23,114
"Okay, I'll be in the car.",S01E23,115
"Teddy honey, your script is terrific.",S01E23,116
"- I love it.  - Oh, mom, I'm so glad you like it,",S01E23,117
'Cause I thought you were gonna be critical.,S01E23,118
"But you're not critical, you're just really smart.",S01E23,119
"Okay, so who's in it?",S01E23,120
Who's playing the duncans?,S01E23,121
"Oh, kids from my drama class.",S01E23,122
"This one kid, Walter, is playing dad.",S01E23,123
Blah blah blah. Who's playing me?,S01E23,124
I haven't cast the mom role yet.,S01E23,125
I'm having auditions later.,S01E23,126
"Oh, okay. Well, if you need me to do anything,",S01E23,127
"Just let me know. I could do props,",S01E23,128
Costumes or play mom whatever.,S01E23,129
Here we go.,S01E23,130
"You know, I don't know if I've told you this,",S01E23,131
But when I was younger I did a lot of theater.,S01E23,132
Really? What did the southwest denver.,S01E23,133
Community college daily bugle say?,S01E23,134
The southwest denver community college daily bugle,S01E23,135
Called my maggie from cat on a hot tin roof,S01E23,136
Purr-fect.,S01E23,137
Ah.,S01E23,138

That's Nice.,S01E23,157
"Uh, I hope you don't think I'm being too forward,",S01E23,158
But I find you very intriguing.,S01E23,159
I find you standing very close now.,S01E23,160
This is my number.,S01E23,161

"- Hi, honey.",S01E23,168

Gabe's bike got stolen.,S01E23,171
Poor kid was crushed.,S01E23,172
What are you talking about? He hated his old bike.,S01E23,173
"- Wheelie?  - Yes, weally.",S01E23,174
Are we talking like this for a weason?,S01E23,175
"No, wheelie is what he called his bike.",S01E23,176
Yesterday he called his bike lame.,S01E23,177
And then asked me for a new one.,S01E23,178
Huh.,S01E23,179
"Kinda suspicious, don't you think?",S01E23,180
Yeah.,S01E23,181

Bananas.,S01E23,184

They secretly want to date behind their best friend's back?,S01E23,186
Ciao.,S01E23,187
Wait. What?,S01E23,188
Nina flirted with me at school today.,S01E23,189
"- No, she didn't.",S01E23,190
- Did too.,S01E23,191
"Okay, maybe you didn't understand her.",S01E23,192
I understand english.,S01E23,193
I've been speaking it since I was seven.,S01E23,194
I think you're making things up.,S01E23,195
"Dude, she said  I find you intriguing.",S01E23,196
"Now I don't speak spanish, but that has got to be a come-on.",S01E23,197
All righty. Are you guys ready?,S01E23,198
Hey.,S01E23,199

"Thank you, honey.",S01E23,201
I'm so lucky to have you.,S01E23,202
"Uh, mom, that's walter.",S01E23,203
He's playing dad.,S01E23,204
"Please, call me Bob.",S01E23,205
It'll help me stay in character.,S01E23,206
"Take your arm away, bob.",S01E23,207
And this is Kimmy.,S01E23,208
She's playing me.,S01E23,209
Question about character.,S01E23,210
Why did you name her teddy?,S01E23,211
"Well, we just really liked the name.",S01E23,212
That was you blowing my mind.,S01E23,213
She was the only one who tried out.,S01E23,214
"Well, have you found a mom yet?",S01E23,215
"Oh, no, all the amy candidates are out on the porch.",S01E23,216
"Oh, okay.",S01E23,217
Whatever.,S01E23,218
"I wasn't even thinking about that, really.",S01E23,219
Is that the mail I hear? I'm just gonna go check and find out.,S01E23,220
"Sorry, girls, the video sheet's been canceled.",S01E23,221
"Yeah, the duncans have head lice.",S01E23,222
"Okay, first let's",S01E23,223
"Hey, where'd everybody go?",S01E23,224
Beats me.,S01E23,225
Anything mom can do for you?,S01E23,226
Wow.,S01E23,227
You're unbelievable.,S01E23,228
"Okay, well,.",S01E23,229
"Seeing as I have no other choice, would you",S01E23,230
Yes!,S01E23,231
"Okay, here we.",S01E23,232
"Mom, come on.",S01E23,233
I want to get started.,S01E23,234
- Coming!   - I spend more time.,S01E23,235
Waiting for that woman.,S01E23,236
"Mom, why did you change?",S01E23,237
"- The script says Amy's in scrubs.   - Oh, honey,",S01E23,238
I learned in college theater.,S01E23,239
That the script is really just an outline.,S01E23,240
Okay.,S01E23,241
"All right, everyone, here we go.",S01E23,242
"Bob and Amy, you're on the couch.",S01E23,243
"Teddy enters from over there. Now remember, guys,",S01E23,244
This is just a rehearsal so use your scripts.,S01E23,245
And action.,S01E23,246
"Teddy, can you come here a minute?",S01E23,247
"Teddy crosses to the couch, nervous.",S01E23,248
'Am I in trouble' question mark.,S01E23,249
"No no no, kimmy, just the lines, honey.",S01E23,250
"Not the other stuff, okay?",S01E23,251
And action.,S01E23,252
"Teddy, we need to talk to you.",S01E23,253
Am I in trouble?,S01E23,254
"Well, I'll just say it.",S01E23,255
"- Your mother's gonna have a baby.   - Okay, can we stop?",S01E23,256
Can we stop? I'm sorry.,S01E23,257
These words they just don't fit into my mouth comfortably.,S01E23,258
But it's what happened.,S01E23,259
It's exactly what you said.,S01E23,260
The day you were supposed to be wearing scrubs.,S01E23,261
"Okay, valid point, but do we want to make it real.",S01E23,262
Or do we want to make it good?,S01E23,263
I want to make it before my battery dies.,S01E23,264
Yeah.,S01E23,265
"Well, that new bike sure is a beauty.",S01E23,266
"Sure is, dad.",S01E23,267
- All right.,S01E23,268
Have fun.,S01E23,269
- Okay.,S01E23,270
"- Gabe, before you go - Yeah?",S01E23,271
- One quick question.,S01E23,272
- Mm-hmm.,S01E23,273
You know that garage door remote that charlie had?,S01E23,274
- Mm-hmm. - How do you think she got that down from the cupboard?,S01E23,275
"- Maybe you should ask charlie.  - Yeah, well,",S01E23,276
You know I can't do that.,S01E23,277
"Oh, because she can't talk yet.",S01E23,278
- Yeah.,S01E23,279
"- Yeah, that is a bummer.",S01E23,280
"Yeah, it sure is.",S01E23,281
All right.,S01E23,282
You know what? I'll see you later.,S01E23,283
Okay.,S01E23,284
You know what? Just one more thing.,S01E23,285
Mm-hmm.,S01E23,286
"You know, I don't even think.",S01E23,287
That remote works from the kitchen where charlie was.,S01E23,288
"Dad, what are you trying to say?",S01E23,289
Are you accusing me of something?,S01E23,290
"No, I just wanna know when you're gonna be back.",S01E23,291
"Oh, half an hour. Can I go now?",S01E23,292
"Of course you can, gabe.",S01E23,293
You've always been free to go.,S01E23,294
Okay.,S01E23,295
"Okay okay, there she is.",S01E23,296
Now I'm going to prove to you that she likes me.,S01E23,297
- And not you.,S01E23,298
- Okay.,S01E23,299
Okay.,S01E23,300
- Hi.,S01E23,301
- Hi.,S01E23,302
- Hi.,S01E23,303
- Hi.,S01E23,304
So far it's a tie.,S01E23,305
"Okay, I know we both have a lot to offer,",S01E23,306
But you're gonna have to choose between us.,S01E23,307
"Oh, I choose P.",S01E23,308
J.,S01E23,309
"Okay, let's try that again.",S01E23,310
And remember it's a multiple-choice question.,S01E23,311
My choice is still P.,S01E23,312
J.,S01E23,313
"I'm sorry, I can't go out with you.",S01E23,314
I wouldn't do that to emmett.,S01E23,315
Pals before gals.,S01E23,316
"- Thanks, man. - You'd do the same for me, right?",S01E23,317
"Yeah, let's go with that.",S01E23,318
Wait a minute.,S01E23,319
I know what's going on here.,S01E23,320
- You think I'm nina.  - You're not?,S01E23,321
No! I'm tina.,S01E23,322
That's nina.,S01E23,323
Twins!,S01E23,324
Wait. What are we doing?,S01E23,325
"And then I could say,",S01E23,326
"Teddy girl, mama's having a baby child!",S01E23,327
Right? Right? Isn't that better?,S01E23,328
Doesn't it make more sense.,S01E23,329
That Amy would tell Teddy about the baby?,S01E23,330
Mama's having a baby child?,S01E23,331
"Well, teddy, I'm just trying to find.",S01E23,332
The emotional truth to the piece.,S01E23,333
No thank you.,S01E23,334
"Okay, fine.",S01E23,335
"You want me to be a robot, I'll be a robot.",S01E23,336
I'll be a robot.,S01E23,337
Am I in trouble?,S01E23,338
No.,S01E23,339
No no no no no.,S01E23,340
Nobody's a robot.,S01E23,341
We're doing the script as written.,S01E23,342
"Okay, places everyone.",S01E23,343
And action.,S01E23,344
"Teddy, can you come here a minute?",S01E23,345
Am I in trouble?,S01E23,346
"Teddy, we need to talk to you.",S01E23,347
"Well, I'll just say it",S01E23,348
Your mother's gonna have a baby.,S01E23,349
A what?,S01E23,350
A baby.,S01E23,351
You're gonna have.,S01E23,352
A new little brother or sister.,S01E23,353
- Oh! - Now what are you doing?,S01E23,354
I just felt the baby kick.,S01E23,355
No.,S01E23,356
No no no.,S01E23,357
That's impossible.,S01E23,358
The baby doesn't have feet yet.,S01E23,359
Okay.,S01E23,360
You know what? I'm just trying.,S01E23,361
To figure out the mix of emotions that I was feeling that day.,S01E23,362
"You know, the excitement, the confusion,",S01E23,363
"The fear, the hormones.",S01E23,364
"Yeah, do you know what I was feeling that day?",S01E23,365
It was why are you having another baby?,S01E23,366
You barely have time for the three kids you have now.,S01E23,367
Was that in the script? Because I'm lost.,S01E23,368
"Teddy honey,",S01E23,369
What was that?,S01E23,370
"I'm sorry, mom.",S01E23,371
I shouldn't have said that.,S01E23,372
"Well, is that really how you felt?",S01E23,373
Were you really mad that we were having another baby?,S01E23,374
"- Yeah, I kinda was.  - Why didn't you say something?",S01E23,375
"Mom, what was I supposed to say?",S01E23,376
Charlie was on the way.,S01E23,377
You were all so excited.,S01E23,378
Excited? I didn't know how we were gonna make it all work.,S01E23,379
- I was terrified.,S01E23,380
- Really? Cause you didn't show it.,S01E23,381
That's because I'm a really great actress.,S01E23,382
Come here.,S01E23,383
Sit down.,S01E23,384
"Do you still feel that way,",S01E23,385
Like we don't have enough time for you?,S01E23,386
"Actually, today I thought maybe you had.",S01E23,387
A little bit too much time for me.,S01E23,388
"No. Seriously,",S01E23,389
"I don't know how you're doing it,",S01E23,390
But you guys are doing a great job.,S01E23,391
"Well, that's because we're not doing it alone,",S01E23,392
And one of the big reasons it works is you.,S01E23,393
The boys help out too.,S01E23,394
"But you're right, it's mostly me.",S01E23,395
"Look, teddy. In the future,",S01E23,396
"If ever you're feeling something, you've got to tell me, okay?",S01E23,397
Come here.,S01E23,398
Come here.,S01E23,399
I want us to always be honest with each other.,S01E23,400
"Okay, I'll be honest with you.",S01E23,401
Say the lines as written or you're fired.,S01E23,402
Aww.,S01E23,403
"What's the matter, gabe?",S01E23,404
"- Um, dad   - Are you okay?",S01E23,405
You look shook up.,S01E23,406
- Wheelie's back.  - I know! Isn't it great?,S01E23,407
Yay. Um,S01E23,408
How did you find him?,S01E23,409
"Oh, I came home from work,",S01E23,410
"I saw that kid Jake on your bike,",S01E23,411
So I called the cops and they arrested him.,S01E23,412
They arrested Jake?,S01E23,413
But he's just a kid.,S01E23,414
"Ooh, he won't be when he gets out.",S01E23,415
"- What?   - What's wrong, son?",S01E23,416
Something bothering you?,S01E23,417
Um No.,S01E23,418
"No? Well, something's bothering me,",S01E23,419
Because here's what I think really happened.,S01E23,420
"First, you sold your bike to Jake",S01E23,421
And then you pocketed the money.,S01E23,422
Then you opened the garage door,S01E23,423
Using the keypad.,S01E23,424
"Finally, you grabbed the remote",S01E23,425
From the kitchen cabinet,S01E23,426
And you planted it on charlie.,S01E23,427
"Interesting theory, but it doesn't prove a thing.",S01E23,428
You're right.,S01E23,429
You're right.,S01E23,430
"I didn't have any hard proof,",S01E23,431
"But I kept thinking, thinking.",S01E23,432
And thinking.,S01E23,433
And then a bell went off.,S01E23,434
- Is gabe here?   - No.,S01E23,435
Tell him Jake wants his $10 back.,S01E23,436
This bike is a piece of junk.,S01E23,437
And that's when all the pieces fell into place.,S01E23,438
"All right, you got me.",S01E23,439
Now what happens?,S01E23,440
Ask your mother.,S01E23,441
Back from the bike store.,S01E23,442
"Charlie, your brother has something he would like to say to you.",S01E23,443
"Go ahead, gabe.",S01E23,444
"Charlie, I'm sorry I tried to frame you.",S01E23,445
Aw. Remember the first time I said that to you?,S01E23,446
Like it was yesterday.,S01E23,447
And now here is a little I'm-sorry present from your brother.,S01E23,448
"Okay, bring it in.",S01E23,449
- Oh.  - Yay!,S01E23,450
"Yeah, we exchanged gabe's new bike for this one.",S01E23,451
- Thank you.,S01E23,452
- You're welcome.,S01E23,453
"Charlie, there you are on your very first bike.",S01E23,454
"Yeah yeah. Teddy girl,",S01E23,455
Mama's baby child has a new tricycle!,S01E23,456
It's pink and red and it's got little stickers on it.,S01E23,457
"Yup, and there's mom stealing your very first spotlight.",S01E23,458
"Good luck, charlie.",S01E23,459
I feel so bad.,S01E23,460
I just can't tell them apart.,S01E23,461
- It is hard.,S01E23,462
- And I don't want to offend them.,S01E23,463
"Well, you just have to find one little thing that's different.",S01E23,464
What do you think?,S01E23,465
"I have no idea, and I'm married to one of them.",S01E23,466
"Hey, uh, dads,",S01E23,467
Can I have five bucks?,S01E23,468
Huh.,S01E23,469
I love having two dads.,S01E23,470
Unbelievable! We'll never figure it out!,S01E23,471
Wait.,S01E23,472
Wait.,S01E23,473
Yup.,S01E23,474
That's my guy.,S01E23,475
Today's all burnt toast,S01E23,476
"Running late, and dad jokes",S01E23,477
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S01E23,478
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S01E23,479
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S01E23,480
There it is up on the roof,S01E23,481
"I've been there, I've survived",S01E23,482
So just take my advice,S01E23,483
"Hang in there, baby, ",S01E23,484
Things are crazy,S01E23,485
But I know your future is bright,S01E23,486
"Hang in there, baby",S01E23,487
There is no maybe,S01E23,488
Everything turns out all right,S01E23,489
Sure life is up and down,S01E23,490
"But trust me, it comes back around",S01E23,491
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S01E23,492
"Hang in there, baby.",S01E23,493
-Right down the middle.,S01E24,0
Right here.,S01E24,1
-Okay.,S01E24,2
-There we go. -Nice!,S01E24,3
-Throw again.,S01E24,4
"- Kids, listen up.",S01E24,5
Big news.,S01E24,6
Please tell us you're not having another baby.,S01E24,7
"No, we're not having another baby.",S01E24,8
"And I can assure you,",S01E24,9
we will not be making that announcement ever again.,S01E24,10
"Yeah, this family is big enough.",S01E24,11
"Hey, you completely clear on that, dad?",S01E24,12
Why you pointin' your finger at me?,S01E24,13
Having babies is a team effort.,S01E24,14
What do you mean?,S01E24,15
This should be good.,S01E24,16
Uh,S01E24,17
You know what? Getting back to that big announcement,S01E24,18
We're going on a family vacation!,S01E24,19
And it's our first one with Charlie.,S01E24,20
And Gabe.,S01E24,21
What are you talking about? You've been on lots of vacations.,S01E24,22
"Okay, visiting",S01E24,23
grandma after she had the fat sucked out of her butt.,S01E24,24
Is not a vacation.,S01E24,25
"Okay, this time we are going on a real vacation.",S01E24,26
To a ski resort in the mountains.,S01E24,27
"Oh, and here's an interesting piece of family history",S01E24,28
The place is called mount bliss.,S01E24,29
And it happens to be,S01E24,30
 Where your dad and I got married.,S01E24,31
It's very romantic.,S01E24,32
"Honey, you just interrupted me.",S01E24,33
"I was just trying to get to the point, Bob.",S01E24,34
You know your stories go on forever.,S01E24,35
And the romance continues.,S01E24,36
"You know, the weekend we got married,",S01E24,37
We weren't even planning on doing it.,S01E24,38
Getting married.,S01E24,39
Then we met judge Lawson,S01E24,40
and he said we were perfect for each other.,S01E24,41
-So we did it.,S01E24,42
-Got married.,S01E24,43
Why do you keep saying that?,S01E24,44
Haven't you had the talk with him yet?,S01E24,45
I haven't had the talk with P.,S01E24,46
J.,S01E24,47
Yet.,S01E24,48
I'm good.,S01E24,49
Today's all burnt toast,S01E24,50
"running late, and dad jokes",S01E24,51
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S01E24,52
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S01E24,53
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S01E24,54
There it is up on the roof,S01E24,55
"I've been there, I've survived",S01E24,56
So just take my advice,S01E24,57
"Hang in there, baby,",S01E24,58
Things are crazy,S01E24,59
But I know your future is bright,S01E24,60
"Hang in there, Baby",S01E24,61
There is no maybe,S01E24,62
Eveything turns out all right,S01E24,63
Sure life is up and down,S01E24,64
"But trust me, it comes back all around",S01E24,65
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S01E24,66
"Hang in there, Baby",S01E24,67
"Oh, isn't it beautiful?",S01E24,68
A lot of good memories here.,S01E24,69
More to come.,S01E24,70
"It's gonna be like this the whole week, isn't it?",S01E24,71
"All right, why don't you kids have a seat while we check in?",S01E24,72
"Hey, P.",S01E24,73
J.,S01E24,74
", I have to go to the bathroom.",S01E24,75
-Can you come with me? -Aren't you a little old for that?,S01E24,76
I put my ski pants on backwards.,S01E24,77
First vacation's always the hardest.,S01E24,78
Whoa.,S01E24,79
I am getting a very powerful vibe from you.,S01E24,80
Oh sorry.,S01E24,81
I've been sitting in a hot minivan for four hours.,S01E24,82
"Oh, sweetie, no.",S01E24,83
No no no.,S01E24,84
I mean I'm a psychic.,S01E24,85
-Really? You're a psychic? -Yeah.,S01E24,86
"'cause, no offense, but you kind of look like a normal person.",S01E24,87
Did you know I was gonna say that?,S01E24,88
Did you know I was gonna say that?,S01E24,89
It doesn't work that way.,S01E24,90
"And yes, I did.",S01E24,91
Would you like a free reading?,S01E24,92
You tell me.,S01E24,93
I'll give you one anyway.,S01E24,94
Give me your hands.,S01E24,95
"Oh, this trip is going.",S01E24,96
To be a very important one for you.,S01E24,97
I'm seeing you will have two left feet.,S01E24,98
And that's odd.,S01E24,99
Now I see there is a bear in your room.,S01E24,100
And now I see why you give free readings in the lobby.,S01E24,101
"And finally,",S01E24,102
I see you will come face to face.,S01E24,103
With the love of your life.,S01E24,104
Oh whoa.,S01E24,105
Okay.,S01E24,106
No thanks.,S01E24,107
I I just got out of a relationship.,S01E24,108
"With this guy named Spencer,",S01E24,109
So I'm not really looking to meet anybody.,S01E24,110
You think it's up to you.,S01E24,111
That's cute.,S01E24,112
"Uh, excuse me.",S01E24,113
I have to take this.,S01E24,114
Take what?,S01E24,115
Hello?,S01E24,116
"Oh, what a surprise.",S01E24,117
Not really.,S01E24,118
"Come on, don't you want to go snowboarding?",S01E24,119
I'm doing it right now.,S01E24,120
Check this out.,S01E24,121
I just broke my neck.,S01E24,122
Sweet.,S01E24,123
So what are you gonna do all day?,S01E24,124
Room service!,S01E24,125
Does that answer your question?,S01E24,126
"Your order, sir.",S01E24,127
"French fries, potato chips and onion rings a la mode.",S01E24,128
Mr. Starkwell?,S01E24,129
Gabe.,S01E24,130
You two know each other?,S01E24,131
Mr.,S01E24,132
Starkwell was my third-grade teacher.,S01E24,133
Gabe is the reason I quit teaching.,S01E24,134
And he's the reason I went to summer school.,S01E24,135
You went to summer school because you've got a mouth on you,S01E24,136
Sir.,S01E24,137
"Hey, remember me?",S01E24,138
Did I have you for third grade too?,S01E24,139
Yeah.,S01E24,140
We had two great years together.,S01E24,141
"Well, looks like the foot's on the other shoe now, isn't it?",S01E24,142
Don't you mean the shoe is on the other foot?,S01E24,143
"Your days of correcting me are over, Marvin.",S01E24,144
"Oh, this is gonna be fun.",S01E24,145
What? Oh no.,S01E24,146
I brought two left boots by mistake.,S01E24,147
Wait two left feet.,S01E24,148
"-Huh, that's weird. -What's weird?",S01E24,149
"Well, I met this psychic in the lobby.",S01E24,150
And she made some crazy predictions.,S01E24,151
But one of them just kind of came true.,S01E24,152
"I went to a psychic once. She was dead on about me,",S01E24,153
Said I was gonna be famous.,S01E24,154
But that hasn't come true.,S01E24,155
Yet.,S01E24,156
But mine was crazy.,S01E24,157
She said I'd come face to face with the love of my life.,S01E24,158
"Well, it could happen, Teddy.",S01E24,159
Mount bliss is a magical place.,S01E24,160
"Well, don't get too excited.",S01E24,161
She also said there would be a bear in my room.,S01E24,162
Oh! Run for your lives!,S01E24,163
"Okay, that's just weird.",S01E24,164
Really? I thought it was kinda cute.,S01E24,165
"All right, we'll go take it back.",S01E24,166
Wow.,S01E24,167
I could look at that view forever.,S01E24,168
"Okay, that's enough.",S01E24,169
Hmm.,S01E24,170
Never seen this trail before.,S01E24,171
Cool.,S01E24,172
"All right, yeah!",S01E24,173
Ahhh!,S01E24,174
Am I in heaven?,S01E24,175
-Hello.,S01E24,176
-Hi.,S01E24,177
Bye!,S01E24,178
Hey. Hey honey? Guess what?,S01E24,179
We're not actually married. Would you like to grab some lunch?,S01E24,180
What did you just say?,S01E24,181
You want to grab some lunch?,S01E24,182
"No, before that.",S01E24,183
"Oh, it turns out our wedding ceremony wasn't actually valid.",S01E24,184
You feel like mexican?,S01E24,185
What do you mean we're not actually married?,S01E24,186
"Whoa whoa, I was asking around about judge Lawson.",S01E24,187
And the guy at the front desk tells me,S01E24,188
he was like some kind of con man.,S01E24,189
Apparently he did fake marriages all the time.,S01E24,190
But he said we were perfect for each other.,S01E24,191
Apparently it was just part of his scam.,S01E24,192
"You know, there's this great fondue place I read about.",S01E24,193
Would you stop talking about food?,S01E24,194
"This is serious. I mean, we're not really married?",S01E24,195
"Well, according to the universe,",S01E24,196
"of course we are, honey.",S01E24,197
"According to the state of Colorado, not so much.",S01E24,198
"-Oh hey, psychic lady! -Oh hi.",S01E24,199
So I've been looking around all day for the love of my life.,S01E24,200
And I haven't found him yet. So when's that gonna happen?,S01E24,201
"Oh gosh, I don't know.",S01E24,202
Psychic prediction is not an exact science.,S01E24,203
Ha! It's not a science at all.,S01E24,204
Right. Can I at least have a little more info?,S01E24,205
Like is he hot or not?,S01E24,206
"Not that it matters, but please say hot.",S01E24,207
All I can tell you is keep your eyes open.,S01E24,208
Okay.,S01E24,209
"Well, they're open.",S01E24,210
And they're starting to see that this is a bunch of,S01E24,211
Hi.,S01E24,212
Hi.,S01E24,213
I'm Teddy.,S01E24,214
I'm Brandon.,S01E24,215
Wow.,S01E24,216
So I guess it's true.,S01E24,217
What's true?,S01E24,218
"Well, you I mean, us.",S01E24,219
"I mean, I didn't believe it,",S01E24,220
"but then I had two left boots,",S01E24,221
"Which aren't actually feet,",S01E24,222
but they're where feet go in.,S01E24,223
When you need something to walk in.,S01E24,224
"So in a sense, they're feet.",S01E24,225
"-What? -Okay okay,",S01E24,226
I probably sound a little bit crazy right now.,S01E24,227
But you would too if a psychic told you,S01E24,228
"there was a bear in your room,",S01E24,229
Which there was sort of.,S01E24,230
"Oh, and in my room, not in your room.",S01E24,231
I don't know anything about your room.,S01E24,232
I'm gonna go now.,S01E24,233
I'm not crazy.,S01E24,234
"Seriously, I'm not crazy!",S01E24,235
For dinner I would like the lobster thermometer.,S01E24,236
It's lobster thermidor.,S01E24,237
What did I say about correcting me?,S01E24,238
"That if I did it again, you were going to",S01E24,239
"Well, I can't say I didn't warn you.",S01E24,240
Now chop chop and get me my lobster.,S01E24,241
"I know this is none of my business,",S01E24,242
But you're running up quite a bill here.,S01E24,243
What do you mean?,S01E24,244
"You don't know what room service is, do you?",S01E24,245
Yeah.,S01E24,246
I want things and you bring them to me.,S01E24,247
For an additional charge.,S01E24,248
"Wait, it costs money?",S01E24,249
A lot of money.,S01E24,250
Shall we see how much money?,S01E24,251
"Let's go to my favorite channel,",S01E24,252
The bill channel.,S01E24,253
Oh mama!,S01E24,254
$300?!,S01E24,255
I don't have that kind of money.,S01E24,256
Looks like you're in quite a pickle,S01E24,257
"which, by the way, are $8.",S01E24,258
Mom and dad are gonna ground me forever.,S01E24,259
Perhaps we can make some kind of arrangement.,S01E24,260
What do you mean?,S01E24,261
I have to be a bellman?,S01E24,262
Bellboy.,S01E24,263
How's the cocoa?,S01E24,264
Are you warming up?,S01E24,265
Am I in heaven?,S01E24,266
Why does he keep saying that?,S01E24,267
I don't know.,S01E24,268
But it's so cute.,S01E24,269
"So this is your cabin, huh?",S01E24,270
Yep.,S01E24,271
We don't get a lot of visitors.,S01E24,272
Especially ones with sparkling blue eyes.,S01E24,273
And beautiful blonde hair.,S01E24,274
This is a lucky day for everyone.,S01E24,275
Do you need to call your family,S01E24,276
and let them know you're okay?,S01E24,277
"Nah, I'm good.",S01E24,278
So you girls live here alone?,S01E24,279
"-No, our pa lives with us.",S01E24,280
-Oh.,S01E24,281
-But he's away on business.,S01E24,282
-Oh.,S01E24,283
Why did you go down the wrong side of the mountain?,S01E24,284
Because,S01E24,285
-Do you girls get T.,S01E24,286
V.,S01E24,287
Here? -No.,S01E24,288
I'm training to defend my olympic gold medal.,S01E24,289
Wow.,S01E24,290
That's amazing.,S01E24,291
"You poor baby, you're freezing.",S01E24,292
I want to run him a hot bath.,S01E24,293
-I will.,S01E24,294
"-No, I will.",S01E24,295
"Oh girls, girls.",S01E24,296
I'm gonna need more than one bath.,S01E24,297
"Hey, mom, can I borrow your pink scarf?",S01E24,298
"Sure, honey. Why are you all dolled up?",S01E24,299
Because I think I may have met the love of my life.,S01E24,300
"Except I acted crazy and scared him away,",S01E24,301
So now I have to get super cute and hang out in the lobby.,S01E24,302
So he can fall in love with me.,S01E24,303
"Mom, I've got to tell you, he is the perfect guy.",S01E24,304
"Well, okay, tell me all about him.",S01E24,305
Okay.,S01E24,306
"Well, he's really cute.",S01E24,307
His name is Brandon.,S01E24,308
And that's all I know.,S01E24,309
He does sound perfect.,S01E24,310
"Hey, honey.",S01E24,311
Hey.,S01E24,312
Why aren't you dressed? I thought we were going skiing.,S01E24,313
"No, change of plans.",S01E24,314
The front desk found a justice of the peace.,S01E24,315
Who's going to marry us this afternoon.,S01E24,316
What are you talking about?,S01E24,317
"Um, honey.",S01E24,318
I want you to brace yourself.,S01E24,319
Okay? Your father and I aren't actually married.,S01E24,320
Oh my gosh.,S01E24,321
I forgot to floss.,S01E24,322
-So should we go get married? -Yeah.,S01E24,323
But can't it wait till we get home?,S01E24,324
"Well, I just thought it would be really romantic and special.",S01E24,325
If we did it here,S01E24,326
"You know, where we thought we did it 19 years ago.",S01E24,327
But I already bought the lift tickets.,S01E24,328
"Oh, come on, honey! We're on vacation.",S01E24,329
"Come on, I want to enjoy myself.",S01E24,330
Oh okay.,S01E24,331
So being married to me.,S01E24,332
Isn't something you'd enjoy?,S01E24,333
I'm not enjoying it right now.,S01E24,334
"Fine, don't marry me then.",S01E24,335
"Well, all right, fine.",S01E24,336
I won't.,S01E24,337
You won't last five minutes without me.,S01E24,338
Oh yeah? You just watch me.,S01E24,339
-Have you seen that -It's around your neck.,S01E24,340
Thank you.,S01E24,341
"Starting right now, baby!",S01E24,342
Tell us more about your gold medal.,S01E24,343
"Well, it's gold.",S01E24,344
And it's made out of metal.,S01E24,345
Can we get you anything else?,S01E24,346
"Yeah. Why don't you get some marshmallows,",S01E24,347
Some chocolate and some Graham crackers?,S01E24,348
-What for? -So we can make s'mores.,S01E24,349
What are those?,S01E24,350
"Girls, girls, girls,",S01E24,351
There's so much I have to teach you.,S01E24,352
-I'll get them.,S01E24,353
"-No, I'll get them.",S01E24,354
-I'll get them! -Ah!,S01E24,355
Whoa! Who are you?,S01E24,356
Who are you?,S01E24,357
I asked you first.,S01E24,358
I don't like boys sniffing around my girls.,S01E24,359
You must be pa.,S01E24,360
Wow.,S01E24,361
You're bigger than everything.,S01E24,362
Get out.,S01E24,363
My thoughts exactly.,S01E24,364
Is that my robe?,S01E24,365
Oh whoopsie.,S01E24,366
Here you go.,S01E24,367
"Nice to meet you, sir.",S01E24,368
Enjoy your s'mores.,S01E24,369
Bye.,S01E24,370
"Yeah, if mommy's gonna be single,",S01E24,371
You're gonna be single too.,S01E24,372
"Hey, honey, still looking for the love of your life?",S01E24,373
"Yeah, and I can't find him anywhere.",S01E24,374
"Mom, what if I only had one chance",S01E24,375
and I blew it?,S01E24,376
I've been feeling exactly the same way.,S01E24,377
What?,S01E24,378
Because dad and I aren't actually married.,S01E24,379
And he didn't want to marry me again.,S01E24,380
"I know I'm putting up a brave front,",S01E24,381
But I'm really hurting.,S01E24,382
"Oh, maybe that's him!",S01E24,383
"Hey, what's up? How's it going?",S01E24,384
"Listen, if a big scary guy",S01E24,385
"with a beard shows up,",S01E24,386
I'm not here.,S01E24,387
-Room service.,S01E24,388
"-Yeah, come on in.",S01E24,389
"Honey, food's here.",S01E24,390
-Wow. -What?,S01E24,391
Aren't you a little young to be working?,S01E24,392
I got myself into some trouble.,S01E24,393
Did you know that room service is extra?,S01E24,394
-Everyone knows that.,S01E24,395
"-Not everyone, my friend.",S01E24,396
Great great. Do you mind setting it up over there?,S01E24,397
"And if you could toss the salad, that would be great.",S01E24,398
"My wife will be right out, okay?",S01E24,399
"Uh, sure.",S01E24,400
Ech!,S01E24,401
-What did you do? -I tossed the salad.,S01E24,402
"No, you've made a mess.",S01E24,403
Get out of here.,S01E24,404
I have to open the cider.,S01E24,405
Ow! My eye!,S01E24,406
"I'm gonna go get you a washcloth, okay?",S01E24,407
"If you need anything else, my name is Marvin.",S01E24,408
"I assure you, sir,",S01E24,409
"when we find this person, they'll be dealt with severely.",S01E24,410
Impersonating a bellman is a serious offense.,S01E24,411
"Well, time to go skiing.",S01E24,412
-Whoa.,S01E24,413
-Hi.,S01E24,414
I it's so weird running into you.,S01E24,415
I haven't been looking for you.,S01E24,416
"Okay, I see you have that scared look in your eye.",S01E24,417
"And you're probably gonna bolt any second,",S01E24,418
"So before you do that,",S01E24,419
Can we just start over?,S01E24,420
Sure.,S01E24,421
"Hey, why don't I grab us some hot cocoa.",S01E24,422
And you find us somewhere to sit?,S01E24,423
P.,S01E24,424
S.,S01E24,425
I look really great next to fires.,S01E24,426
-Then I'll be right here.,S01E24,427
"-Well, I'll be right back.",S01E24,428
-Whoa.,S01E24,429
-Hi.,S01E24,430
Hi.,S01E24,431
I'm Justin.,S01E24,432
"Oh no, we're face to face.",S01E24,433
Yeah.,S01E24,434
"Yeah, we are.",S01E24,435
But I already was face to face.,S01E24,436
I can't be face to face to face.,S01E24,437
"Wait, what?",S01E24,438
"Well, you were supposed to be him,",S01E24,439
but now I guess it could be you.,S01E24,440
You know what? I need to talk to my psychic.,S01E24,441
I'll be right back.,S01E24,442
Sorry.,S01E24,443
Teddy.,S01E24,444
Spencer.,S01E24,445
Next time on Good luck Charlie,S01E24,446
Where are we going to find $500?,S01E24,447
This is your last chance to sign up.,S01E24,448
For the ice-dancing contest.,S01E24,449
Grand prize $500.,S01E24,450
We'll be lucky to finish second.,S01E24,451
-There are only two teams.,S01E24,452
-So you're following me.,S01E24,453
Ah!,S01E24,454
Why do I have a new room?,S01E24,455
Because you and I are not legally married.,S01E24,456
And since it would apparently inconvenience you,S01E24,457
"to marry me again,",S01E24,458
You'll be lodging elsewhere.,S01E24,459
She said I'd come face to face,S01E24,460
with the love of my life on this trip.,S01E24,461
"And so far I've met Brandon,",S01E24,462
Justin and Spencer.,S01E24,463
There's something I really need to tell you face to face.,S01E24,464
"No, don't say face to face.",S01E24,465
Last time on Good luck Charlie,S01E25,0
We're going on a family vacation!,S01E25,1
You will come face to face with the love of your life.,S01E25,2
"Hey, honey, guess what?",S01E25,3
We're not actually married.,S01E25,4
Would you like to grab some lunch?,S01E25,5
-I haven't found him yet.,S01E25,6
-All I can tell you is.,S01E25,7
-Keep your eyes open.,S01E25,8
-They're open.,S01E25,9
They're starting to see that this is a bunch of,S01E25,10
Whoa!,S01E25,11
I'm sorry.,S01E25,12
Teddy.,S01E25,13
Spencer?,S01E25,14
Hi.,S01E25,15
"Hey, what are you doing here?",S01E25,16
"Well, actually I came here to see you.",S01E25,17
Oh no. Why'd you do that?,S01E25,18
Because I've been thinking about you.,S01E25,19
And there's something I need to say.,S01E25,20
Just please don't.,S01E25,21
It can't be you.,S01E25,22
-What can't be me? -It!,S01E25,23
How much clearer can I be?,S01E25,24
-Will you at least listen to me? -I can't right now.,S01E25,25
I'm really busy busy busy.,S01E25,26
"Okay, but, Teddy",S01E25,27
la la la la la,S01E25,28
"See you later, Justin. la la la la",S01E25,29
"See you later, Brandon.",S01E25,30
la la la la la.,S01E25,31
Today's all burnt toast,S01E25,32
"running late, and dad jokes",S01E25,33
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S01E25,34
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S01E25,35
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S01E25,36
There it is up on the roof,S01E25,37
"I've been there, I've survived",S01E25,38
So just take my advice,S01E25,39
"Hang in there, baby,",S01E25,40
Things are crazy,S01E25,41
But I know your future is bright,S01E25,42
"Hang in there, Baby",S01E25,43
There is no maybe,S01E25,44
Eveything turns out all right,S01E25,45
Sure life is up and down,S01E25,46
"But trust me, it comes back all around",S01E25,47
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S01E25,48
"Hang in there, Baby",S01E25,49
"Hi, honey.",S01E25,50
I got off work early and made your favorite dinner.,S01E25,51
I am so lucky to be married to you.,S01E25,52
"As my mom always says to my dad,",S01E25,53
"Yes, you are.",S01E25,54
"Hi, honey.",S01E25,55
How's my beautiful wife today?,S01E25,56
"Wait, but",S01E25,57
"-But I thought -Hi, honey.",S01E25,58
"Oh, you made Brandon's favorite dinner.",S01E25,59
Wait a minute.,S01E25,60
Am I married to you.,S01E25,61
Or you or you?,S01E25,62
Yes.,S01E25,63
You couldn't decide which one of us was the love of your life.,S01E25,64
-So you married all of us.,S01E25,65
-But that's crazy.,S01E25,66
I'll tell you what's crazy,S01E25,67
It's 10 years later and I haven't grown at all.,S01E25,68
"Ivy, I'm up here at the ski lodge and-and I met.",S01E25,69
This psychic who said I'd meet the love of my life.,S01E25,70
And so I met the guy,S01E25,71
"but then I met another guy,",S01E25,72
And then you won't believe who showed up.,S01E25,73
And so that makes three guys and-and I need your help.,S01E25,74
Oh sorry.,S01E25,75
This is Teddy.,S01E25,76
"When we get to the top, mind if I go first?",S01E25,77
You're kinda slow.,S01E25,78
Excuse me?,S01E25,79
I've seen you board.,S01E25,80
And I've also seen my grandma board.,S01E25,81
Kind of the same thing.,S01E25,82
-Better than you. -Oh yeah?!,S01E25,83
Care to put your money where your mouth is?,S01E25,84
"Nope! Last time I did that, a quarter froze to my lip.",S01E25,85
I mean do you want to make a bet?,S01E25,86
100 bucks says I beat you to the bottom.,S01E25,87
"Oh, it is on.",S01E25,88
The only reason you won is because,S01E25,89
I hit a wicked patch of ice.,S01E25,90
Then I guess you have no problem making it double or nothing.,S01E25,91
Bring it.,S01E25,92
"Hey, look what Charlie got.",S01E25,93
A present from that little toddler she has a crush on.,S01E25,94
-That's nice.,S01E25,95
-I guess some men know how to treat their women.,S01E25,96
"-You seen my luggage? -Yes, I have.",S01E25,97
-Do you want to tell me where it is? -Sure.,S01E25,98
It's in your room,S01E25,99
Your new room.,S01E25,100
Why do I have a new room?,S01E25,101
"Well, because you and I are not legally married.",S01E25,102
And since it would apparently inconvenience you.,S01E25,103
"To marry me again, you'll be lodging elsewhere.",S01E25,104
-Oh come on! -Mm-hmm.,S01E25,105
"As a single woman,",S01E25,106
I don't feel comfortable having a strange man in my room.,S01E25,107
"-Amy Duncan, you're a piece of work. -Ah ah!",S01E25,108
Amy blankenhooper.,S01E25,109
You're going back to your maiden name?,S01E25,110
"Yes, I am.",S01E25,111
Mm-hmm.,S01E25,112
"To tell you the truth, I've always preferred blankenhooper.",S01E25,113
Yeah? What is it you like most about it?,S01E25,114
That people laugh so hard when they say it.,S01E25,115
Or just that they can't spell it?,S01E25,116
"Get out, Bob.",S01E25,117
"Hey, T!",S01E25,118
"Oh, Ivy, I'm so glad you made it.",S01E25,119
You can lower your arms now.,S01E25,120
Don't you think I would if I could?,S01E25,121
Why do you have so many layers on?,S01E25,122
Ivy doesn't do cold.,S01E25,123
So what's the big emergency?,S01E25,124
"Well, I met this psychic.",S01E25,125
"Oh, so you did say psychic.",S01E25,126
I thought we were in a bad cell zone.,S01E25,127
"Anyway, she said I'd come face to face",S01E25,128
"with the love of my life on this trip,",S01E25,129
"And so far I've met Brandon, Justin and",S01E25,130
-Spencer. -Spencer?,S01E25,131
The two-timing dog that cheated on you?,S01E25,132
"-Yep, that's the one. -No!",S01E25,133
That's not the one.,S01E25,134
"I mean, so who are these other boys?",S01E25,135
"Oh, there there's one right now.",S01E25,136
That's Justin.,S01E25,137
"Oh, he's cute! So what do you know about him?",S01E25,138
That he's cute.,S01E25,139
"Well, I've only had one day.",S01E25,140
All I need is one minute.,S01E25,141
"Yo, Justin!",S01E25,142
"Teddy, hi.",S01E25,143
"Hi, Justin.",S01E25,144
This is my best friend Ivy.,S01E25,145
"How you doing, Justin. You a skier?",S01E25,146
"-Yeah, I sure am.",S01E25,147
-Oh great.,S01E25,148
One other thing.,S01E25,149
-Does your family have money? -Ivy!,S01E25,150
Sorry.,S01E25,151
I actually didn't catch your answer.,S01E25,152
That's cause I didn't throw it yet.,S01E25,153
-P.,S01E25,154
J.,S01E25,155
! -I need to borrow some money!.,S01E25,156
What did you say?,S01E25,157
I need to borrow some money! Stop that!,S01E25,158
"-All right, me first.",S01E25,159
-Okay.,S01E25,160
I lost a bet and I need $200.,S01E25,161
I need $300. Did you know hotels charge for room service?,S01E25,162
"Sure, everyone knows that.",S01E25,163
Did you know I'm a terrible snowboarder?,S01E25,164
"Sure, everyone knows that.",S01E25,165
-We really should have talked earlier.,S01E25,166
-Yeah.,S01E25,167
"Man, where are we gonna find $500?",S01E25,168
"Attention, guests, this is your last chance.",S01E25,169
To sign up for the ice-dancing contest.,S01E25,170
Grand prize $500.,S01E25,171
That was convenient.,S01E25,172
Just one problem we don't know how to ice dance.,S01E25,173
Remember this is an amateur contest.,S01E25,174
You do not need to know how to ice dance.,S01E25,175
You're so funny.,S01E25,176
"Hi, Bob.",S01E25,177
Didn't see you there.,S01E25,178
-Who's your friend? -Some guy I met.,S01E25,179
Ah. What's his name?,S01E25,180
"Well, it's not Duncan, that's for sure.",S01E25,181
"Yep, been there, done that.",S01E25,182
You know two can play at this game.,S01E25,183
"Hiya, doll.",S01E25,184
I don't want to play this game.,S01E25,185
So you want to be a chef and a swimsuit model.,S01E25,186
That's a good combination.,S01E25,187
How do we know he's qualified?,S01E25,188
Can you cook us something?,S01E25,189
-With your shirt off? -Ivy!,S01E25,190
She's just kidding.,S01E25,191
Unless you want to.,S01E25,192
"Hi, mommy.",S01E25,193
I'm in the lobby with some girls.,S01E25,194
"No, they're not prettier than you.",S01E25,195
"Okay, 0 for 2.",S01E25,196
"So if it's not Brandon and it's not Justin,",S01E25,197
"-Then that means -No, don't say Spencer!",S01E25,198
It cannot be Spencer. I don't want it to be Spencer!,S01E25,199
I was gonna say that means,S01E25,200
"I came all the way up here for nothing,",S01E25,201
"But yeah, let's keep it on you.",S01E25,202
"So that's ice dancing, huh?",S01E25,203
It looked hard!,S01E25,204
Maybe we should go back to the lobby,S01E25,205
and see if there's another $500 contest.,S01E25,206
"Come on, we can do this.",S01E25,207
We just gotta work out a routine.,S01E25,208
"Um, okay, put your hands in the teapot position",S01E25,209
like they did in the video.,S01E25,210
Like this?,S01E25,211
-What's so funny? -Nothing.,S01E25,212
I'm ticklish.,S01E25,213
"Well, don't be!",S01E25,214
-Let's try it again.,S01E25,215
-Okay.,S01E25,216
-Stop that! -I can't help it!,S01E25,217
"Gabe, come on. If we're gonna do this thing,",S01E25,218
We have to pull together.,S01E25,219
We have to work harder.,S01E25,220
Than we've ever worked in our lives.,S01E25,221
We have to push ourselves to the absolute limit.,S01E25,222
And beyond.,S01E25,223
The contest is at 4:00.,S01E25,224
I won't kid you.,S01E25,225
It's going to be a rough hour and a half.,S01E25,226
What an awesome view.,S01E25,227
I totally agree.,S01E25,228
Oh no.,S01E25,229
"Spencer, are you following me?",S01E25,230
"Well, kinda, yeah.",S01E25,231
"Um, there's something I really need to tell you face to face.",S01E25,232
"No no, don't say face to face.",S01E25,233
"-Why not? -Look, it's complicated.",S01E25,234
Can we just please sit here quietly until the ride's over?,S01E25,235
Just no more talking.,S01E25,236
The ski lift stopped.,S01E25,237
I hear talking.,S01E25,238
One and two and three and four.,S01E25,239
"And arms arms, hands hands.",S01E25,240
"And spin, two three four.",S01E25,241
And sell it!,S01E25,242
Not bad.,S01E25,243
"Well yeah,",S01E25,244
but is not bad gonna win us $500?,S01E25,245
You're right.,S01E25,246
We need a special move.,S01E25,247
A move so good it'll blow the judges away.,S01E25,248
A move I call the cyclone of awesomeness.,S01E25,249
What's that?,S01E25,250
"I don't know, I just like the name.",S01E25,251
Maybe we could try that move we saw on the video.,S01E25,252
You mean the one where the guy threw the girl in the air?,S01E25,253
Can we just say the big one and the little one?,S01E25,254
Fine.,S01E25,255
Now put your hand on top of mine like the girl did.,S01E25,256
Little one!,S01E25,257
All right.,S01E25,258
Now I'm gonna throw you and you spin.,S01E25,259
"And while you're up there,",S01E25,260
try to do as much twirling as you can.,S01E25,261
"Out, face, cheeks,",S01E25,262
"Smile, back, spin.",S01E25,263
And throw!,S01E25,264
Whoa!,S01E25,265
I didn't see much twirling.,S01E25,266
It could be because you threw me into the wall.,S01E25,267
Try it again.,S01E25,268
Ready.,S01E25,269
"Out, face, cheeks,",S01E25,270
-Smile -What is going on in here?,S01E25,271
Brother stuff.,S01E25,272
"Oh look, Charlie, there's your little friend.",S01E25,273
"Honey, when you let the guy go,",S01E25,274
you keep the toys!,S01E25,275
-Mr.,S01E25,276
Duncan.,S01E25,277
-Miss blankenhooper.,S01E25,278
"Well, hello again.",S01E25,279
"Listen, you should know that I'm happily married.",S01E25,280
"Well, not happily.",S01E25,281
And not actually married.,S01E25,282
Tell Shirley all about it.,S01E25,283
"Look, we found out that our marriage wasn't legal,",S01E25,284
And now we're fighting,S01E25,285
because I don't want to get remarried on vacation.,S01E25,286
I think she's being completely unreasonable.,S01E25,287
"Look, doll, nobody ever said love was reasonable.",S01E25,288
And a little romantic gesture goes a long way.,S01E25,289
Thanks.,S01E25,290
That's actually pretty good advice.,S01E25,291
"If it doesn't work out, you know where to find me.",S01E25,292
Okay.,S01E25,293
I'm walking away now.,S01E25,294
Mm-mm-mm.,S01E25,295
Mama like!,S01E25,296
"Look, now that we're stuck up here,",S01E25,297
you have to listen to me.,S01E25,298
"But, Spencer, we've already talked about everything.",S01E25,299
"I miss you, Teddy.",S01E25,300
I miss us.,S01E25,301
I came up here because I want you back.,S01E25,302
"No, you cannot be the one.",S01E25,303
The one what?,S01E25,304
"Well, I met this psychic.",S01E25,305
And she told me I'd come face to face,S01E25,306
with the love of my life on this trip.,S01E25,307
And I keep running into you and,S01E25,308
"Everything else she predicted came true, but",S01E25,309
Just I'm so confused.,S01E25,310
"I'm not. Teddy, when I found out you were coming up here,",S01E25,311
Something told me I had to see you.,S01E25,312
-I don't know.,S01E25,313
-I do.,S01E25,314
And you do too.,S01E25,315
We're moving again.,S01E25,316
"Yes, we are.",S01E25,317
Are you kidding me?,S01E25,318
We'll be lucky to finish second.,S01E25,319
There are only two teams.,S01E25,320
So you're following me.,S01E25,321
"Attention, guests,",S01E25,322
The pairs skating competition will begin with our first team.,S01E25,323
P.,S01E25,324
J.,S01E25,325
And Gabrielle Duncan.,S01E25,326
It's Gabe. I'm a dude!,S01E25,327
Stop that!,S01E25,328
"One, two, three, four.",S01E25,329
"And arms arms, hands, grab.",S01E25,330
We need to do the cyclone of awesomeness.,S01E25,331
But I've never landed it.,S01E25,332
Now would be a good time to start.,S01E25,333
"Out, face, cheeks,",S01E25,334
Smile.,S01E25,335
Nailed it.,S01E25,336
And our first place winner's,S01E25,337
P.,S01E25,338
J.,S01E25,339
and Gabrielle Duncan.,S01E25,340
What's so important?,S01E25,341
"I don't know, front desk says they needed to see you.",S01E25,342
"If it's anything the Duncan kids did,",S01E25,343
I'm Amy blankenhooper.,S01E25,344
Wow.,S01E25,345
Now I know this is going to seem kind of sudden.,S01E25,346
"After the 19 years and the mortgage and all,",S01E25,347
"But, um, hang on.",S01E25,348
Would you marry me Again?,S01E25,349
"Well, Bob, I have some questions first.",S01E25,350
How many kids do you want?,S01E25,351
-Uh Four.,S01E25,352
-It's a deal.,S01E25,353
"Hey, did you hear that? We got a yes!",S01E25,354
-May I give the bride away? -I'd be honored.,S01E25,355
"Okay, Charlie, lead the way.",S01E25,356
It's not too late to back out.,S01E25,357
I love you.,S01E25,358
And I love you.,S01E25,359
"Yay, congratulations!",S01E25,360
They haven't gotten married yet.,S01E25,361
Could we move it along? I just want to get to the cake!,S01E25,362
"Oh man, I forgot to get a cake.",S01E25,363
"Attention, guests,",S01E25,364
The wedding cake baking contest has just concluded.,S01E25,365
I love this guy.,S01E25,366
"Uh, excuse me, excuse me.",S01E25,367
"Hi, everyone.",S01E25,368
Hi.,S01E25,369
"Um, I'd like to make a toast.",S01E25,370
To my husband Bob.,S01E25,371
Even after almost 20 years.,S01E25,372
"Every time we kiss, I fall in love with you all over again.",S01E25,373
And I her.,S01E25,374
That's it? At's all you got?,S01E25,375
-Hey.,S01E25,376
-Hi.,S01E25,377
That was really sweet.,S01E25,378
"Well, the first part.",S01E25,379
"Yeah, it was. Um",S01E25,380
"Listen, Spencer,",S01E25,381
I have I have to tell you something.,S01E25,382
-I really like you -I really like you too.,S01E25,383
"Uh, but the thing is",S01E25,384
"Wow, this is really hard. Um",S01E25,385
I think maybe we should just be friends.,S01E25,386
But what about all the stuff we talked about on the ski lift.,S01E25,387
And our kiss?,S01E25,388
"Well, you know how my mom said.",S01E25,389
That every time she kisses my dad she falls in love again?,S01E25,390
Yeah.,S01E25,391
"Well, when we kissed, I didn't feel that way.",S01E25,392
Oh.,S01E25,393
"I mean, I used to, but this time I didn't.",S01E25,394
I'm sorry.,S01E25,395
"Um, so what now?",S01E25,396
Friends?,S01E25,397
"-Friends. -Hey, ladies!",S01E25,398
It's time to throw the bouquet.,S01E25,399
Awwww!,S01E25,400
"Hey, so I guess you never saw the love of your life, huh?",S01E25,401
"Nope, but guess what? I'm only 15.",S01E25,402
What's the rush?,S01E25,403
You couldn't realize that before I took a four-hour bus trip?,S01E25,404
I'm just glad I don't have to think about boys for a while.,S01E25,405
-Go get his number.,S01E25,406
-I'm on it.,S01E25,407
"Well, Charlie,",S01E25,408
"we're back home from your first family vacation,",S01E25,409
Where you also went to your first wedding,S01E25,410
"Yep, mom and dad renewed their vows of love.",S01E25,411
"Okay, who is Shirley",S01E25,412
"and why is she calling here, Bob?",S01E25,413
I am in the phone book.,S01E25,414
"Yep, as you can see,",S01E25,415
everything's pretty much back to normal.,S01E25,416
How many times have I told you?!,S01E25,417
You've gotta land the triple lutz.,S01E25,418
You're killing me!,S01E25,419
"That's it, I quit!",S01E25,420
Where am I supposed to find another partner,S01E25,421
small enough to throw?,S01E25,422
"Good luck, Charlie.",S01E25,423
I hear sometimes these things get stuck.,S01E25,424
"When we get to the top, mind if I go first?",S01E25,425
I've seen you ski.,S01E25,426
You're not very good.,S01E25,427
I could flick you off here like a booger.,S01E25,428
A psychic told me I'd meet the love of my life on this trip.,S01E25,429
Did your family had money?,S01E25,430
I don't even know what money is.,S01E25,431
"Okay, Charlie, what do you say when you get in trouble?",S01E26,0
Uh-oh.,S01E26,1
"Oh, Charlie just made an uh-oh?",S01E26,2
I just changed you.,S01E26,3
"No, Charlie didn't do anything.",S01E26,4
I'm just sampling her.,S01E26,5
sampling means I'm recording all the words she says.,S01E26,6
So I can play them back.,S01E26,7
"Oh, we used to do that.",S01E26,8
We called it tape-recording.,S01E26,9
Check it out.,S01E26,10
"Mine, yes,",S01E26,11
"no,cookie, Nana.",S01E26,12
"Dad, you promised you'd take me driving today.",S01E26,13
"To be fair, I promise a lot of things I don't deliver on.",S01E26,14
"Yeah, but you can't keep putting this off.",S01E26,15
"My driver's test is in three days,and you haven't taken me out once.",S01E26,16
"No, I know, I know.",S01E26,17
You explained it all to me.,S01E26,18
While I was trying to read in the bathroom.,S01E26,19
You were outside the door while dad was in the bathroom?,S01E26,20
That's how much I want it.,S01E26,21
"Bob, take her driving already.",S01E26,22
"All right, fine.",S01E26,23
Let's go.,S01E26,24
"Boy, I tell you, nothing good ever happens when I leave the bathroom.",S01E26,25
Bye-bye.,S01E26,26
Bye bye bye-bye.,S01E26,27
- What's that?- Just in case you don't make it back.,S01E26,28
P.,S01E26,29
J.,S01E26,30
", what did you get Teddy for her birthday?.",S01E26,31
- Birthday? - Your sister's turning 16.,S01E26,32
We're having a surprise party for her tonight.,S01E26,33
"Well, it's working,",S01E26,34
'cause I'm surprised.,S01E26,35
The party starts at 7:00.,S01E26,36
"You have to get her a present,and something nice.",S01E26,37
- How about? - Not another sock puppet.,S01E26,38
You have to get her something too.,S01E26,39
"Whoa whoa, what did I just walk into?",S01E26,40
Mom says we have to buy Teddy a birthday present.,S01E26,41
What about a dog?,S01E26,42
I bet she'd like a dog.,S01E26,43
I'm serious.,S01E26,44
You have to get her something.,S01E26,45
What about a dog? I bet she'd like a dog.,S01E26,46
"Gabe, is there a dog in my house?",S01E26,47
Maybe.,S01E26,48
"He followed me home, mom.",S01E26,49
Can we keep him?,S01E26,50
No. I've told you 100 times,S01E26,51
I do not want a dog in this house.,S01E26,52
"Mom, please.",S01E26,53
Horsy.,S01E26,54
"No, honey.",S01E26,55
It's actually a doggie.,S01E26,56
Who just made a horsy-sized uh-oh.,S01E26,57
"Sorry, Teddy.",S01E26,58
I've made my decision and it's final.,S01E26,59
"Dad, that's so unfair.",S01E26,60
"Mom, dad says I can't get my license.",S01E26,61
- What? Why not?- Because she's not ready.,S01E26,62
"Well, my driving instructor thinks I am.",S01E26,63
He says I'm doing great.,S01E26,64
The man works for the public schools.,S01E26,65
He's got nothing to live for.,S01E26,66
"Mom, can you say something?",S01E26,67
"Teddy honey, I'm sorry,",S01E26,68
But your father has a very small area of authority,S01E26,69
"And unfortunately for you,",S01E26,70
Teaching you kids to drive is part of it.,S01E26,71
So what else is in that area?,S01E26,72
Barbecuing.,S01E26,73
That's it.,S01E26,74
"Dad, please.",S01E26,75
I really want to get my license the day I turn 16.,S01E26,76
"Look, it's not gonna happen, all right?",S01E26,77
"So until further notice,there's gonna be no driving.",S01E26,78
"Sorry. Can I have the keys, please?",S01E26,79
Here.,S01E26,80
I can't believe I stood outside the bathroom door for this.,S01E26,81
Hey.,S01E26,82
"You're on my side, right?",S01E26,83
- Honey. - Yeah?,S01E26,84
Why am I talking to a dog?,S01E26,85
He followed Gabe home.,S01E26,86
But don't worry.,S01E26,87
I made it very clear.,S01E26,88
We are not keeping him.,S01E26,89
"Hey, you know something?",S01E26,90
He kind of reminds me of your Uncle stan.,S01E26,91
- What? - The wet nose and the bloodshot eyes.,S01E26,92
"Come on, he",S01E26,93
"Oh, now I see it.",S01E26,94
P.,S01E26,95
J.,S01E26,96
", I have a question.",S01E26,97
Was dad out of control when he was teaching you how to drive?,S01E26,98
"No no, he was very mellow.",S01E26,99
Then what is his problem?,S01E26,100
"Well, hair loss, kills bugs for a living",S01E26,101
There's so much to choose from.,S01E26,102
"Well, whatever it is, why did he have to take it out on me?",S01E26,103
I don't know.,S01E26,104
Maybe you're a bad driver.,S01E26,105
"No, I'm a good driver.",S01E26,106
I was the only kid in driver's ed.,S01E26,107
Who didn't barf during the splattered brains movie.,S01E26,108
Actually I have a question for you.,S01E26,109
I have a friend who is turning 16.,S01E26,110
And I have to buy her a birthday present.,S01E26,111
"Mm, well",S01E26,112
I know your friend wouldn't want a sock puppet.,S01E26,113
Okay.,S01E26,114
"Well, what would she want?",S01E26,115
"Well,",S01E26,116
"She'd probably like boots,",S01E26,117
"Like from that cool store at the mall,",S01E26,118
But not the black ones with the purple trim.,S01E26,119
She already has those.,S01E26,120
I'm just guessing.,S01E26,121
"Oh hi, Mrs.",S01E26,122
Dabney.,S01E26,123
I see you people have a dog now.,S01E26,124
"Oh, I'm doing fine, thanks.How are you?",S01E26,125
Let me explain something to you.,S01E26,126
Your dog makes my Cat nervous.,S01E26,127
"And when my Cat gets nervous, I get nervous.",S01E26,128
"And when I get nervous, Mr.",S01E26,129
Dabney gets nervous.,S01E26,130
Then what happens?,S01E26,131
Mr.,S01E26,132
Dabney goes to stay with his mother.,S01E26,133
So this dog thing is not entirely bad.,S01E26,134
"All right, we're done here.",S01E26,135
"Oh, Mrs. Dabney,before you go,",S01E26,136
"Um, I need some more practice hours.",S01E26,137
"Before I take my driver's test,",S01E26,138
"So if you ever need a chauffeur, I'm your girl.",S01E26,139
Let's go.,S01E26,140
Right now?,S01E26,141
I've got a bunch of errands to run.,S01E26,142
"And if you drive, I can play word jumble on my cell phone.",S01E26,143
"Actually I do that anyway,but this way it's legal.",S01E26,144
This store only has girls in it.,S01E26,145
Yeah.,S01E26,146
So what's Teddy's shoe size?,S01E26,147
I don't know.,S01E26,148
You don't know her shoe size?,S01E26,149
I don't know her middle name.,S01E26,150
"Well, dude, how are we supposed to buy her shoes?",S01E26,151
Wait a minute.,S01E26,152
"Teddy wore your sneakers by mistake last week, right?",S01E26,153
- Yes.,S01E26,154
- That means you're the same size.,S01E26,155
"Here, try these on.",S01E26,156
Oh no.,S01E26,157
I am not putting on girl boots.,S01E26,158
"Oh, come on.",S01E26,159
They'll look good with that girl shirt you're wearing.,S01E26,160
It's not a pony.,S01E26,161
It's a stallion.,S01E26,162
"Fine, I'll put them on for two seconds.",S01E26,163
Buying boots for my sister.,S01E26,164
Funny story she and my brother have the same size feet.,S01E26,165
"Good thing she didn't want underwear, right?",S01E26,166
"Okay, see you.",S01E26,167
"Okay, they fit.",S01E26,168
"Whoa, hold on, dude.You've gotta stand up,",S01E26,169
"Walk around, make sure they're comfortable.",S01E26,170
Come on.,S01E26,171
"Wow, those do wonders for your legs.",S01E26,172
"Okay, that's enough.",S01E26,173
They won't come off.,S01E26,174
What?Let me try.,S01E26,175
Why are your feet so fat?,S01E26,176
They're not fat.,S01E26,177
They're husky.,S01E26,178
What are we gonna do?,S01E26,179
"Well, there's only one thing to do.",S01E26,180
- Who are you calling? - No one.,S01E26,181
I'm taking a picture of you in girl boots.,S01E26,182
The light's not getting any greener.,S01E26,183
"I know, but the car in front of me hasn't moved yet.",S01E26,184
Here's a quick driving lesson.,S01E26,185
"Wake up, grandpa!",S01E26,186
"Sorry, that was her, not me.",S01E26,187
"Oh look, grandpa's telling us we're number one.",S01E26,188
"No, he's not.He's",S01E26,189
I know what he's doing.,S01E26,190
"So we should probably head home now, right?",S01E26,191
Just one more stop boulder.,S01E26,192
I want to see my sister.,S01E26,193
Boulder?That's in the mountains.,S01E26,194
"Oh, you got one of those flat-land-only driving permits?",S01E26,195
"No, it's just I have to be home by 7:00.",S01E26,196
"Oh, and we should probably stop for gas.",S01E26,197
In this car you can drive 100 miles on empty.,S01E26,198
I'll tell you when we need gas.,S01E26,199
Now we need gas.,S01E26,200
"Yeah, just one problem",S01E26,201
We're in the middle of nowhere.,S01E26,202
And it looks like rain.,S01E26,203
Agh!,S01E26,204
And there's a crazy woman outside my window.,S01E26,205
So actually we got three problems.,S01E26,206
Hello.,S01E26,207
Kinda hard to talk with the window open just a crack.,S01E26,208
Sorry.,S01E26,209
What are y'all doing over here?,S01E26,210
We're out of gas.,S01E26,211
"Well, this is your lucky day.",S01E26,212
There's gas and such down the road a spell.,S01E26,213
"Oh, how far is a spell?",S01E26,214
50 miles.,S01E26,215
"Of course, I got a gallon of gas right here.",S01E26,216
Great.How much is it?,S01E26,217
50 bucks.,S01E26,218
The mountain lady's got an angle.,S01E26,219
"I also got gum, mints, magazines.",S01E26,220
I could keep you up to date on all things Justin bieber.,S01E26,221
Oh.,S01E26,222
Charlie.,S01E26,223
"Charlie, hand mommy the tape.",S01E26,224
Fine.,S01E26,225
It'll just be a sweet 6 party.,S01E26,226
What are you drawing?,S01E26,227
Are you making a pretty picture?,S01E26,228
"What do you want, dog?",S01E26,229
Horsy.,S01E26,230
What are you doing?,S01E26,231
What are you doing?You cannot be here.,S01E26,232
You're kind of sweet.,S01E26,233
"Okay, just for a minute.",S01E26,234
"You're not such a bad dog, are you?",S01E26,235
"No, you're a good dog.",S01E26,236
I'm gonna call you sweetie-pie,S01E26,237
'cause you're a sweetie-pie.,S01E26,238
- Mommy.,S01E26,239
"- Charlie, not now.",S01E26,240
Yes.,S01E26,241
"Mom, we have got a big problem.",S01E26,242
"Oh, you sure do.",S01E26,243
Those boots do not go with those shorts.,S01E26,244
You are working my last nerve.,S01E26,245
She is a handful.,S01E26,246
Does any of this look familiar?,S01E26,247
Looks like the same road we drove down 10 minutes ago.,S01E26,248
So I'm just going in circles.,S01E26,249
And you didn't want to say anything?,S01E26,250
I thought my annoyed silence was speaking volumes.,S01E26,251
Okay.,S01E26,252
"Well, we're lost.",S01E26,253
And we need to look at a map.Do you have a map?,S01E26,254
On my cell phone.,S01E26,255
But I'd have to turn off my word jumble.,S01E26,256
Okay.,S01E26,257
What did you do now?,S01E26,258
I think we're in some kind of hole.,S01E26,259
"Well, then one of us is gonna have to get out and push",S01E26,260
The one of us who's 16.,S01E26,261
I'm not 16 yet.,S01E26,262
- Get out.,S01E26,263
- Okay.,S01E26,264
"Okay, hit it, but try to go",S01E26,265
Slow.,S01E26,266
"Okay, go again, but this time.",S01E26,267
Try to go a little bit slower.,S01E26,268
Oh.,S01E26,269
"Well, this would be a great time.",S01E26,270
For the mountain lady to come by with some skirts.,S01E26,271
"Hey, sweetie.",S01E26,272
- Hi.,S01E26,273
- Hi.,S01E26,274
I think you found my dog.,S01E26,275
"Um, we don't have a dog here.",S01E26,276
Really?,S01E26,277
I found this flyer with your address on it.,S01E26,278
Must be a misprint.,S01E26,279
No dog.,S01E26,280
Bye-bye.,S01E26,281
"Mom, mom, can I talk to you for a minute?",S01E26,282
"Hi, we'll be right with you.",S01E26,283
Okay.,S01E26,284
"Look, mom, we've got to do the right thing here.",S01E26,285
"If you want a dog,we can get you another one.",S01E26,286
I don't want another dog.,S01E26,287
I want my sweetie-pie.,S01E26,288
"Mom, he already has a family.",S01E26,289
Who loves him and misses him.,S01E26,290
He needs to go home.,S01E26,291
I know.,S01E26,292
"Goodbye, sweetie-pie.",S01E26,293
I will never forget you.,S01E26,294
Winston!,S01E26,295
Thank you.,S01E26,296
You're welcome.,S01E26,297
I'm very very proud of you.,S01E26,298

"Oh, you guys, Teddy's here.",S01E26,302
Everybody hide.,S01E26,303
Hide.,S01E26,304
Surprise!,S01E26,305
Aww.,S01E26,306
"Oh, okay.",S01E26,307
I know what you're thinking,S01E26,308
Teddy can wear anything.,S01E26,309
"Oh, um",S01E26,310
Why don't I go clean up.,S01E26,311
"And we'll try this again in 30 minutes, okay?",S01E26,312
"Oh, one more thingyou guys!",S01E26,313
"- Great cake, mom.",S01E26,314
- I got it at the store.,S01E26,315
I know.,S01E26,316
"That's why I said great cake, mom.",S01E26,317
"Dad, what are you doing out here?",S01E26,318
Just thinking.Are you enjoying your party?,S01E26,319
"Yeah, it's awesome.",S01E26,320
Thank you so much.,S01E26,321
"Dad, I have to tell you something.",S01E26,322
You spent the afternoon driving with Mrs.,S01E26,323
Dabney.,S01E26,324
You got all that from I have to tell you something?,S01E26,325
"No, actually I got all that.",S01E26,326
From when Mrs.,S01E26,327
Dabney returned your skirt.,S01E26,328
Now you know I told you I didn't want you driving.,S01E26,329
I know.,S01E26,330
I'm sorry.,S01E26,331
"All right, you know what?",S01E26,332
Let's just talk about this tomorrow.,S01E26,333
"- Dad, I'm a really good driver.",S01E26,334
- Teddy.,S01E26,335
"No, why are you treating me different than P.",S01E26,336
J.,S01E26,337
?.,S01E26,338
You didn't freak out on him when he was learning how to drive.,S01E26,339
Because teaching P.,S01E26,340
J.,S01E26,341
to drive was a completely different thing.,S01E26,342
- Why? - Because it was.,S01E26,343
- Why? - Because he's P.,S01E26,344
J.,S01E26,345
You're my little girl.,S01E26,346
Driving means leaving.,S01E26,347
"And once you get in that car,",S01E26,348
You go.,S01E26,349
Dad.,S01E26,350
"Look, I'm sorry, okay?",S01E26,351
You've got your party and stuff going on.,S01E26,352
I shouldn't be talking about this stuff.,S01E26,353
"Dad, it's sad to think.",S01E26,354
All your kids are gonna leave someday.,S01E26,355
"Well, actually to be perfectly honest,",S01E26,356
With P.,S01E26,357
J.,S01E26,358
I'm kind of worried he's never gonna leave.,S01E26,359
"Yeah, well,",S01E26,360
We'll hope for the best.,S01E26,361
"Dad, I want you to know that even though",S01E26,362
"I'm gonna get in that car and drive away someday,",S01E26,363
I'm also gonna drive back home.,S01E26,364
"Yeah, probably with a trunkful of laundry.",S01E26,365
Yeah.,S01E26,366
And now P.,S01E26,367
J.,S01E26,368
And Gabe.,S01E26,369
Have a special birthday surprise for you.,S01E26,370
But first let me introduce.,S01E26,371
Snoop Charlie char.,S01E26,372
"Teddy, this one's for you.",S01E26,373
- Ready?  - Yep.,S01E26,374
"Ready, set, go.",S01E26,375
we went to buy boots for a special sister,S01E26,376
but they got stuck and now I got a blister,S01E26,377
"we were out of money, we were out of time",S01E26,378
so we dressed up with Charlie and busted out a rhyme,S01E26,379
"you're 16 now, gonna move out soon",S01E26,380
in a few more years I'm gonna get your room,S01E26,381
"that's all we got, but we hope you know",S01E26,382
"that we're with you, Teddy, not matter where you go",S01E26,383
"- <I> Teddy, Teddy</I>  - Happy Birthday.",S01E26,384
"Well, Charlie, here we are,",S01E26,385
The Duncan sisters on my 16th birthday.,S01E26,386
"Can you say, happy birthday, Teddy?",S01E26,387
No? Okay.,S01E26,388
"Well, it's the thought that counts.",S01E26,389
"Anyway, the big news is I got my driver's license,",S01E26,390
Which means I now have total freedom to go wherever I want.,S01E26,391
"Teddy, I need you to pick up some things at the store.",S01E26,392
"And while you're at it,the car needs gas.",S01E26,393
And pick up gabe just cause I don't wanna.,S01E26,394
Total freedom.,S01E26,395
"Can you wish me good luck, Charlie?",S01E26,396
It's the thought that counts.,S01E26,397
Are we there yet?,S01E26,398
Did you see a grand canyon?,S01E26,399
I need to go to the bathroom.,S01E26,400
I told you to go before we left.,S01E26,401
- I didn't have to go then.  - Are we there now?,S01E26,402
"License and registration, ma'am.",S01E26,403
"Gabe, it's me Teddy.",S01E26,404
I'm sorry.,S01E26,405
"License and registration, Teddy.",S01E26,406
You got lucky.,S01E26,407
Today's all burnt toast,S01E26,408
"Running late, and dad jokes",S01E26,409
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S01E26,410
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S01E26,411
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S01E26,412
There it is up on the roof,S01E26,413
"I've been there, I've survived",S01E26,414
So just take my advice,S01E26,415
"Hang in there, baby, ",S01E26,416
Things are crazy,S01E26,417
But I know your future is bright,S01E26,418
"Hang in there, baby",S01E26,419
There is no maybe,S01E26,420
Everything turns out all right,S01E26,421
Sure life is up and down,S01E26,422
"But trust me, it comes back around",S01E26,423
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S01E26,424
"Hang in there, baby.",S01E26,425
"Well, this is awful.",S02E01,0
I can't believe we're spending Charlie's birthday in jail.,S02E01,1
"Well, as long as we're all in here together,",S02E01,2
let's go over some ground rules.,S02E01,3
This is just a chair.,S02E01,4
"-Well, what if I -Uh-uh.",S02E01,5
-What if -Hold it.,S02E01,6
"Guys, it could be worse.",S02E01,7
Mom and dad could know we're here.,S02E01,8
-Kids? -Uh-oh.,S02E01,9
"Hi, mom.",S02E01,10
"Hi, dad.",S02E01,11
-Hi.,S02E01,12
-Hey.,S02E01,13
Nice family you got here.,S02E01,14
I'm guessing the dog is in the pound?,S02E01,15
"We don't have a dog, officer snootee.",S02E01,16
It's pronounced snoo-tay.,S02E01,17
"-Get in there, you two.",S02E01,18
-Here.,S02E01,19
What are you guys doing here?,S02E01,20
What are you guys doing here?,S02E01,21
"Okay, before we get to that,",S02E01,22
let's go over the ground rules again.,S02E01,23
"Dad, I want you to pay extra close attention.",S02E01,24
Today's all burnt toast ,S02E01,25
"Running late, and dad jokes",S02E01,26
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S02E01,27
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S02E01,28
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S02E01,29
There it is up on the roof,S02E01,30
"I've been there, I've survived",S02E01,31
So just take my advice,S02E01,32
"Hang in there, baby",S02E01,33
Things are crazy,S02E01,34
But I know your future's bright,S02E01,35
"Hang in there, baby",S02E01,36
There's no maybe,S02E01,37
Everything turns out all right,S02E01,38
Your life is up and down,S02E01,39
But trust me it comes back around,S02E01,40
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S02E01,41
"Hang in there, baby.",S02E01,42
So my kids are in jail.,S02E01,43
Anybody wanna tell me why?,S02E01,44
"Nope, we're good.",S02E01,45
"Well, what about you? Why are you guys in jail?",S02E01,46
"Hey, we asked you first.",S02E01,47
Start talking.,S02E01,48
"All right well, as the oldest",S02E01,49
I guess I owe you guys an explanation.,S02E01,50
It's all Teddy's fault.,S02E01,51
-What? It is not! -Oh really?,S02E01,52
We wouldn't be here,S02E01,53
if you hadn't promised Charlie,S02E01,54
a birthday present you couldn't deliver.,S02E01,55
"Well, Charlie, here you are,",S02E01,56
"watching your favorite tv show, the gurgles.",S02E01,57
That's the sound we make,S02E01,58
If we march in circles,S02E01,59
and watch you play along,S02E01,60
"Just sit down, annoy your mom",S02E01,61
"and sing the gurgle song, gurgles!",S02E01,62
"It's kind of annoying,",S02E01,63
but I guess it's entertaining to your little brain.,S02E01,64
"Oh, the gurgles! What did I miss?",S02E01,65
-I love gurgles. -Shh!,S02E01,66
So if we're having a contest for who gives Charlie,S02E01,67
"the best birthday present ever,",S02E01,68
I'll accept my prize now.,S02E01,69
"Okay well, I gave her the gift of life,",S02E01,70
so let's see what you got.,S02E01,71
I'm getting her tickets to the gurgles concert.,S02E01,72
-Oh! -Yeah.,S02E01,73
"I want her to have a great second birthday,",S02E01,74
unlike mine when I didn't get the gift I wanted.,S02E01,75
"Here we go, still whining about a hello doggy.",S02E01,76
"Howdy puppy,",S02E01,77
the rootinest tootinest little chihuahua in the West.,S02E01,78
I wanted him more than anything in the world,S02E01,79
and I,S02E01,80
"Oh, too soon.",S02E01,81
"Hey, how are you coming with the entertainment?",S02E01,82
Entertainment. Entertainment?,S02E01,83
For Charlie's birthday party.,S02E01,84
-What did you decide on? -Ah.,S02E01,85
Still thinking.,S02E01,86
Noodling.,S02E01,87
A lot of things going on in the old hopper.,S02E01,88
"The hopper's empty, isn't it, Bob?",S02E01,89
I I don't even know where it is anymore.,S02E01,90
"Honey, Charlie's party is in three days.",S02E01,91
"Oh, honey, come on, relax.",S02E01,92
I'll think of something.,S02E01,93
"Okay, we'll do a clown,",S02E01,94
a bouncy house whatever.,S02E01,95
"Bob, honey, you have to reserve those things.",S02E01,96
We have to decide on something good,S02E01,97
or it's gonna be hello doggy all over again.,S02E01,98
Howdy puppy!,S02E01,99
"-Hey, can I check my email? -No no no no no.",S02E01,100
I'm about to buy gurgles concert tickets online.,S02E01,101
They go on sale in eight seconds,S02E01,102
and I'm gonna be the first one to get them.,S02E01,103
"Okay, here we go.",S02E01,104
"Three, two, one.",S02E01,105
What? Sold out?!,S02E01,106
"Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.",S02E01,107
Hang on.,S02E01,108
Let me get in there.,S02E01,109
Let's see.,S02E01,110
-What are you doing? -Checking my email.,S02E01,111
What? Give me that.,S02E01,112
How am I gonna get the tickets now?,S02E01,113
"Well, the other day I was listening",S02E01,114
"to that radio station for kids, K.",S02E01,115
I.,S02E01,116
D.,S02E01,117
Z.,S02E01,118
"Hey, kidz.",S02E01,119
I just got that.,S02E01,120
Why are you listening to the kidz radio station?,S02E01,121
Because they told me not to change the channel.,S02E01,122
"Anyway, they're having a contest.",S02E01,123
Whoever makes the best video wins tickets to the gurgles concert.,S02E01,124
We could make a great video.,S02E01,125
All we need is one good idea.,S02E01,126
"Oh okay, how about this?",S02E01,127
So we make a video of me putting on,S02E01,128
200 pairs of underpants.,S02E01,129
And then I turn around and on my butt it says.,S02E01,130
I heart the gurgles.,S02E01,131
"Yeah, that's not it.",S02E01,132
I've I've got an idea.,S02E01,133
I've written some really great kid songs.,S02E01,134
We could turn one of those into a video.,S02E01,135
One good idea.,S02E01,136
Just one good idea.,S02E01,137
I have got a song about talking toes,S02E01,138
that will knock your socks off.,S02E01,139
You get it? Cause it okay.,S02E01,140
"Okay, we're still going through all the bad ideas.",S02E01,141
"But we need a good one,",S02E01,142
and Charlie should be the star of it.,S02E01,143
"Well, I've always wanted to shoot her out of a cannon.",S02E01,144
"All right, still emptying out all those bad ideas, okay.",S02E01,145
No cannons? No underpants?,S02E01,146
You're really tying my hands here.,S02E01,147
"Hey hey, honey! Honey!",S02E01,148
"Hey, come on.",S02E01,149
Come in here.,S02E01,150
Come on.,S02E01,151
-I've got something I wanna show you. -What is it?,S02E01,152
I wanna show you the entertainment I got for Charlie's party.,S02E01,153
Voila.,S02E01,154
A little cart.,S02E01,155
This is why I'm missing judge ira?,S02E01,156
"Oh my, I seemed to have put the cart before the",S02E01,157
Horse!,S02E01,158
Are you sure it's a horse?,S02E01,159
I've seen bigger dogs.,S02E01,160
"Actually, I've seen bigger cats.",S02E01,161
"Honey, it's a miniature horse.",S02E01,162
"Well, he is kind of cute.",S02E01,163
-Where did you find him? -At the stables.,S02E01,164
"You know, I was gonna get a pony,",S02E01,165
and then I met this guy in the parking lot,S02E01,166
"who said, Have I got a deal for you.",S02E01,167
"And well, after I said no thank you to the speakers,",S02E01,168
he brought out shamrock here.,S02E01,169
"Aw, he's adorable.",S02E01,170
Why is his tail going up?,S02E01,171
Oh.,S02E01,172
That was great.,S02E01,173
"Hey, mom, we finished the video.",S02E01,174
"-You wanna see it? -Oh, can't wait.",S02E01,175
"Yeah, we are so gonna win those tickets.",S02E01,176
Gurgles!,S02E01,177
Good evening.,S02E01,178
"I'm here with the world's biggest gurgles fan,",S02E01,179
miss Charlotte Duncan.,S02E01,180
"Oh no, please call me Charlie.",S02E01,181
We're all friends here.,S02E01,182
"So, Charlie, tell me how you first",S02E01,183
became acquainted with the gurgles.,S02E01,184
"Well, I was 17 no, 18 months",S02E01,185
and I was doing a little bit of channel surfing.,S02E01,186
"Boring, blah.",S02E01,187
"Been there, seen that. Then ba-bam!",S02E01,188
The most wonderful collection of shapes and colors.,S02E01,189
-I had ever seen.,S02E01,190
-The gurgles.,S02E01,191
The gurgles indeed.,S02E01,192
And seeing them in concert would make me feel,S02E01,193
"Well, why don't I just show you?",S02E01,194
"Lights, please.",S02E01,195
"-Wow, look at this.",S02E01,196
-Cool.,S02E01,197
Wow!,S02E01,198
Forgive me.,S02E01,199
I got a bit carried away.,S02E01,200
"Now if we're done here,",S02E01,201
I was promised a juice box.,S02E01,202
"You guys, that was amazing!",S02E01,203
"Oh, mom, you made a brilliant Charlie.",S02E01,204
"Oh, didn't I?",S02E01,205
"Good show, good show.",S02E01,206
Again.,S02E01,207
-Yes? -Yeah.,S02E01,208
"Hey, honey, you seen the garage door opener?",S02E01,209
Never mind.,S02E01,210
What are you doing?,S02E01,211
There's a mini-horse in our garage.,S02E01,212
Did you really think I wouldn't take advantage of that?,S02E01,213
Where did you go?,S02E01,214
Just down the street to Austin's house.,S02E01,215
He's been bragging about his new dog.,S02E01,216
This shut him right up.,S02E01,217
"All right, come on. Get out of there, would you?",S02E01,218
Okay.,S02E01,219
"Oh, here.",S02E01,220
There you go.,S02E01,221
-What is this? -Tickets.,S02E01,222
Did you know you can't text while riding a mini-horse?,S02E01,223
"- Uh, Gabe - Yep?",S02E01,224
- You forgetting something? - Oh right.,S02E01,225
"Hey, it's 3:00.",S02E01,226

I'm on it,S02E01,228
"Hey, P.",S02E01,229
J.,S02E01,230
I didn't know you were working today.,S02E01,231
I'm not.,S02E01,232
This is my only clean shirt.,S02E01,233
Then why are you wearing the hat?,S02E01,234
I don't wanna look stupid.,S02E01,235
"Oh, it's up.",S02E01,236
They've posted the winning video.,S02E01,237
"Oh, I can't look.",S02E01,238
"Okay, tell me we won.",S02E01,239
Tell me we won.,S02E01,240
Why aren't you telling me we won?,S02E01,241
- Because we lost.,S02E01,242
- What? I don't believe it.,S02E01,243
What video could possibly be better than ours?,S02E01,244
How much do I love the gurgles?,S02E01,245
Now at this point,S02E01,246
a jerk might say I told you so.,S02E01,247
I told you so!,S02E01,248
So now what are we gonna do?,S02E01,249
Go downtown to the piedmont hotel,S02E01,250
where the gurgles are staying and beg them for tickets?,S02E01,251
How do you know where they're staying?,S02E01,252
It was on the all things gurgles website.,S02E01,253
Am I the only one who reads that?,S02E01,254
"Yes yes, because you're their only fan",S02E01,255
that can actually read.,S02E01,256
So you're just gonna knock on their door,S02E01,257
and they're gonna let you in?,S02E01,258
They will if we're delivering,S02E01,259
a delicious bucket of chicken.,S02E01,260

You expect people to follow it.,S02E01,267
"Gabe, she's  two.",S02E01,268
She can't hold it.,S02E01,269
Can we turn around now,S02E01,270
"Actually, give me a second.",S02E01,271
Unbelievable.,S02E01,272
"All right, would you please just finish the story?",S02E01,273

We want to ask about concert tickets.,S02E01,286
- And we brought chicken. - Huh?,S02E01,287
"Whoa whoa whoa, wait a minute.",S02E01,288
The other gurgles put you up to this?,S02E01,289
Are they testing me to see if I'll stay on my diet?,S02E01,290
Testing you?,S02E01,291

Triangle writes all our songs,S02E01,306

"and watch tv, okay?",S02E01,317
"Aw, nuts.",S02E01,318
"Okay, I'll be back in a little while.",S02E01,319

when he sticks his tiny head out the window.,S02E01,322
"Oh! Bob, get out here! The horse is gone.",S02E01,323
We've been rustled? Dag nabbit!,S02E01,324

"And besides, what's the worst that could happen?",S02E01,328
It's not like they're gonna throw us in jail.,S02E01,329
"Okay, stop laughing.",S02E01,330

My husband rented it for our daughter's birthday party.,S02E01,376
"Just show me the rental agreement,",S02E01,377
we can clear this right up.,S02E01,378
I haven't got a rental agreement.,S02E01,379
I got a sweaty handshake,S02E01,380

How did you get here?,S02E01,396
"Oh, cute story, actually.",S02E01,397
So it was after the concert.,S02E01,398
I can't believe I went to Yale.,S02E01,399
Now I'm a gurgle.,S02E01,400
I've got talkin' toes,S02E01,401
The big one likes to say hello,S02E01,402
The other four are not so bold,S02E01,403
They curl up when it gets too cold.,S02E01,404
"That's great, kid.",S02E01,405
"Oh, you like that one? I've got plenty of others",S02E01,406

That's not a good idea for a song.,S02E01,409
Oh.,S02E01,410
"See you later, I'm off to jail",S02E01,411
Could you do me a favor and post my bail?,S02E01,412
Here's a gurglewho went to Yale ,S02E01,413
so I was busted for harassing a gurgle,S02E01,414
and stripped of my membership from the fan club.,S02E01,415
"Okay, Duncans, you're free to go.",S02E01,416
You've been bailed out.,S02E01,417
- Bailed out? - By who?,S02E01,418
Gurgle circle.,S02E01,419
"Yeah yeah, biggest moment of your life.",S02E01,420
But why did you bail us out?,S02E01,421
"Well, I played pick a scab",S02E01,422
for the other gurgles and they loved it.,S02E01,423
"- I sold a song? - No, i sold a song.",S02E01,424
You got bailed out.,S02E01,425
"Welcome to showbiz, kid.",S02E01,426
"You know, I'm gonna miss this place.",S02E01,427
"Oh, don't worry, you'll be back.",S02E01,428
"Well, Charlie, your second birthday",S02E01,429
turned out to be pretty memorable,S02E01,430
"More memorable than my second birthday, that's for sure.",S02E01,431
Still too soon.,S02E01,432
"Anyways, you never did get to see the gurgles in concert,",S02E01,433
but that's okay because you have a new favorite show.,S02E01,434
"Ooh, the buttercups!",S02E01,435
"But if you ever wanna see the buttercups in concert,",S02E01,436
"good luck, Charlie.",S02E01,437
Shh! This is a new one.,S02E01,438
"Hey, dad, do you mind if I take Charlie out for a spin?",S02E01,439
"Ooh, sorry, Gabe.",S02E01,440
We don't have the horse anymore.,S02E01,441
But we do have the cart.,S02E01,442
Faster!,S02E01,443
"Okay, say Cheese.",S02E01,444
Giddy up.,S02E01,445

What have you got to say about that?,S02E02,13
"I love you, daddy?",S02E02,14
"Come on, Teddy, this is so irresponsible.",S02E02,15
I expect more from you.,S02E02,16
Hold on.,S02E02,17
I'm getting a text.,S02E02,18
"No, you're not,",S02E02,19
'cause I'm taking your phone away.,S02E02,20
"What? No, you can't do that.",S02E02,21
Taking away my phone would be like taking away your pizza.,S02E02,22
You're fighting for your phone.,S02E02,23
By calling me fat?,S02E02,24
"Well, I'm just really mad.",S02E02,25
"I love you, daddy.",S02E02,26
I'll tell you what You'll get your phone back.,S02E02,27

What?,S02E02,32
"Well, I was pulling into the garage.",S02E02,33
And I kind of scraped the bug truck.,S02E02,34
Instead of Bob's bugs be gone,S02E02,35

P.,S02E02,37
J.,S02E02,38

"Yeah, dad?",S02E02,40
Try and be more careful.,S02E02,41
That's it? He gets try and be more careful,S02E02,42
and I get my phone taken away? Unbelievable!,S02E02,43
"Whoa. She's a handful, eh, Rob?",S02E02,44
Today's all burnt toast ,S02E02,45
"Running late, and dad jokes",S02E02,46
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S02E02,47
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S02E02,48
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S02E02,49
There it is up on the roof,S02E02,50
"I've been there, I've survived",S02E02,51
So just take my advice,S02E02,52

"Hey, guys, see you later.",S02E02,63
Are you taking Charlie somewhere?,S02E02,64
"Yes, to the mall.",S02E02,65
We're going to go shopping.,S02E02,66
Shopping for what?,S02E02,67
Girls.,S02E02,68
They just can't resist our adorable little sister.,S02E02,69
I can't believe you'd use Charlie as girl bait.,S02E02,70
"Oh, let him do it.",S02E02,71
"Without charm or personality,",S02E02,72
it's his only play.,S02E02,73
Thank you.,S02E02,74
"All right, just have Charlie back by 3:00.",S02E02,75
I'm taking her to a birthday party at Otto's grotto.,S02E02,76
"Oh, no problem.",S02E02,77
Shouldn't take long.,S02E02,78
"Hey, Charlie, say that thing I taught you.",S02E02,79
I wuv P.,S02E02,80

"I know, but wuv gets me way more girls.",S02E02,83
Hey honey.,S02E02,84
-Hey. -What's wrong?,S02E02,85
Nobody to play video tennis with.,S02E02,86
All my friends are doing homework.,S02E02,87
Or spending time with their families,S02E02,88
Losers.,S02E02,89
I'll play with you.,S02E02,90
I think I'll go read a book.,S02E02,91
You'd rather read a book.,S02E02,92
Than play video games with your mom?,S02E02,93
"Yeah, you're right.",S02E02,94
I'm gonna go take a nap.,S02E02,95
"Gabe, I've played video games before.",S02E02,96
I know what I'm doing.,S02E02,97
"Mom, that's the tv remote.",S02E02,98
Which I'm moving out of the way.,S02E02,99
So that I can pick up a controller.,S02E02,100
"All right, serve it up, Sonny boy.",S02E02,101
Fine.,S02E02,102
This won't be any fun.,S02E02,103
"Okay, are you ready?",S02E02,104
Go for it.,S02E02,105
"Wow, this might be more fun than I thought.",S02E02,106
Where's Charlie? Where'd Charlie go?,S02E02,107
"Oh, there she is.",S02E02,108
There she is.,S02E02,109
Yeah yeah yeah.,S02E02,110
"Oh, wow.",S02E02,111
Maybe we should put that back.,S02E02,112
Mine.,S02E02,113
"Well, they probably won't miss one ball.",S02E02,114
I count every ball every night!,S02E02,115
Can you zip me up?,S02E02,116
No.,S02E02,117
"No, thank you.",S02E02,118
The girl that usually plays the mermaid,S02E02,119
she quit on me.,S02E02,120
She's now the Pickle at hamburger Hank's.,S02E02,121
"Well, you knew her when.",S02E02,122
That Hank is killing me.,S02E02,123
With his fancy minimum wage.,S02E02,124
"I can't believe I'm about to say this,",S02E02,125
but I could use a job.,S02E02,126
"Okay, slow it down.",S02E02,127
It takes three things to work at Otto's grotto.,S02E02,128
-One you gotta be 16.,S02E02,129
-I am.,S02E02,130
"Two you gotta be good with kids,",S02E02,131
which basically means willing to clean up their puke.,S02E02,132
"I am, she said less excitedly.",S02E02,133
"And most important,",S02E02,134
you gotta speak the language of the sea.,S02E02,135
The what?,S02E02,136
"Like don't be crabby, kids.",S02E02,137
We're gonna have a whale of a time.,S02E02,138
Stuff like that.,S02E02,139
It's our hook.,S02E02,140
"Whoa, I just did it again!",S02E02,141
"Yeah, well, don't worry.",S02E02,142
I won't clam up on you.,S02E02,143
"Well, you'll work on it.",S02E02,144
-When can you start? -The sooner the baiter.,S02E02,145
The first puke you clean up may be mine.,S02E02,146
"Okay, Gabe, what do you think?",S02E02,147
Buttoned? Unbuttoned?,S02E02,148
Unbuttoned give those four chest hairs a chance to breathe.,S02E02,149
So you got a girl coming over?,S02E02,150
"Yep, her name is Kayla.",S02E02,151
I met her at the mall.,S02E02,152
Charlie got you a girl?,S02E02,153
"Yeah, worked like a charm",S02E02,154
"Well, except Charlie got a little confused.",S02E02,155
Instead of saying I wuv P.,S02E02,156
J.,S02E02,157
"She said, I wuv poopy.",S02E02,158
I think Charlie knew what she was saying.,S02E02,159
"Yeah, but I totally saved it.",S02E02,160
I told Kayla my nickname was poopy.,S02E02,161
Kayla and poopy,S02E02,162
"Many years of happiness, sir.",S02E02,163
"Come on, boys, work your magic.",S02E02,164
-Hi Kayla.,S02E02,165
-Hi.,S02E02,166
-This is my brother Gabe. -Ooh ooh ooh!,S02E02,167
"Charlie, there's my little sweetie.",S02E02,168
Hi.,S02E02,169
Come here.,S02E02,170
"Have fun, poopy.",S02E02,171
So do you want to hang out downstairs?,S02E02,172
I have an even better idea.,S02E02,173
"Ashes ashes, we all fall down.",S02E02,174
"Oh my goodne, you're so good.",S02E02,175
"Okay, who wants to play peek-a-boo?",S02E02,176
"-Who wants to play peek-a-boo? -Actually,",S02E02,177
Charlie has to take her nap right now.,S02E02,178
Oh.,S02E02,179
"Well, I guess I'll be going.",S02E02,180
Really?,S02E02,181
I thought we could have some Kayla and poopy time.,S02E02,182
"Yeah, well, maybe next time.",S02E02,183
But this was a really good playdate.,S02E02,184
"I guess, yeah.",S02E02,185
"-Bye, Charlie.",S02E02,186
-Goodbye-bye.,S02E02,187
Who's gonna get a big kiss? I'm going in.,S02E02,188
-Ha! -Mom.,S02E02,189
-Ha! -Dad!,S02E02,190
-Ha! -Mom.,S02E02,191
-Ha! -Dad!,S02E02,192
Ha!,S02E02,193
Can you please make it stop?,S02E02,194
What are you doing?,S02E02,195
Practicing video tennis.,S02E02,196
Gabe crushed me today.,S02E02,197
"You know, it's about 11:00.",S02E02,198
"Yeah, well, mama don't like to lose.",S02E02,199
Didn't we used to have a lamp here?,S02E02,200
I don't think so.,S02E02,201
"Dad, get her out of here.",S02E02,202
I have work tomorrow.,S02E02,203
You got a job?,S02E02,204
"Yeah, I am the puke-cleaning mermaid",S02E02,205
at Otto's grotto.,S02E02,206
But of course if you give me my phone back I can still quit.,S02E02,207
Be sure and wear gloves.,S02E02,208
Ha! Ha!,S02E02,209
"All right, let's go.",S02E02,210
"Come on, give me the controller.",S02E02,211
Not now.,S02E02,212
Mama's in the zone.,S02E02,213
"Yeah, mama doesn't know where the zone is.",S02E02,214
Hey.,S02E02,215
Oh good.,S02E02,216
You're right on time.,S02E02,217
"Yeah, well, it's my first day.",S02E02,218
I didn't want to leave you floundering.,S02E02,219
So where's my mermaid suit?,S02E02,220
"No, that was for a girls' party.",S02E02,221
Today you are working a boys' party.,S02E02,222
They don't like mermaids.,S02E02,223
"All right, so what do they like?",S02E02,224
"Hey hey, stop that.",S02E02,225
Ollie octopus is not a pinata.,S02E02,226
I know.,S02E02,227
Pinatas are fun.,S02E02,228
"Okay, guppies, grab your shoes",S02E02,229
Or any shoes.,S02E02,230
And join your parents outside.,S02E02,231
"Hey, lock up for me, will you?",S02E02,232
"Wait, what?",S02E02,233
And don't forget to count the balls.,S02E02,234
"All right, you heard the man.",S02E02,235
Everybody out.,S02E02,236
Na na!,S02E02,237
Na na!,S02E02,238
Just wait till I get my tentacles on you.,S02E02,239
"Hey, I'm stuck.",S02E02,240
Could you help me?,S02E02,241
No.,S02E02,242
Hello?,S02E02,243
Anybody?,S02E02,244
Kelp.,S02E02,245
"Uh! I'm getting better, aren't I?",S02E02,246
"Yeah, mom.",S02E02,247
That time you only lost 6-1.,S02E02,248
"Hey hey, excuse me, what are you doing?",S02E02,249
I have to study for my history test tomorrow.,S02E02,250
Put that book down and pick up the controller.,S02E02,251
"Dad, mom won't let me do my homework.",S02E02,252
You can do it when you finish playing.,S02E02,253
I am so confused.,S02E02,254
Fine. You know what?,S02E02,255
Finish your stupid homework.,S02E02,256
Call me when you get your priorities straight.,S02E02,257
"Dad, dad, she's out of control.",S02E02,258
You have to talk to her.,S02E02,259
"Why? Because when I tell her to do things, she does them?",S02E02,260
Haven't you been paying attention.,S02E02,261
To the way things work around here?,S02E02,262
"Well, what am I supposed to do?",S02E02,263
"Well, it's easy.",S02E02,264
"Next time you play her, you let her win.",S02E02,265
Let her win?,S02E02,266
Have you ever seen her play?,S02E02,267
I'm not even sure that's possible.,S02E02,268
I'm sure you'll figure it out.,S02E02,269
"All right, come on, get over there and study for your test.",S02E02,270
"Oh, I made that test up just to get rid of her.",S02E02,271
"-You want to play? -Yeah, sure.",S02E02,272
Hey Kayla. Are we going on a picnic?,S02E02,273
"Yes, we are.",S02E02,274
"I have animal crackers, juice boxes.",S02E02,275
And pb&j sandwiches cut into the shapes of stars.,S02E02,276
"Wow, all my favorites.",S02E02,277
"No, I brought them for Charlie, silly.",S02E02,278
"Well, Charlie's not here.",S02E02,279
Mom took her to the playground.,S02E02,280
Oh.,S02E02,281
"Well, let's go meet them there.",S02E02,282
You know what? I'm starting to think.,S02E02,283
That you'd rather spend time with Charlie than with me.,S02E02,284
What?,S02E02,285
That's crazy.,S02E02,286
Are you really jealous of a two-year-old?,S02E02,287
How can a hot guy like you.,S02E02,288
Be so insecure?,S02E02,289
"-Okay, I'm feeling a little better.",S02E02,290
-Yeah.,S02E02,291
The hot guy part really helped.,S02E02,292
Hello? Teddy!,S02E02,293
In here.,S02E02,294
What?,S02E02,295
So how was your first day?,S02E02,296
Get me out of here.,S02E02,297
I'm stuck.,S02E02,298
"Okay, all right.",S02E02,299
Don't worry.,S02E02,300
I'm coming in after you.,S02E02,301
"Oh, man, wow.",S02E02,302
"You know, if I had unlimited texting,",S02E02,303
this wouldn't have happened.,S02E02,304
"Okay, I'm gonna try and push you out, okay?",S02E02,305
Now try pulling.,S02E02,306
"Wow, you know what?",S02E02,307
"You're really wedged in there, Teddy.",S02E02,308
"All right, okay, I'm gonna I'm gonna go for help.",S02E02,309
Uh-oh.,S02E02,310
-Huh! -Ugh!,S02E02,311
"Well, another good shot, mom.",S02E02,312
Is that a bell I hear? Cause you just got schooled.,S02E02,313
Are you trash-talking me?,S02E02,314
What's the matter? Can't take it?,S02E02,315
Gonna run home crying to your mommy?,S02E02,316
You are my mommy.,S02E02,317
And you are my loser!,S02E02,318
That's it.,S02E02,319
"That's it, mom.",S02E02,320
Now I'm playing for real.,S02E02,321
-Let's do this.,S02E02,322
"-Okay, let's to this.",S02E02,323
Where did you learn how to do that?,S02E02,324
I found some cheats on the Internet.,S02E02,325
"Didn't think I knew about cheats, did ya?",S02E02,326
I didn't think you knew about the Internet.,S02E02,327
"Dad, why are you banging your butt against the tube?",S02E02,328
I'm trying to butt-dial the house.,S02E02,329
"It's number one on the speed-dial,",S02E02,330
so it should be easy.,S02E02,331
Ralph's pizza.,S02E02,332
"You want your usual, bobby?",S02E02,333
The house is on speed-dial two.,S02E02,334
"-Mom, phone.",S02E02,335
-You get it.,S02E02,336
"No, you get it.",S02E02,337
Hi-yo.,S02E02,338
"Charlie, Charlie, it's daddy, honey.",S02E02,339
"Listen, go tell your mother we're stuck in a tube.",S02E02,340
At that kids' place at the mall. What's the name of this place?,S02E02,341
"Dad, she's two.",S02E02,342
Good point.,S02E02,343
"Charlie, go get your mommy.",S02E02,344
Bye-bye.,S02E02,345
"Good going, dad.",S02E02,346
I'm not the one who got stuck in a tube.,S02E02,347
"Well, I'm not the first one anyway.",S02E02,348
"No, this is all your fault. If it wasn't for you,",S02E02,349
I wouldn't even need this stupid job.,S02E02,350
"Hey, you're the one who went over her texting minutes.",S02E02,351
Actions do have consequences.,S02E02,352
Not for P.,S02E02,353
J.,S02E02,354
It's like you hold me to a totally different standard.,S02E02,355
"Yeah, I treat you differently.",S02E02,356
But why?,S02E02,357
"Look, Teddy, this isn't about P.",S02E02,358
J.,S02E02,359
This is about you.,S02E02,360
I have high expectations.,S02E02,361
That's why I'm tough on you.,S02E02,362
"Dad, that's not fair.",S02E02,363
"Oh, honey, look,",S02E02,364
I hold you to a high standard.,S02E02,365
Because you are capable of great things.,S02E02,366
I am?,S02E02,367
"Well, in the future.",S02E02,368
Today you were defeated by an octopus costume.,S02E02,369
And a plastic tube.,S02E02,370
"Thanks, daddy.",S02E02,371
What was that?,S02E02,372
That sounded like,S02E02,373
Whoa!,S02E02,374
Ow!,S02E02,375
How long have you two been down here?,S02E02,376
Quiet!,S02E02,377
I tried calling the house.,S02E02,378
"In case anyone is interested, it was an emergency.",S02E02,379
Take that!,S02E02,380
-No no no no no! -What happened?,S02E02,381
"Oh, this? This is for your own good.",S02E02,382
"Well, we've been playing for six hours.",S02E02,383
I was about to win.,S02E02,384
I was about to win.,S02E02,385
"Well, now we'll never know,",S02E02,386
because I'm taking this,S02E02,387
and putting it on a high shelf.,S02E02,388
"I don't know, man.",S02E02,389
Maybe he's right.,S02E02,390
Maybe we did get a little crazy.,S02E02,391
Yeah. You know my friend Jake?,S02E02,392
He has the same game at his house.,S02E02,393
"Nah, it's really late.",S02E02,394
I know where they hide the spare key.,S02E02,395
Meet you in the car.,S02E02,396
"Hey, Kayla, it's P.",S02E02,397
J.,S02E02,398
"It's, like, my fifth message. Where are you?",S02E02,399
-She's in the kitchen. -What?,S02E02,400
What is going on in here?,S02E02,401
I can explain.,S02E02,402
"-Poopy, I -Don't you poopy me.",S02E02,403
"You know, it's not what it looks like.",S02E02,404
Really? Because it looks like.,S02E02,405
You're having a playdate behind my back.,S02E02,406
"I'm sorry, but it's Charlie is so cute.",S02E02,407
And then one thing led to another,S02E02,408
"No, I think it would be best for everyone if you left.",S02E02,409
"Charlie, don't let him do this.",S02E02,410
Say something.,S02E02,411
Bye-bye.,S02E02,412
How could you?,S02E02,413
I sorry.,S02E02,414
"Oh, I can't stay mad at you.",S02E02,415
I wuv P.,S02E02,416
J.,S02E02,417
Save it for the mall.,S02E02,418
We're going back tomorrow.,S02E02,419
"Hey, Charlie,",S02E02,420
it's your dad here.,S02E02,421
I'm filling in for Teddy.,S02E02,422
Because she's getting ready for her new job.,S02E02,423
"She's working over at hamburger Hank's now,",S02E02,424
so no more silly octopus costumes for her.,S02E02,425
"Dad, I'm ready. Can we go?",S02E02,426
You want to say something to your little sister?,S02E02,427
No no.,S02E02,428
Don't ever go over your texting limit.,S02E02,429
Unless you want to end up like me,S02E02,430
A dancing hot dog.,S02E02,431
"Good luck, Charlie.",S02E02,432
What she said.,S02E02,433
What are you doing here?,S02E02,434
I'm missing a few things.,S02E02,435
The ball pit was a little light.,S02E02,436
You really count?,S02E02,437
"Yes, I really count.",S02E02,438
You don't become a #4 kids' entertainment purveyor.,S02E02,439
In the Denver Metro area without counting!,S02E02,440
"All right, well, we don't have any balls.",S02E02,441
Oh really?,S02E02,442
"'Cause, see, I noticed that your little sister.",S02E02,443
Had some sticky fingers.,S02E02,444
Fine.,S02E02,445
I'll ask.,S02E02,446
"Charlie,",S02E02,447
do you know anything about some missing balls?,S02E02,448
"Is that it, Charlie?",S02E02,449
"Come on, Charlie.",S02E03,0
Go tinkle-winkle.,S02E03,1
Make the poo-poo for the mama.,S02E03,2
No no?,S02E03,3
"All right, I'll tell you what",S02E03,4
"Five bucks for a number one, 10 bucks for a number two.",S02E03,5
All right?,S02E03,6
"Uh uh uh, excuse me, what are you doing?",S02E03,7
Playing a video game.,S02E03,8
That's how kids.,S02E03,9
From our generation entertain themselves.,S02E03,10
Charlie is watching her favorite show.,S02E03,11
It's the only way we can get her to sit on the potty.,S02E03,12
Charlie has to watch the gurgles,S02E03,13
In order to do her business?,S02E03,14
"Yes, the gurgles help Charlie.",S02E03,15
The same way that the sports section helps your dad.,S02E03,16
Look at this garbage,S02E03,17
Brightly colored singing and dancing shapes.,S02E03,18
Would you guys just go upstairs?,S02E03,19
"If she isn't potty-trained by tomorrow,",S02E03,20
she won't get into the good preschool.,S02E03,21
-Come on! -But then we're gonna have to unhook the game system.,S02E03,22
Down here and rehook it up there.,S02E03,23
We already walked all the way down here.,S02E03,24
Are we supposed to rewalk all the way up there?,S02E03,25
"You know, we wouldn't have this problem",S02E03,26
if we had a tv in our room.,S02E03,27
"Okay, for the millionth time,",S02E03,28
I am not buying a tv for your room.,S02E03,29
Fine.,S02E03,30
"Let's go, P.",S02E03,31
J.,S02E03,32
"Ooh, hold on.",S02E03,33
The circle and the square are fighting over a grape.,S02E03,34
I want to see how this turns out.,S02E03,35
Today's all burnt toast ,S02E03,36
"Running late, and dad jokes",S02E03,37
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S02E03,38
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S02E03,39
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S02E03,40
There it is up on the roof,S02E03,41
"I've been there, I've survived",S02E03,42
So just take my advice,S02E03,43
"Hang in there, baby",S02E03,44
Things are crazy,S02E03,45
But I know your future's bright,S02E03,46
"Hang in there, baby",S02E03,47
There's no maybe,S02E03,48
Everything turns out all right,S02E03,49
Your life is up and down,S02E03,50
But trust me it comes back around,S02E03,51
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S02E03,52
"Hang in there, baby.",S02E03,53
Hey.,S02E03,54
Hey hey.,S02E03,55
"Hey, Mr.",S02E03,56
Duncan.,S02E03,57
"Hey, Ivy. You spending the night?",S02E03,58
"Yeah, our house is being fumigated.",S02E03,59
Oh.,S02E03,60
I guess your parents didn't know.,S02E03,61
That my company Bob's bugs be gone.,S02E03,62
Also does fumigations.,S02E03,63
"No, they knew that.",S02E03,64
"Oh, well, you know,",S02E03,65
It's too bad they didn't call.,S02E03,66
I could have given them a big discount.,S02E03,67
They knew that too.,S02E03,68
Oh.,S02E03,69
Okay.,S02E03,70
No biggie.,S02E03,71
What was that about?,S02E03,72
Who knows?,S02E03,73
"It's your fault for saying, hey, Mr.",S02E03,74
Duncan.,S02E03,75
So are you ready for the big news?,S02E03,76
Always.,S02E03,77
Here goes.,S02E03,78
-There's a guy. -There's a guy?,S02E03,79
-There's a guy. -There's a guy?!,S02E03,80
There's a guy!,S02E03,81
-Super happy dance.,S02E03,82
-Okay.,S02E03,83
super super,S02E03,84
happy dance.,S02E03,85
Happy!,S02E03,86
So who is he?,S02E03,87
He's that new guy in our government class Raymond.,S02E03,88
"Oh, he's cute.",S02E03,89
"Wait, so when did you start talking to him?",S02E03,90
"Well, we haven't actually talked yet.",S02E03,91
We've been iming.,S02E03,92
That led to texting.,S02E03,93
Tonight he wants to step it all the way up to video chat.,S02E03,94
I don't know if I'm ready.,S02E03,95
"All right, let's get you all cutied up for your video chat.",S02E03,96
"Um, if the bugs come back",S02E03,97
"I mean, when the bugs come back,",S02E03,98
This is my card.,S02E03,99
You know what? I'm gonna get you a coupon.,S02E03,100
You wait right there.,S02E03,101
Now's our chance. Go go go go!,S02E03,102
"All right, there we go.",S02E03,103
Brand new.,S02E03,104
Brand new.,S02E03,105
Look.,S02E03,106
Look at that.,S02E03,107
Now quack quack quack,S02E03,108
"When you're a big girl,",S02E03,109
This is where you're gonna go potty.,S02E03,110
Now just make sure the toilet seat is down.,S02E03,111
So you don't fall in.,S02E03,112
And hopefully you'll only make that mistake once,S02E03,113
"Well, unless you're P.",S02E03,114
J.,S02E03,115
And then it's many many times.,S02E03,116
"You know,",S02E03,117
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.,S02E03,118
Sometimes I come up here,S02E03,119
I don't even have to go.,S02E03,120
Sometimes daddy just needs a little vacation.,S02E03,121
Uh-oh.,S02E03,122
So what do you think?,S02E03,123
I don't know.,S02E03,124
"Ivy, Raymond will love you.",S02E03,125
"You look hot like, smoking hot.",S02E03,126
"Okay, now I see it.",S02E03,127
Okay.,S02E03,128
Now let's see how you look onscreen.,S02E03,129
Uh,S02E03,130
Pretty good.,S02E03,131
Just tilt down a little.,S02E03,132
I'm getting too much nostril.,S02E03,133
Better.,S02E03,134
Better.,S02E03,135
Now let's see some shoulder.,S02E03,136
"Ah, perfect.",S02E03,137
Now flutter your eyes.,S02E03,138
Now don't do that.,S02E03,139
Smile.,S02E03,140
Less teeth.,S02E03,141
More teeth.,S02E03,142
Less teeth.,S02E03,143
That's it.,S02E03,144
That's it.,S02E03,145
That's it.,S02E03,146
Now don't move.,S02E03,147
Look right in the camera.,S02E03,148
And tell Raymond what's on your mind.,S02E03,149
I think I'm stuck.,S02E03,150
"Honey,",S02E03,151
"I try never to ask you this after you exit the bathroom,",S02E03,152
But what was that horrible sound I heard a few minutes ago?,S02E03,153
"Charlie just threw some things in the toilet, clogged up the pipes.",S02E03,154
"So I just gotta dig a little hole in the backyard,",S02E03,155
Clean out the main line.,S02E03,156
Don't worry.,S02E03,157
Everything is gonna be fine.,S02E03,158
Should I call a plumber?,S02E03,159
Absolutely not.,S02E03,160
I have got this all under control.,S02E03,161
Where's Charlie?,S02E03,162
I'll be right back.,S02E03,163
"As long as he looks scared, I've done my job.",S02E03,164
"Boys, would you turn down that tv in your room?",S02E03,165
Tv in your room?,S02E03,166
"Oh, mama don't think so.",S02E03,167
What is this?,S02E03,168
A free tv.,S02E03,169
-Ha ha! -Isn't it awesome?,S02E03,170
It was just sitting on someone's lawn.,S02E03,171
"Yeah, there was a sign that said please take,",S02E03,172
So we took.,S02E03,173
"It's a little big for the room, don't you think?",S02E03,174
"Yeah, it was at first, but then",S02E03,175
Gabe came up with the brilliant idea.,S02E03,176
Of bunk desks.,S02E03,177
Bunk desks.,S02E03,178
Right right.,S02E03,179
Where's your dresser?,S02E03,180
-Under P.,S02E03,181
J.,S02E03,182
's bed.,S02E03,183
"-Yeah, at first I was concerned.",S02E03,184
That getting a fresh pair of underpants every day was gonna be a little tricky.,S02E03,185
But then I came up with a solution,S02E03,186
The underpants pillow.,S02E03,187
-Bam! -Buh-bam!,S02E03,188
Every time I come in here I regret it.,S02E03,189
Oh! Oh oh oh!,S02E03,190
Argh! Argh!,S02E03,191
Uh-oh.,S02E03,192
What happened?,S02E03,193
The power went out and the plumbing.,S02E03,194
"Well, how did that happen?",S02E03,195
Let's ask the soaking wet man with the pickaxe.,S02E03,196
"Hey, everybody.",S02E03,197
"Dad, when is the power coming back on?",S02E03,198
"Yeah, I'm 15 minutes away from a video chat.",S02E03,199
"And if we're gonna potty-train Charlie,",S02E03,200
she has to watch the gurgles.,S02E03,201
"Uh, first of all, I'm fine.",S02E03,202
"What? No, didn't get electrocuted.",S02E03,203
Thanks for the concern.,S02E03,204
What about the water?,S02E03,205
"All right,",S02E03,206
I've already called the plumber and the electrician,S02E03,207
"Oh, there we go.",S02E03,208
Okay.,S02E03,209
Who can't be here until tomorrow,S02E03,210
-What? Bob! -Ish.,S02E03,211
Come on. Hey hey hey!,S02E03,212
We can survive one night without water and power.,S02E03,213
"Come on, it's gonna be fine.",S02E03,214
I heard some kind of explosion and rushed right over.,S02E03,215
To see if Gabe was anywhere near the blast.,S02E03,216
"I'm right here, Mrs. Dabney,",S02E03,217
Better than ever.,S02E03,218
Are you sure? No internal injuries?,S02E03,219
My stomach is kind of upset.,S02E03,220
Might be a touch of dabnerrhea.,S02E03,221
All right.,S02E03,222
Mrs.,S02E03,223
"Dabney, you know,.",S02E03,224
We're gonna be without water and power for a while.,S02E03,225
It sure would be helpful if we could use your bathroom.,S02E03,226
Till ours is up and running.,S02E03,227
I don't even let Mr.,S02E03,228
Dabney use my bathroom.,S02E03,229
"Okay, Mrs. Dabney, I know it's an imposition,",S02E03,230
But the thing is we have a really important.,S02E03,231
Preschool interview tomorrow morning.,S02E03,232
And it sure would be nice,S02E03,233
if we could use your bathroom.,S02E03,234
To freshen up beforehand.,S02E03,235
"-Need to freshen up, huh? -Yeah.",S02E03,236
I hear the bus station has a real nice bathroom.,S02E03,237
Have a good night now.,S02E03,238
Gabriel Duncan! Dabnerrhea?,S02E03,239
Yeah.,S02E03,240
Up top.,S02E03,241
Bob.,S02E03,242
Hey.,S02E03,243
Remember when you said we wouldn't need this?,S02E03,244
Who looks stupid now?,S02E03,245
Which question should I answer first?,S02E03,246
Any progress on the potty-training?,S02E03,247
"Nope,",S02E03,248
"without the gurgles Charlie won't even sit on that potty,",S02E03,249
And the interview is in 12 hours.,S02E03,250
"Oh, she'll get it.",S02E03,251
That's the thing about us Duncans,S02E03,252
We're clutch players.,S02E03,253
I see the light's on.,S02E03,254
I'm not sure anybody's home.,S02E03,255
Where are the kids?,S02E03,256
Charlie's taking a nap.,S02E03,257
Teddy and Ivy are downstairs.,S02E03,258
And the boys are in their room reading.,S02E03,259
P.,S02E03,260
J.,S02E03,261
And Gabe are reading?.,S02E03,262
"Yeah, it was their idea.",S02E03,263
So they're reading voluntarily?,S02E03,264
Huh.,S02E03,265
Let's roll.,S02E03,266
Oh!,S02E03,267
"Sorry, I should have warned you about that.",S02E03,268
What is going on in here?,S02E03,269
Great news the power is back on.,S02E03,270
"Well, it is for us.",S02E03,271
Where are you getting your power from?,S02E03,272
"Hey, are you stealing electricity from Mrs. Dabney?",S02E03,273
Are we in trouble?,S02E03,274
What's taking those nachos so long?,S02E03,275
There really is a lot of stuff plugged in. Are you sure this is safe?,S02E03,276
"Ah, the problem.",S02E03,277
We've got a loose connection.,S02E03,278
Everything's under control.,S02E03,279
"Huh, that's weird.",S02E03,280
Mrs.,S02E03,281
Dabney's power is out too.,S02E03,282
"Oh look, here she comes.",S02E03,283
"You know, for an older gal,",S02E03,284
she moves pretty fast.,S02E03,285
Nachos?,S02E03,286
Raymond will think I blew him off.,S02E03,287
I probably lost him forever.,S02E03,288
Now I'm gonna die sad and alone.,S02E03,289
"Ivy, you're not gonna die alone.",S02E03,290
You can live with me and my husband.,S02E03,291
In our pool house.,S02E03,292
"No offense, but that sounds awful.",S02E03,293
"Well, not for me.",S02E03,294
I have a husband and a pool house.,S02E03,295
You could just call Raymond.,S02E03,296
"Mom, we can't do that.",S02E03,297
Our cell phones are dead and we can't charge them.,S02E03,298
Use the wall phone.,S02E03,299
It works without electricity.,S02E03,300
The wall what?,S02E03,301
The wall phone,S02E03,302
"You know, the phone.",S02E03,303
On the wall.,S02E03,304
When did we get that?,S02E03,305
When we bought the house.,S02E03,306
Just one problem,S02E03,307
Raymond's number is in my phone.,S02E03,308
"Well, if you know his last name,",S02E03,309
-Just look him up in the phonebook. -The phone what?,S02E03,310
"Okay, now you can see what it was like.",S02E03,311
"To live life in the olden days,",S02E03,312
Also known as the 9os.,S02E03,313
Huh.,S02E03,314
Here's Raymond's number.,S02E03,315
-What? -Yeah.,S02E03,316
Okay.,S02E03,317
"Oh, it's right there.",S02E03,318
"Oh, right here?",S02E03,319
It's ringing.,S02E03,320
-I can't do this.,S02E03,321
-Ivy.,S02E03,322
-I'm just not ready.,S02E03,323
-Don't give it to me.,S02E03,324
What am I supposed to? Hello.,S02E03,325
"Raymond, hi.",S02E03,326
"Hi, it's Teddy.",S02E03,327
Ivy's best friend.,S02E03,328
"Yeah, I'm sure you've heard all about me.",S02E03,329
Oh really?,S02E03,330
Not a thing?,S02E03,331
"Anyways,",S02E03,332
Sorry we missed the video chat.,S02E03,333
"There were some technical difficulties,",S02E03,334
"So I don't know if you and Ivy are gonna be able to talk tonight,",S02E03,335
Unless unless you want to come over.,S02E03,336
Ivy loves the idea.,S02E03,337
Ivy's at 358 edgewood.,S02E03,338
"Okay, bye.",S02E03,339
He's on his way over.,S02E03,340
"What are you doing, t? I told you I wasn't ready.",S02E03,341
But you like him.,S02E03,342
He likes you.,S02E03,343
"Now get your Booty in gear, girl,",S02E03,344
'cause it's time to represent.,S02E03,345
Huh-uh.,S02E03,346
"Don't go street on me, t.",S02E03,347
It's just sad.,S02E03,348
Ready for operation potty train?,S02E03,349
-It's go time.,S02E03,350

"Okay, P.",S02E03,352
J.,S02E03,353
", let's hit it.",S02E03,354
"Okay, hey, Charlie, you want to watch some tv?",S02E03,355
-Yeah.,S02E03,356
-I bet your favorite show is on.,S02E03,357
I bet yeah.,S02E03,358
It's time to giggle,S02E03,359
With the gurgles!,S02E03,360
"Hi there, kids.",S02E03,361
Today is gonna be a super-duper day.,S02E03,362
Why is that?,S02E03,363
Because we're gonna do the potty rap.,S02E03,364
"Hey there, kids, don't be naughty",S02E03,365
Let's have fun and use our potty,S02E03,366
Going to the potty can be so gnarly,S02E03,367
Especially if you're a girl named Charlie.,S02E03,368
"Oh gosh, mommy.",S02E03,369
"Well, that didn't work.",S02E03,370
Actually it worked for me.,S02E03,371
See ya.,S02E03,372
-Hi.,S02E03,373
-Hi.,S02E03,374
-I'm Raymond.,S02E03,375
"-Hi, I'm Teddy.",S02E03,376
Come on in.,S02E03,377
"Ivy, Raymond's here.",S02E03,378
It's kind of dark in here.,S02E03,379
"Yeah, we're having a power outage.",S02E03,380
Could I offer you some chunky milk.,S02E03,381
Or a glass of ice cream?,S02E03,382
"Uh, I'm cool. Can I use the bathroom?",S02E03,383
No.,S02E03,384
The water's out too.,S02E03,385
"Oh, nice place.",S02E03,386
I'm gonna see what's keeping Ivy.,S02E03,387
Just have a seat right there. Ivy!,S02E03,388
Enjoying myself so far.,S02E03,389
What's going on?,S02E03,390
What if I say something stupid? Then he won't like me.,S02E03,391
"Ivy, you say stupid stuff to me all the time.",S02E03,392
And I still like you.,S02E03,393
"I'm serious, t.",S02E03,394
This is the first guy I've ever really liked.,S02E03,395
I don't want to mess it up.,S02E03,396
"Come on, you can do this.",S02E03,397
I can't.,S02E03,398
I just know if I look into those big brown eyes,S02E03,399
I'm gonna freeze.,S02E03,400
So you don't want to see his eyes.,S02E03,401
I can work with that.,S02E03,402
Ivy will be right out.,S02E03,403
"Meanwhile, let's enjoy.",S02E03,404
Some nice battery-powered music,S02E03,405
Kicking it old school.,S02E03,406
Like they did back in the diz-ay.,S02E03,407
"Oh, Teddy, right.",S02E03,408
Ivy did mention you.,S02E03,409
"Okay, Ivy, come on out.",S02E03,410
There she is.,S02E03,411
Now Raymond is right over there by the couch.,S02E03,412
"Hey, how is it going?",S02E03,413
Good.,S02E03,414
Okay.,S02E03,415
"Raymond, doesn't Ivy look nice?",S02E03,416
I can't see her.,S02E03,417
Take my word for it.,S02E03,418
Okay.,S02E03,419
"Ivy, you look good",S02E03,420
Probably.,S02E03,421
Thanks.,S02E03,422
There you go.,S02E03,423
This is good.,S02E03,424
"Okay, come on, guys.",S02E03,425
You've got to keep it up.,S02E03,426
We were on a nice roll there.,S02E03,427
All right?,S02E03,428
Still just me talking.,S02E03,429
Still just,S02E03,430
"Guys, what's going on over there?",S02E03,431
"Oh, okay.",S02E03,432
Don't need any light for that.,S02E03,433
I'll just I'll be in the kitchen.,S02E03,434
"Oh! Argh, that's my shin.",S02E03,435
I'm okay.,S02E03,436
I'm totally okay.,S02E03,437
Don't worry.,S02E03,438
Ow!,S02E03,439
Forehead too.,S02E03,440
"Okay, sweetheart.",S02E03,441
Why don't you go over there.,S02E03,442
"-And play with some toys, okay? -Okay.",S02E03,443
What is that smell?,S02E03,444
"That would be me,",S02E03,445
Because somebody said we didn't have enough time.,S02E03,446
To stop off at the bus station to freshen up.,S02E03,447
"Oh, so it's my fault?",S02E03,448
"My stink is your fault, yeah.",S02E03,449
That makes a lot of sense. Tonight when we're done here,S02E03,450
I'm gonna drop you off at the bus station.,S02E03,451
You can stay there.,S02E03,452
-And freshen up all night long.,S02E03,453
-All night long? Sounds good to me.,S02E03,454
-Hi.,S02E03,455
-Sorry to keep you waiting.,S02E03,456
I'm Sondra.,S02E03,457
"Hi, I'm Amy.",S02E03,458
This is Bob.,S02E03,459
And this is Charlie.,S02E03,460
What?,S02E03,461
Something wrong with your face?,S02E03,462
"No, there's some kind of odor.",S02E03,463
"Oh, that's my husband.",S02E03,464
"Yeah, guilty as charged.",S02E03,465
We're having some plumbing issues at our house,S02E03,466
and we weren't able to shower.,S02E03,467
"Yeah, that explains why I smell like a hobo.",S02E03,468
Not that there's anything wrong with hobos.,S02E03,469
"No no no, some of my best friends are hobos.",S02E03,470
Yeah.,S02E03,471
Why don't we talk about Charlie?,S02E03,472
-Great idea.,S02E03,473
-Okay.,S02E03,474
So how old is Charlie?,S02E03,475
Already two.,S02E03,476
Is she still napping?,S02E03,477
"Most days in the afternoon, yes.",S02E03,478
Is she potty-trained?,S02E03,479
"-Oh, of course.",S02E03,480
-Absolutely.,S02E03,481
"Yeah, potty train has left the station.",S02E03,482
Absolutely.,S02E03,483
"Yes, sir.",S02E03,484
Whoo-whoo!.,S02E03,485
I'm sorry about that.,S02E03,486
"Charlie sweetheart, can you turn the tv off?",S02E03,487
That's okay.,S02E03,488
The little ones sure love those gurgles.,S02E03,489
-It's her favorite show.,S02E03,490
-Gurgles.,S02E03,491
No-o-o!,S02E03,492
So the potty train hasn't left the station.,S02E03,493
Whoo-whoo.,S02E03,494
"Well, Charlie, looks like.",S02E03,495
Before you spend any time in preschool.,S02E03,496
You're gonna need to spend a little more time.,S02E03,497
In pee school.,S02E03,498
Sorry.,S02E03,499
"It was either that or new school-poo school,",S02E03,500
"And I decided to go classy, so",S02E03,501
"Watch it, you idiot.",S02E03,502
"Speaking of classy, sounds like your brothers are home.",S02E03,503
"One, two, three.",S02E03,504
What is that?,S02E03,505
80-inch big screen.,S02E03,506
We found it in the alley.,S02E03,507
We're gonna put it on top of the other one.,S02E03,508
We're gonna make bunk tvs.,S02E03,509
They'll be out of the house by the time you're my age.,S02E03,510
"And if not, then good luck, Charlie.",S02E03,511
Duncans' double decker warehouse. ,S02E03,512
-House too small? -Family too big?,S02E03,513
Then come on down to Duncans' double Decker furniture warehouse.,S02E03,514
For all your stacked furniture needs.,S02E03,515
Wouldn't it be great if your couch could seat eight?,S02E03,516
Got a full bladder? It doesn't matter.,S02E03,517
Remember that's Duncans double Decker furniture warehouse.,S02E03,518
Stacking furniture since 2011.,S02E03,519
Charlie not included.,S02E03,520
-Hey! -There you are.,S02E04,0
So what's the big news and why didn't you just text me?,S02E04,1
Because I wanted to see the expression on your face,S02E04,2
"When I told you-- okay, here goes:",S02E04,3
So that really hot senior Josh,S02E04,4
Invited me to his party this weekend.,S02E04,5
And he said I could bring a friend.,S02E04,6
So tell me how it all went down.,S02E04,7
Okay okay okay.,S02E04,8
So I was standing at my locker when Josh asked me.,S02E04,9
I got so nervous I closed my hair in the door,S02E04,10
And I had to stand there like this.,S02E04,11
Wait a minute.,S02E04,12
Our moms will never let us go to a senior party.,S02E04,13
-Already solved that.,S02E04,14
"-Ooh, we're gonna lie.",S02E04,15
We can't.,S02E04,16
You're a terrible liar.,S02E04,17
I am not.,S02E04,18
Yeah you are.,S02E04,19
"Whenever you lie, your voice gets really high.",S02E04,20
huh-uh!,S02E04,21
"Okay, so here's the plan.",S02E04,22
You know that app that lets you create fake phone calls?,S02E04,23
That what that creates what?,S02E04,24
There's a phone app that you can create fake phone calls with.,S02E04,25
All I have to do is record my mom saying some stuff,S02E04,26
That sounds like she's giving me permission to go to the party.,S02E04,27
"Ah, then when my mom hears it",S02E04,28
-She'll let me go.,S02E04,29
-Exactly.,S02E04,30
And we go to the party and Josh falls in love with me.,S02E04,31
"Oh, and his cute best friend falls in love with me,",S02E04,32
"But I tell him that I have a boyfriend,",S02E04,33
But he doesn't take no for an answer--,S02E04,34
-Are you done? -And then,S02E04,35
There's a third guy that gets interested,S02E04,36
Today's all burnt toast ,S02E04,37
"Running late, and dad jokes",S02E04,38
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S02E04,39
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S02E04,40
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S02E04,41
There it is up on the roof,S02E04,42
"I've been there, I've survived",S02E04,43
So just take my advice,S02E04,44
"Hang in there, baby",S02E04,45
Things are crazy,S02E04,46
But I know your future's bright,S02E04,47
"Hang in there, baby",S02E04,48
There's no maybe,S02E04,49
Everything turns out all right,S02E04,50
Your life is up and down,S02E04,51
But trust me it comes back around,S02E04,52
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S02E04,53
"Hang in there, baby.",S02E04,54
"Oh, Charlie.",S02E04,55
"You know daddy loves you,",S02E04,56
But daddy's played baby about 100 times,S02E04,57
And he doesn't feel so good.,S02E04,58
He needs to rest.,S02E04,59
"Oh, okay.",S02E04,60
All right.,S02E04,61
"Oh, I know! Let's play",S02E04,62
Baby watches daddy take a nap.,S02E04,63
"Aha! Boys, I need your help.",S02E04,64
-Really? -Today at work I got bit by a spider.,S02E04,65
You're an exterminator. Doesn't that happen every day?,S02E04,66
"Well, this particular spider I happen to be mildly allergic to.",S02E04,67
That's disgusting!,S02E04,68
"Cover it, cover it, cover it.",S02E04,69
"Please, I think I'm gonna barf.",S02E04,70
Thank you so much for your concern.,S02E04,71
I went and I saw the doctor.,S02E04,72
She says the swelling's going to be gone in a couple of days.,S02E04,73
"Oh, that's revolting.",S02E04,74
Although it does make your tummy look smaller.,S02E04,75
"gosh, dad, how could I help?",S02E04,76
thanks for asking.,S02E04,77
P.,S02E04,78
J.,S02E04,79
", I need you to cover for me at work tomorrow.",S02E04,80
I got a really busy day.,S02E04,81
"Fine, I'll help.",S02E04,82
But I better not get a giant arm too.,S02E04,83
I just bought some shirts.,S02E04,84
"Gabe, I gotta go upstairs and rest,",S02E04,85
"So I need you to look after Charlie, okay?",S02E04,86
What am I supposed to do with Charlie?,S02E04,87
Wha-- you play baby with her.,S02E04,88
"Come on, she loves it.",S02E04,89
Fetch.,S02E04,90
"Okay, Ivy, I'm about to launch phase one of operation fool mom.",S02E04,91
What?  No. I don't know what,S02E04,92
I'm gonna wear to the party.,S02E04,93
Let's trick our moms first.,S02E04,94
-Hi mom.,S02E04,95
-Hey.,S02E04,96
"What?  Mom,",S02E04,97
I haven't seen you all day and all I get is a hey?,S02E04,98
"Sorry. Hi, Teddy!",S02E04,99
"Uh, mom, could you get this loose thread on my sweater?",S02E04,100
"-Where is it? -Oh, must have fallen off.",S02E04,101
Threads.,S02E04,102
Go figure.,S02E04,103
How are you doing?,S02E04,104
"Fine. Oh, mom,",S02E04,105
Could I ask you a personal question?,S02E04,106
"Honey, of course you can.",S02E04,107
Great.,S02E04,108
What's-- what's-- what's the question?,S02E04,109
"Oh, I don't have one right now.",S02E04,110
Just,S02E04,111
"You know, good to know for down the road.",S02E04,112
"Seriously, how are you doing?",S02E04,113
"Oh, mom, you took Spanish, right?",S02E04,114
What does this mean?,S02E04,115
That means I like that boy.,S02E04,116
He's very nice.,S02E04,117
"Wait a minute, I thought you were taking french.",S02E04,118
"Oh, wow.",S02E04,119
Guess that's why I didn't understand it.,S02E04,120
"-I love you, mom.",S02E04,121
"-I love you too, honey.",S02E04,122
Weird-- I usually have those conversations with P.,S02E04,123
J.,S02E04,124
"Dad, make it stop.",S02E04,125
-Make what stop? -Play baby.,S02E04,126
That.,S02E04,127
"Everywhere I go there she is play baby,",S02E04,128
"Play baby, play baby.",S02E04,129
"I'm sorry, son, but somebody has finally found you likeable.",S02E04,130
"Well, I can't take it anymore.",S02E04,131
I'm going to the library.,S02E04,132
"-The library? -Yeah, dad.",S02E04,133
It's come to that.,S02E04,134
-Do you even know where the library is? -I'll find it.,S02E04,135
She's coming!,S02E04,136
"Okay, are you ready with your phone?",S02E04,137
Ready.,S02E04,138
"-Oh, hi, Mrs.",S02E04,139
Wentz.,S02E04,140
"-Hi, Teddy.",S02E04,141
"-Ivy, didn't you hear me? -No.",S02E04,142
I have been honking and screaming ivy for 10 minutes.,S02E04,143
That was you?,S02E04,144
I know so many people.,S02E04,145
-Let's go.,S02E04,146
"-Before that, quick question.",S02E04,147
-What? -There's a senior boy named Josh,S02E04,148
And he invited Teddy and me to a party this weekend. Can I go?,S02E04,149
"Now, Ivy, you know my policy.",S02E04,150
"Unless I've met the boy, the answer's no.",S02E04,151
And I'm sure Teddy's mom said the same thing.,S02E04,152
"Oh well, actually I haven't asked my mom yet.",S02E04,153
"Oh hey, why don't I call my mom at work and see what she says?",S02E04,154
It's ringing.,S02E04,155
"-Hi, mom.",S02E04,156
"-Hi, Teddy.",S02E04,157
"Uh, mom, I was calling to see if I can go to a party?",S02E04,158
-Where is it? -It's at my friend Josh's house.,S02E04,159
"You know Josh, right?",S02E04,160
I like that boy.,S02E04,161
He's very nice.,S02E04,162
So what do you say? Can I go to the party?,S02E04,163
"Honey, of course you can.",S02E04,164
"Thanks, mom.",S02E04,165
You're the best.,S02E04,166
"All right, I don't want to keep you. Love you!",S02E04,167
"Love you too, honey.",S02E04,168
See?,S02E04,169
Teddy gets to go.,S02E04,170
"Well, if it's okay with Amy.",S02E04,171
It's okay with me.,S02E04,172
You can go.,S02E04,173
"Thanks, mom.",S02E04,174
You're the best.,S02E04,175
I like that boy.,S02E04,176
He's very nice.,S02E04,177
What was that?,S02E04,178
"Oh, I was just doing an impression of my mom.",S02E04,179
I also do my dad.,S02E04,180
"Teddy, get in here!",S02E04,181
"What is it, dad?",S02E04,182
who ate the last donut?,S02E04,183
"You did, dad.",S02E04,184
"well, we'd better get going.",S02E04,185
"Mmm, what smells so good?",S02E04,186
-Hot dogs.,S02E04,187
-Oh.,S02E04,188
Nothing makes boiled water smell better,S02E04,189
Than Amy Duncan's hot dogs.,S02E04,190
This should be good.,S02E04,191
"Um, so, mom,",S02E04,192
I was wondering if I could go to a party at Josh's house.,S02E04,193
He's this really cute senior.,S02E04,194
You don't know him.,S02E04,195
"I'm sorry, Teddy, the answer's no.",S02E04,196
You know my policy.,S02E04,197
"Oh, come on! Ivy's mom is letting her go.",S02E04,198
-Mary Lou wentz gave permission? -Yes.,S02E04,199
"Yes, she did.",S02E04,200
And I can call her if you want to hear from her.,S02E04,201
I'd love to.,S02E04,202
"Hi, Mrs.",S02E04,203
"Wentz, it's Teddy Duncan.",S02E04,204
"I'm gonna put you on speaker, okay?",S02E04,205
"So, Mrs. Wentz, you're letting Ivy go to that party, right?",S02E04,206
It's okay with me.,S02E04,207
"Are you sure, Mary Lou, because--",S02E04,208
it's okay with me.,S02E04,209
"Really, you're not the least bit--",S02E04,210
it's okay with me.,S02E04,211
"Oops, lost her.",S02E04,212
So can I go to the party?,S02E04,213
Well,S02E04,214
"If it's okay with Mary Lou, it's okay with me.",S02E04,215
"Ooh, thank you, mommy! Love you so much.",S02E04,216
Yeah No one loves mom more than when she's saying yes.,S02E04,217
That was an interesting phone call.,S02E04,218
Was it?,S02E04,219
Yeah.,S02E04,220
"Yeah, it was.",S02E04,221
"Having fun yet, kid?",S02E04,222
"No, vern, I am not.",S02E04,223
First time in a crawl space?,S02E04,224
I can't believe my dad does this for a living.,S02E04,225
I'm really gonna have to start,S02E04,226
paying attention in school.,S02E04,227
Shh!,S02E04,228
"Uh-oh, rats.",S02E04,229
Rats?,S02E04,230
I thought we were catching possums.,S02E04,231
Sometimes the critters make the decisions.,S02E04,232
- Where are the rats? - All around us.,S02E04,233
dozens.,S02E04,234
Maybe hundreds.,S02E04,235
"Quiet. If they smell fear,",S02E04,236
We're both dead.,S02E04,237
That was horrifying.,S02E04,238
"Pass the salt, kid.",S02E04,239
"Uh, that's termite poison.",S02E04,240
You only put that on a sandwich once.,S02E04,241
Whoops.,S02E04,242
Sorry.,S02E04,243
"Well, it's nice to finally meet you.",S02E04,244
Your dad sure talks about you a lot.,S02E04,245
-He does? -All the time.,S02E04,246
"Goes on and on about you-- how you're smart,",S02E04,247
"Driven, popular.",S02E04,248
-He said all that about me? -Oh yeah.,S02E04,249
He's very proud.,S02E04,250
"Well, lunch break's over, Ted.",S02E04,251
Ted? Ted?!,S02E04,252
"Oh, Teddy's my sister.",S02E04,253
"Oh, then you must be the self-confident",S02E04,254
Sharp-as-a-tack mischief-maker.,S02E04,255
That's Gabe.,S02E04,256
Hmm.,S02E04,257
You're the little cutie pie who just got out of diapers?,S02E04,258
I'm the oldest!,S02E04,259
- P.,S02E04,260
J.,S02E04,261
"? - Oh right, of course.",S02E04,262
P.,S02E04,263
J.,S02E04,264
-- You're the nice one.,S02E04,265
That's it?,S02E04,266
"Everyone else is sharp,",S02E04,267
Smart and adorable,S02E04,268
And I'm just nice?,S02E04,269
I know what'll turn that frown upside down.,S02E04,270
You get to carry the rat bag.,S02E04,271
"-Hi, Amy.",S02E04,272
"-Hi, Mary Lou! Come on in.",S02E04,273
- Okay. - What brings you here?,S02E04,274
Ivy forgot her boa.,S02E04,275
"Now if she's going to a party, she needs her boa.",S02E04,276
"They just left, but don't worry--",S02E04,277
The leopard-print dress will be festive enough.,S02E04,278
"I gotta say, Amy, I was a bit surprised",S02E04,279
You gave Teddy permission to go to that party.,S02E04,280
"Well, I only said yes to Teddy",S02E04,281
because you gave Ivy permission first.,S02E04,282
You know how much I respect you as a mother. Cracker?,S02E04,283
"Oh, thank you.",S02E04,284
But you gave Teddy permission first,S02E04,285
And I said yes because of how much I respect you.,S02E04,286
"Okay, yeah yeah yeah, best moms ever.",S02E04,287
I'm trying to watch my cartoons here.,S02E04,288
I-- I didn't give Teddy permission first.,S02E04,289
But I heard Teddy call you at work.,S02E04,290
"No, Teddy never called me at work.",S02E04,291
I'm confused.,S02E04,292
"-Yeah, me too. -May I enlighten you?",S02E04,293
-Spill it. -The girls used a phone app to make it sound like,S02E04,294
You each gave them permission to go to the party.,S02E04,295
-What? -They didn't!,S02E04,296
"Oh, Mary Lou, but they did.",S02E04,297
"Now, mom, so next time I'm bad--",S02E04,298
we both know there will be a next time--,S02E04,299
Just remember this moment when I did something for you.,S02E04,300
They are gonna be in so much trouble when they get home.,S02E04,301
Why wait till they get home?,S02E04,302
They're not the only ones who know about apps.,S02E04,303
"No, they aren't.",S02E04,304
What do we know about apps?,S02E04,305
I have a g.,S02E04,306
P.,S02E04,307
S.,S02E04,308
App on this phone.,S02E04,309
That means I can track Ivy's phone.,S02E04,310
Shall we go to a party?,S02E04,311
I'd be appy to.,S02E04,312
hello?,S02E04,313
"Teddy dear, Gabe here.",S02E04,314
"Before I share the news,",S02E04,315
let's remember this moment the next time I need a favor.,S02E04,316
Why do all of your calls start with the same creepy question?,S02E04,317
Mom and Mrs.,S02E04,318
Wentz know all about the phony phone calls.,S02E04,319
What?! How'd they find out?,S02E04,320
That part remains a mystery. Anywho,S02E04,321
They're tracking you on g.,S02E04,322
P.,S02E04,323
S.,S02E04,324
And heading your way.,S02E04,325
What?  Our moms are tracking us on g.,S02E04,326
P.,S02E04,327
S.,S02E04,328
G.,S02E04,329
P.,S02E04,330
S.,S02E04,331
? They're not supposed to know about that.,S02E04,332
"Oh gosh, thanks, Gabe.",S02E04,333
I owe you one.,S02E04,334
So it would seem.,S02E04,335
There you are.,S02E04,336
I think Charlie wants to play baby with you.,S02E04,337
"She keeps going, gabe, Gabe!",S02E04,338
She can say it all she wants.,S02E04,339
It's not gonna happen.,S02E04,340
I'm sick of her and I'm sick of that stupid doll.,S02E04,341
"Oh, Charlie, come on! I didn't mean it.",S02E04,342
I was just Gabe being Gabe.,S02E04,343
"Hey, there he is! How'd it go today?",S02E04,344
the highlight of my day,S02E04,345
Was carrying a bag of rats.,S02E04,346
Vern must like you,S02E04,347
because he's awful particular about his rat bag.,S02E04,348
Vern told me what you said about us kids.,S02E04,349
-What'd I say? -That everyone else is so great,S02E04,350
And I'm just nice.,S02E04,351
So?,S02E04,352
"You're nice, what's wrong with that?",S02E04,353
So nice is what your friend calls the ugly girl,S02E04,354
He wants you to go out with.,S02E04,355
Is that all I am to you--,S02E04,356
An ugly girl?,S02E04,357
"Oh, this is so exciting--",S02E04,358
Going after the perps.,S02E04,359
"Wait, the girls are turning around.",S02E04,360
- What? - Looks like they're headed back to your house.,S02E04,361
"Hold on your your purse, Mary Lou.",S02E04,362
We're making a u-ey.,S02E04,363
Oh yeah!,S02E04,364
- You know what would be great? - What?,S02E04,365
If we had a siren and a flashing light.,S02E04,366
They got app for everything.,S02E04,367
Hey.,S02E04,368
-I think we gotta talk.,S02E04,369
-I'm not in the mood.,S02E04,370
"Oh, that wasn't very nice.",S02E04,371
Oh come on.,S02E04,372
When I said you were nice that was a compliment.,S02E04,373
That was the best thing you could say about me?,S02E04,374
I think that says a lot.,S02E04,375
"Look, P.",S02E04,376
J.,S02E04,377
",.",S02E04,378
"As a father, the most important thing to me",S02E04,379
Is that my kids are good people--,S02E04,380
"Kind-hearted, genuinely concerned about other people",S02E04,381
Nice.,S02E04,382
"Hey, by that standard you're the kid I'm most proud of.",S02E04,383
-Really? -Really.,S02E04,384
"Thanks, dad.",S02E04,385
"Hey, thank you for helping me out on the job today.",S02E04,386
"Uh, you know, I was kinda",S02E04,387
Hoping maybe someday we could,S02E04,388
Make that a permanent thing.,S02E04,389
Duncan & son.,S02E04,390
Oh!,S02E04,391
That reminds me-- better hit those books.,S02E04,392
"Well, that wasn't nice at all.",S02E04,393
"Oh, what are you two doing here? Did the party end early?",S02E04,394
"No, we decided not to go.",S02E04,395
The truth is,S02E04,396
We tricked you into giving us permission to go to the party.,S02E04,397
Did you now?,S02E04,398
"Yes, I'm ashamed to say we did.",S02E04,399
But on the way there something made us change our minds.,S02E04,400
And what's that?,S02E04,401
We saw the grape juice billboard.,S02E04,402
You know the one where the girl is hugging her mom,S02E04,403
Because she's so happy with the juice?,S02E04,404
"grape moms think alike, I'm familiar with it.",S02E04,405
Anyway that got us to thinking about how wonderful you two are,S02E04,406
And we talked it over,S02E04,407
and agreed that you deserved better,S02E04,408
And decided not to go.,S02E04,409
It's true.,S02E04,410
"Anyway, we know you're probably gonna punish us,",S02E04,411
But we're okay with that.,S02E04,412
"Well, we can talk about that later.",S02E04,413
I'm really proud that you guys told us the truth.,S02E04,414
I am too.,S02E04,415
Darn you for raising us so well.,S02E04,416
It's what I do.,S02E04,417
"Hey, Ivy, I'm on my way out. Are you here?",S02E04,418
I'm right in front of your house.,S02E04,419
Are you sure it's not too late to go?,S02E04,420
"Oh, girlfriend, these senior parties go all night.",S02E04,421
-Going somewhere? -Back to bed.,S02E04,422
You got that right.,S02E04,423
Caught by mom.,S02E04,424
Can't go.,S02E04,425
"-If you're not going, I'm not going.",S02E04,426
-You got that right.,S02E04,427
"Hi, Charlie.",S02E04,428
"Charlie, come on.",S02E04,429
How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?,S02E04,430
What is it gonna take for you to forgive me?,S02E04,431
You baby.,S02E04,432
you baby?,S02E04,433
What does that mean?,S02E04,434
"Well, Charlie, I don't know how you got him to do that,",S02E04,435
But thank you.,S02E04,436
We'll be enjoying this for years.,S02E04,437
"now say good luck, Charlie.",S02E04,438
Do you want me to spit up? cause I'm not afraid to go there.,S02E04,439
Cranky baby.,S02E04,440
"Hey, how's it going? Good good.",S02E04,441
Remember a few weeks ago I mentioned something about,S02E04,442
Cashing in my favors?,S02E04,443
"Well, today's the day.",S02E04,444
You two never saw me.,S02E04,445
Bye-bye now.,S02E04,446
come in.,S02E04,447
"He's upstairs, boys.",S02E04,448
"-Why'd you give him up, mom? -He didn't do the dishes.",S02E04,449
Don't cross mama.,S02E04,450
And now for the finishing touch,S02E05,0
Mr.,S02E05,1
Pancake smileyface gets a cherry nose.,S02E05,2
That's so cute. Is that for Charlie?,S02E05,3
"Uh, yeah, for Charlie.",S02E05,4
Thank you.,S02E05,5
"Hey, honey, I've got some great news.",S02E05,6
There was a bedbug infestation.,S02E05,7
At this really nice hotel downtown,S02E05,8
"Bob, it is amazing what gets you excited.",S02E05,9
"Anyway,",S02E05,10
the manager of the hotel was so pleased with the job I did.,S02E05,11
He's letting us stay,S02E05,12
in their most romantic suite this Saturday night.,S02E05,13
That's great!,S02E05,14
"You did get rid of all the bedbugs, right?",S02E05,15
"It's not an exact science, honey.",S02E05,16
The point is it's free!,S02E05,17
"Well, there's just one catch who's gonna watch Charlie?",S02E05,18
We'll do it.,S02E05,19
We're very responsible.,S02E05,20
Don't worry I'll be here too.,S02E05,21
-You guys are great. -All right!,S02E05,22
It sure is nice to have kids we can trust.,S02E05,23
And P.,S02E05,24
J.,S02E05,25
Let's throw a party! Wait what?,S02E05,26
"No, me first.",S02E05,27
I said let's throw a party.,S02E05,28
When mom and dad are out of the house.,S02E05,29
When do you ever do bad things?,S02E05,30
I can be bad.,S02E05,31
I can be very bad.,S02E05,32
-Cannot. -Oh yeah?,S02E05,33
-Uh-huh.,S02E05,34
-Watch this.,S02E05,35
I'm gonna drink milk right out of the carton.,S02E05,36
Because I'm bad.,S02E05,37
Are you gonna swallow?,S02E05,38
Huh-uh.,S02E05,39
-You wanna spit it out? -Mm-hmm.,S02E05,40
Today's all burnt toast ,S02E05,41
"Running late, and dad jokes",S02E05,42
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S02E05,43
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S02E05,44
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S02E05,45
There it is up on the roof,S02E05,46
"I've been there, I've survived",S02E05,47
So just take my advice,S02E05,48
"Hang in there, baby",S02E05,49
Things are crazy,S02E05,50
But I know your future's bright,S02E05,51
"Hang in there, baby",S02E05,52
There's no maybe,S02E05,53
Everything turns out all right,S02E05,54
Your life is up and down,S02E05,55
But trust me it comes back around,S02E05,56
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S02E05,57
"Hang in there, baby.",S02E05,58
"Mom, you wanna get that?",S02E05,59
Great! What's next?,S02E05,60
Making my own bed?,S02E05,61
"-Hey, Jo. -Why is your arm in a cast?",S02E05,62
"Oh, I broke my finger.",S02E05,63
"See, I was playing baseb",S02E05,64
"Okay, now back to me.",S02E05,65
My mom says I have to go.,S02E05,66
To this stupid thing called cotillion.,S02E05,67
It's a stupid class where they reach you manners,S02E05,68
and social graces.,S02E05,69
And other stupid stuff.,S02E05,70
And there's a stupid dance.,S02E05,71
And I have to bring a stupid date.,S02E05,72
So I thought of you.,S02E05,73
Pass.,S02E05,74
Bye-bye now.,S02E05,75
"Oh come on, Gabe.",S02E05,76
I think it'd be.,S02E05,77
A great idea for you to go to cotillion.,S02E05,78
"Oh, now you show up.",S02E05,79
"Come on, I'll get you a little suit,",S02E05,80
we'll get Jo a lovely corsage.,S02E05,81
"Trust me, you'll love it.",S02E05,82
Ever notice the things you say I'm gonna love,S02E05,83
I never love?,S02E05,84
Yeah.,S02E05,85
Gabe's looking forward to it.,S02E05,86
"See you tonight, stupid.",S02E05,87
Not that she needs any social graces.,S02E05,88
So I don't have a say in this?,S02E05,89
You're just gonna force me to go?,S02E05,90
"Oh, sweetie, that's part of the fun of being a parent.",S02E05,91
"Besides, I want at least one of my kids to have manners.",S02E05,92
"Mom, we're out of buns.",S02E05,93
"Oh yeah, you're going.",S02E05,94
"Okay, try this one.",S02E05,95
Open up.,S02E05,96
Okay.,S02E05,97
"Crunchy,",S02E05,98
And smooth.,S02E05,99
It's a corn chip with a scoop of peanut butter.,S02E05,100
I call it a corn butt.,S02E05,101
It's good.,S02E05,102
Needs a new name.,S02E05,103
Hey.,S02E05,104
What are you guys doing?,S02E05,105
Testing snacks for the party.,S02E05,106
Care for a Butt chip?,S02E05,107
How about I handle the snacks?,S02E05,108
"Oh, um, Teddy?",S02E05,109
-Looking forward to the party? -Mm-hmm.,S02E05,110
May I have the first dance?,S02E05,111
You have butt chip breath.,S02E05,112
I'll go brush.,S02E05,113
I was being insulted and you should have defended me!,S02E05,114
I couldn't too busy being embarrassed by you.,S02E05,115
What's going on?,S02E05,116
Ask the woman who just got kicked out of the grocery store.,S02E05,117
I was standing in the 15-items-or-less line.,S02E05,118
-Just minding my own business -With 17 items.,S02E05,119
 When this crazy woman in line behind us.,S02E05,120
Starts screaming at me to get out of line.,S02E05,121
Your mother handled it well though.,S02E05,122
"Grabbed the pricing gun, scanned the woman's face.",S02E05,123
And through this entire ugly confrontation.,S02E05,124
"Your father stood there, like an oaf, eating a donut.",S02E05,125
I was trying to get us down to 15 items.,S02E05,126
P.,S02E05,127
J.,S02E05,128
", tell your father.",S02E05,129
That I will not be speaking to him.,S02E05,130
Until he apologizes for not backing me up.,S02E05,131
"Okay. Teddy, tell your mother",S02E05,132
I will not apologize.,S02E05,133
And that I will not be speaking to her,S02E05,134
Until she apologizes for embarrassing me.,S02E05,135
"Whoa, glad I didn't get that one.",S02E05,136
Good evening and welcome to cotillion.,S02E05,137
I am Mr.,S02E05,138
Krump.,S02E05,139
And I am Mrs.,S02E05,140
Krump.,S02E05,141
And I am planning revenge on my mother.,S02E05,142
"How are you this evening, Mr. Krump?",S02E05,143
"Very well, thank you.",S02E05,144
"And you, Mrs.",S02E05,145
Krump?.,S02E05,146
"Oh, very well, Mr.",S02E05,147
Krump.,S02E05,148
Thank you.,S02E05,149
I have never hated two people so fast before.,S02E05,150
Now we'll be learning the art.,S02E05,151
Of complimenting one's dinner partner.,S02E05,152
"You look very lovely this evening, Mrs.",S02E05,153
Krump.,S02E05,154
"And you look most handsome, Mr.",S02E05,155
Krump.,S02E05,156
"Now, children, your turn.",S02E05,157
Compliment your partners.,S02E05,158
"Good evening, miss keener.",S02E05,159
Your eyes are as blue as the vein on Mrs.,S02E05,160
Krump's leg.,S02E05,161
"Why, thank you, Mr.",S02E05,162
Duncan.,S02E05,163
And may I say your cast is as green.,S02E05,164
As the booger peeking out of Mr. Krump's nose?,S02E05,165
"Now, gentlemen, escort your ladies.",S02E05,166
To a table and take your seats.,S02E05,167
"Now when dining, it is most important.",S02E05,168
To use the proper utensils.,S02E05,169
So pick up your smallest spoon.,S02E05,170
And enjoy some melon balls.,S02E05,171
"Here, miss keener, enjoy this.",S02E05,172
"Exeellent technique, Mr.",S02E05,173
Duncan.,S02E05,174
But if you use your soup spoon.,S02E05,175
You can have twice the enjoyment.,S02E05,176
Oh!,S02E05,177
I believe I'll give that a try.,S02E05,178
Oh ho ho! Oh ho ho.,S02E05,179
"All right, all right.",S02E05,180
Who did that?,S02E05,181
"Oh, what are you doing?",S02E05,182
"Well, since I'm no longer talking to your mother,",S02E05,183
I figured I'd sleep down here tonight.,S02E05,184
"-Oh, I'm sorry.",S02E05,185
-I'll be all right.,S02E05,186
I'm talking to the couch.,S02E05,187
"Next time you need your car insurance paid,",S02E05,188
Talk to the couch.,S02E05,189
"Uh, so, dad,",S02E05,190
Are you and mom still planning on going.,S02E05,191
To that hotel tomorrow night?,S02E05,192
Not unless she apologizes.,S02E05,193
She will be doing nothing of the sort.,S02E05,194
-I thought you weren't talking to me.,S02E05,195
-I wasn't.,S02E05,196
-You just did.,S02E05,197
-So did you.,S02E05,198
"Well, this is nice.",S02E05,199
You've got a dialogue going.,S02E05,200
-Oaf.,S02E05,201
-Lunatic.,S02E05,202
"Oh, P.",S02E05,203
J.,S02E05,204
", is is bad.",S02E05,205
If they don't go to the hotel tomorrow night,S02E05,206
then we can't have our party.,S02E05,207
-Unless -Unless what?,S02E05,208
-Unless they -Unless they what?,S02E05,209
I got the ball rolling here.,S02E05,210
I can't think of everything.,S02E05,211
Step and turn and dip.,S02E05,212
And done.,S02E05,213
Now let's have a couple of students on the floor.,S02E05,214
To demonstrate the position.,S02E05,215
How about.,S02E05,216
The melon launchers?,S02E05,217
Now the gentleman or in this case.,S02E05,218
You,S02E05,219
Holds his left hand thusly.,S02E05,220
And his right hand.,S02E05,221
Around the lady's waist.,S02E05,222
"All right, now move in a little closer.",S02E05,223
She's not going to bite.,S02E05,224
"Yes, but she will punch and kick.",S02E05,225
It's true.,S02E05,226
I do that.,S02E05,227
Move a little closer.,S02E05,228
Closer! There you go.,S02E05,229
"All right, gentlemen, please address your partners.",S02E05,230
This is weird.,S02E05,231
-It's not so weird. -You like it?,S02E05,232
"Yeah, kinda.",S02E05,233
Ew! You like it.,S02E05,234
-So? -So it's gross.,S02E05,235
I don't want to be your boyfriend.,S02E05,236
-I don't want to be your girlfriend. -Good!,S02E05,237
-Good! -I'm outta here.,S02E05,238
Fine!,S02E05,239
Don't worry.,S02E05,240
He'll be back.,S02E05,241
They always come back.,S02E05,242
And regret it for the rest of their lives.,S02E05,243
"Look, dad,",S02E05,244
-I know you're right.,S02E05,245
-And I know you're right.,S02E05,246
But at the end of the day would you rather be right,S02E05,247
Or would you rather be happy?,S02E05,248
-Well -Happy.,S02E05,249
The answer's happy.,S02E05,250
All you have to do is just apologize to mom.,S02E05,251
"And if you can't do it for yourself,",S02E05,252
Do it for the kids.,S02E05,253
"All right, maybe you're right.",S02E05,254
"Attaboy, dad.",S02E05,255
Yeah yeah yeah.,S02E05,256
"And besides, you should be used to apologizing to mom by now.",S02E05,257
You've done it like 100 times.,S02E05,258
"I have, haven't I?",S02E05,259
"That makes the score mom 100, dad nothing.",S02E05,260
"Dad, I said like 100 to nothing.",S02E05,261
"Maybe it's 200 to nothing, we don't know.",S02E05,262
"Don't listen to him, just go go go!",S02E05,263
For the kids.,S02E05,264
I'm not apologizing.,S02E05,265
I'm right.,S02E05,266
And you know what? After today.,S02E05,267
"The score is going to be mom 100,",S02E05,268
Dad 1.,S02E05,269
-What just happened here? -You blew it.,S02E05,270
You started using numbers.,S02E05,271
Stupid math.,S02E05,272
Now we're gonna have to cancel the party.,S02E05,273
"No, we can't do that.",S02E05,274
It's too late.,S02E05,275
I'll just have to talk to mom and get her to apologize.,S02E05,276
"It won't be easy, but I can do it.",S02E05,277
-Fortunately we have a special bond.,S02E05,278
-Mmm.,S02E05,279
-Mom -I'm not apologizing.,S02E05,280
Good night.,S02E05,281
"Okay, P.",S02E05,282
J.,S02E05,283
", try one more time.",S02E05,284
"-Okay, Charlie, what's the matter? -I'm sad.",S02E05,285
"Why are you sad, Charlie?",S02E05,286
Mommy and daddy fight.,S02E05,287
"Yes, good job, Charlie.",S02E05,288
Just try not to say it with a smile.,S02E05,289
You're sad.,S02E05,290
Let us feel your pain.,S02E05,291
-She's two. -So she can't give us a good performance?,S02E05,292
"All right, Charlie,",S02E05,293
work your magic so we can have our party.,S02E05,294
-All right.,S02E05,295
-Okay.,S02E05,296
-Come on.,S02E05,297
-Okay.,S02E05,298
"Mom, dad, get in here.",S02E05,299
-What's going on? -Everything okay?,S02E05,300
Charlie seems very upset.,S02E05,301
"Charlie, tell mommy and daddy what's the matter.",S02E05,302
Party.,S02E05,303
Party!,S02E05,304
Why does she keep saying party?,S02E05,305
Just stop focusing on what she just said.,S02E05,306
"Focus on what she said before,",S02E05,307
Which was I sad.,S02E05,308
Mommy and daddy fight.,S02E05,309
"Yeah, and then she said, I just wish they'd make up.",S02E05,310
And go to the romantic suite at the hotel.,S02E05,311
-You said all that? -Party!,S02E05,312
"Hi, welcome to the party.",S02E05,313
Little change of plans.,S02E05,314
You want to go around the house.,S02E05,315
To that window over there and climb in through the basement.,S02E05,316
My mom and dad are home.,S02E05,317
So this is going to be a quiet party.,S02E05,318
We're not gonna make any noise.,S02E05,319
Now go have fun.,S02E05,320
"Hi, little change of plans.",S02E05,321
Amy?,S02E05,322
"Yes, Bob?",S02E05,323
Where's the couch?,S02E05,324
"Oh, that old thing you've been sleeping on?",S02E05,325
I sent it out to be cleaned.,S02E05,326
"You know, usually when they clean a couch,",S02E05,327
They clean it when it's still in the home.,S02E05,328
"Well, couch cleaners-to-go takes it to go.",S02E05,329
I guess they have some sort of special process.,S02E05,330
"Very well,",S02E05,331
I guess I'll be sleeping on the couch in the basement then.,S02E05,332
"Yeah, I don't think so.",S02E05,333
They were having a two-for-one special.,S02E05,334
You think you're so smart.,S02E05,335
There's an air mattress in the garage.,S02E05,336
Popped it!,S02E05,337
"Hey! Hey, party animals.",S02E05,338
"Here's a pen and paper, chat amongst yourselves.",S02E05,339
Okay.,S02E05,340
What?!,S02E05,341
What did I say?! Vibrate only!,S02E05,342
"Emmett! Emmett, take the change out of your pockets.",S02E05,343
"Oh, right.",S02E05,344
Oh!,S02E05,345
Dad's coming!,S02E05,346
Everybody into my room.,S02E05,347
Go go go.,S02E05,348
Go go go!,S02E05,349
Ahhh!,S02E05,350
Everything okay down here?,S02E05,351
"Yeah, we're fine.",S02E05,352
"I mean, yeah, we're fine.",S02E05,353
-I thought I heard noises.,S02E05,354
-No no.,S02E05,355
No.,S02E05,356
"No noises down here, dad.",S02E05,357
Just down to the brother and sister getting along.,S02E05,358
Ow.,S02E05,359
"Hey, hon what?",S02E05,360
Why aren't you dressed for cotillion?,S02E05,361
I'm not going.,S02E05,362
Jo and I had a fight.,S02E05,363
-What happened? -They made us dance really close.,S02E05,364
And she liked it! It was gross.,S02E05,365
"Well, one day you'll feel different.",S02E05,366
Then 20 years will go by.,S02E05,367
And it will be gross all over again.,S02E05,368
"Gabe, Jo's here.",S02E05,369
"-Gabe! -I'm sorry, what?",S02E05,370
"I said give me my stupid flower, stupid.",S02E05,371
Wow.,S02E05,372
"Not so gross now, huh?",S02E05,373
Just wait.,S02E05,374
"Is there anything I can get you, miss keener?",S02E05,375
I mean besides a refund which I can't get you.,S02E05,376
I'm just here to pass the class.,S02E05,377
"Good evening, miss keener.",S02E05,378
"What are you doing here, stupid?",S02E05,379
May I have this dance?,S02E05,380
Thanks.,S02E05,381
That was,S02E05,382
Okay.,S02E05,383
"Dinner, everyone, dinner.",S02E05,384
-I have a surprise for you. -Really? What is it?,S02E05,385
I put some earthworms into Mrs.,S02E05,386
Krump's salad.,S02E05,387
And she should be finding them right about,S02E05,388
Now.,S02E05,389
"Oh, miss keener, you are a delight.",S02E05,390
Bob! Where is he?,S02E05,391
What? For heaven's sakes.,S02E05,392
What are you doing?,S02E05,393
"Fine. I'm sorry, okay?",S02E05,394
What's that?,S02E05,395
I didn't hear you.,S02E05,396
Don't make me say it again.,S02E05,397
"No no no, I mean I really didn't hear you.",S02E05,398
I think my ears froze.,S02E05,399
I'm sorry.,S02E05,400
I was wrong.,S02E05,401
And I behaved badly in the grocery store.,S02E05,402
And I shouldn't have embarrassed you.,S02E05,403
"Man, this is hard.",S02E05,404
I don't know how you've done it 162 times.,S02E05,405
It's because I love you.,S02E05,406
"Mmm, I love you.",S02E05,407
Come here.,S02E05,408
You know there's a secret party going on downstairs?,S02E05,409
"Yeah, of course I do.",S02E05,410
You know we're gonna have to punish them?,S02E05,411
I'm way ahead of you.,S02E05,412
"Mom, dad, we get it.",S02E05,413
"Okay, we're sorry.",S02E05,414
We'll never do it again.,S02E05,415
-Haven't we been punished enough? -Sprinkler?,S02E05,416
"Oh, sprinkler, yes, definitely.",S02E05,417
"-Whoosh, whoosh -No!",S02E05,418
"Hi, Charlie.",S02E05,419
So finally tried doing something bad.,S02E05,420
It didn't turn out so good.,S02E05,421
I got punished.,S02E05,422
-Running man. -Running man?,S02E05,423
"Yep, and I'm still being punished.",S02E05,424
"So always try and be a good girl, because if not",S02E05,425
Gooseneck!,S02E05,426
"Yeah, good luck, Charlie.",S02E05,427
"So elegant, so poised.",S02E05,428
Such sophistication.,S02E05,429
"Our finest pupil ever, Mrs.",S02E05,430
Krump.,S02E05,431
Uh-oh.,S02E05,432
"She's the last of the Duncan kids, right, Mrs. Krump?",S02E05,433
"One can only hope, Mr.",S02E05,434
Krump.,S02E05,435
"-Thanks for the ride home, Evan.",S02E06,0
-Sure.,S02E06,1
You didn't mind sitting through my practice?,S02E06,2
"Oh, no no no, not at all.",S02E06,3
You look cute in your uniform.,S02E06,4
-I'm on the swim team.,S02E06,5
-Yeah.,S02E06,6
-Hey.,S02E06,7
"-Oh, uh, Evan, this is my brother Gabe.",S02E06,8
"-Gabe, this is Evan.",S02E06,9
- Wait a minute.,S02E06,10
-Don't I know you from somewhere? -I don't think so.,S02E06,11
I've definitely seen you before.,S02E06,12
"Hey, why don't you go check your room?",S02E06,13
Lots of really good clues there.,S02E06,14
-I should get going.,S02E06,15
See you tomorrow? -Bye.,S02E06,16
Yeah.,S02E06,17
Oh god.,S02E06,18
Thanks a lot.,S02E06,19
What did I do?,S02E06,20
He's been driving me home every day for the past two weeks.,S02E06,21
I think he was finally going to ask me out,S02E06,22
Until you scared him off with all your talking,S02E06,23
And pointing and,S02E06,24
"I'm sorry, but he looks familiar.",S02E06,25
Was he my camp counselor?,S02E06,26
"No no no, he seemed afraid of me,",S02E06,27
But not that afraid of me.,S02E06,28
Why would a totally hot guy like Evan know you?,S02E06,29
What's wrong with me? Slegowart!,S02E06,30
You say things like slegowart.,S02E06,31
"No no, slegowart is a character in pokeo.",S02E06,32
That's how I know evan-- from the game store.,S02E06,33
Evan plays pokeo?,S02E06,34
That nerdy card game with those stupid cartoon creatures?,S02E06,35
No.,S02E06,36
"Evan plays pokeo, the fantasy card game",S02E06,37
That requires a keen level of skill and strategy.,S02E06,38
But why would Evan play that? That's for little kids.,S02E06,39
Wigimon is for little kids.,S02E06,40
Pokeo is for nine and up.,S02E06,41
How is that possible?,S02E06,42
Now the cute hot guy is a secret nerd?,S02E06,43
"Well, many of us in the world of fantasy card games",S02E06,44
Are considered quite attractive.,S02E06,45
Today's all burnt toast ,S02E06,46
"Running late, and dad jokes",S02E06,47
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S02E06,48
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S02E06,49
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S02E06,50
There it is up on the roof,S02E06,51
"I've been there, I've survived",S02E06,52
So just take my advice,S02E06,53
"Hang in there, baby",S02E06,54
Things are crazy,S02E06,55
But I know your future's bright,S02E06,56
"Hang in there, baby",S02E06,57
There's no maybe,S02E06,58
Everything turns out all right,S02E06,59
Your life is up and down,S02E06,60
But trust me it comes back around,S02E06,61
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S02E06,62
"Hang in there, baby.",S02E06,63
"-Mom's home! -Hey, honey!",S02E06,64
"Hey, the banquet's tonight. Did you rent me a tux?",S02E06,65
-It's right over there.,S02E06,66
-Okay.,S02E06,67
Did you get me the one that makes me look like james bond?,S02E06,68
"Yeah, honey, I got you the magic tux.",S02E06,69
"Mom, did you type my report?",S02E06,70
"You know, because of my broken finger?",S02E06,71
"-Yes, I typed your report. -What's it about?",S02E06,72
-The civil war. -What's my take?,S02E06,73
"-Why don't you read it? -No, that's the teacher's job.",S02E06,74
"Mom, I'm hungry. Is there anything to eat?",S02E06,75
What's that thing filled with food right next to you?,S02E06,76
Dad?,S02E06,77
"Hey, mom, could you help out",S02E06,78
With my school car wash on Saturday morning?,S02E06,79
"Honey, that's my only day off work.",S02E06,80
Perfect.,S02E06,81
So you're free.,S02E06,82
"All right, bring your own chamois.",S02E06,83
"Okay okay, stop.",S02E06,84
"I need five minutes of peace, please.",S02E06,85
That is a wonderful idea.,S02E06,86
You just sit there and relax.,S02E06,87
Thank you.,S02E06,88
"-I'm not seeing the bow tie-- -oh my-- okay, come on.",S02E06,89
"Let's go, charlie.",S02E06,90
You're the only one who isn't annoying me right now.,S02E06,91
There's no cover page.,S02E06,92
Where's my nose?,S02E06,93
That's my nose.,S02E06,94
That's great.,S02E06,95
What else do you know? Where's my ear?,S02E06,96
That's my ear.,S02E06,97
Where's my eye?,S02E06,98
Ow!  Ow.,S02E06,99
Oh my gosh.,S02E06,100
"-Wow, she got me.",S02E06,101
Ow.,S02E06,102
-What?.,S02E06,103
"Ow, Charlie poked me in the eye.",S02E06,104
"Oh, I can't open my eye.",S02E06,105
"Bob, it really hurts.",S02E06,106
"Mom, maybe you should get it checked out.",S02E06,107
"Teddy, I'm a nurse.",S02E06,108
I don't need you to tell me,S02E06,109
When I need to get something checked out.,S02E06,110
"Bob, I need to get this checked out.",S02E06,111
"Well, Amy, it doesn't look like your cornea is scratched.",S02E06,112
I'm going to prescribe some drops.,S02E06,113
Wear this eyepatch overnight and you'll be good to go.,S02E06,114
"You mean go, as in go home?",S02E06,115
"Well, that's good news, isn't it?",S02E06,116
"Well, home is where the cooking and cleaning",S02E06,117
And laundry and homework and husband and kids and--,S02E06,118
I don't wanna go home.,S02E06,119
But there's nothing wrong with you.,S02E06,120
"Well, with your eye.",S02E06,121
Can't you just keep me overnight for observation?,S02E06,122
"Amy, as a nurse you know that's not appropriate.",S02E06,123
This is not a hotel.,S02E06,124
"You know what else isn't appropriate, dr. Meyers?",S02E06,125
Telling people you're working at the free clinic,S02E06,126
When you're really playing 18 holes,S02E06,127
At the denver country club.,S02E06,128
I think you'll enjoy room 207.,S02E06,129
Where's mom?,S02E06,130
"Oh no, she didn't make it, did she?",S02E06,131
Your mom is going to be fine.,S02E06,132
"No, I'm talking about the meatloaf.",S02E06,133
"She didn't make it, did she?",S02E06,134
"You know, the concern you have for the woman",S02E06,135
Who gave birth to you is overwhelming.,S02E06,136
She was going to wrap it in bacon.,S02E06,137
Really?,S02E06,138
Wait a minute. What am I thinking about?,S02E06,139
I've got my banquet tonight.,S02E06,140
"Hey, you wanna come with?",S02E06,141
Denver pest control association puts on quite a do.,S02E06,142
-I don't know. -Why not?,S02E06,143
Because I had trouble staying awake during that sentence.,S02E06,144
Are you telling me you don't wanna see your old man,S02E06,145
Win the exterminator of the year award?,S02E06,146
"Oh right, that award you think you're going to win every year,",S02E06,147
But you don't because Murray always does.,S02E06,148
"Look, there is no way that the same guy",S02E06,149
-Can win every year. -Why not?,S02E06,150
The same guy loses every year.,S02E06,151
"All right, you know what? Enough about murray.",S02E06,152
Do you wanna see your father win the award or not?,S02E06,153
Murray's my dad?,S02E06,154
Mom?,S02E06,155
Oh my--,S02E06,156
How are you feeling?,S02E06,157
"-Oh, a little better. -Yeah?",S02E06,158
But I miss you and charlie and,S02E06,159
The others.,S02E06,160
I'm glad one of us is doing well.,S02E06,161
That's nice.,S02E06,162
Thank you for coming.,S02E06,163
"Mom, I just got here.",S02E06,164
Oh right.,S02E06,165
Ha.,S02E06,166
"Well, how are you?.",S02E06,167
"Well, actually there's this boy Evan",S02E06,168
"That I really like, but, um",S02E06,169
I found out something kind of disturbing about him.,S02E06,170
He's into pokeo.,S02E06,171
Pokeo?  That thing Gabe likes?,S02E06,172
"Well, honey, what would you see in a guy like that?",S02E06,173
"Well, this is Evan at a swim meet.",S02E06,174
"Yeah, that explains that.",S02E06,175
"Well, honey, no one's perfect.",S02E06,176
Everyone has their flaws.,S02E06,177
You think I was thrilled when I found out your father was into bugs?,S02E06,178
But you got over it?,S02E06,179
"Yeah, that's what I did-- got over it.",S02E06,180
"Look, honey, relationships are about compromise.",S02E06,181
"If you really like this guy,",S02E06,182
Try being interested in things he's interested in.,S02E06,183
On my second date with your father,S02E06,184
I threw out three facts about bark beetles.,S02E06,185
"Ha ha, the man was mine.",S02E06,186
"Well, I've taken up enough of your time.",S02E06,187
"Mom, didn't you get poked in the other eye?",S02E06,188
"No no, it was-- it was this eye.",S02E06,189
I'm pretty sure it was the other one.,S02E06,190
No no no no.,S02E06,191
"Oh gosh, let mama rest, dear.",S02E06,192
Let mama rest.,S02E06,193
"Okay, let's do this one more time.",S02E06,194
I'm putting down my dragony card.,S02E06,195
What's your counterattack?,S02E06,196
Um,S02E06,197
-Weepok? -Weepok?,S02E06,198
You played a weepok when you could have played a scalamaster?,S02E06,199
Scalamaster-- that's-- that's the octopus dude,S02E06,200
With the suction cup thingies?,S02E06,201
Vortexes.,S02E06,202
They're called vortexes.,S02E06,203
You know what? I can't work with you.,S02E06,204
You have no respect for the mythical world of dort.,S02E06,205
Oh no.,S02E06,206
"Gabe, please, just give me one more chance.",S02E06,207
Forget it.,S02E06,208
Forget it.,S02E06,209
-This is hopeless.,S02E06,210
-You're right.,S02E06,211
I feel like Gasio going up against Misrod.,S02E06,212
Wait a minute.,S02E06,213
That wasn't wrong.,S02E06,214
-It wasn't? -No no.,S02E06,215
Gasio would have no chance against misrod because?,S02E06,216
Because grass power is no match for volcano power?,S02E06,217
Yes yes yes!,S02E06,218
"Wow, teachers really do make a difference.",S02E06,219
Honey?,S02E06,220
Honey?  Hey.,S02E06,221
"How are you feeling, sweetie?",S02E06,222
I've been better.,S02E06,223
"Well, I got something that's going to help cheer you up.",S02E06,224
Tada!,S02E06,225
Exterminator of the year!,S02E06,226
You won? That is fantastic!,S02E06,227
"Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you!",S02E06,228
I gave a great big speech and everything.,S02E06,229
"-Aw, did you say something nice about me? -Of course I did.",S02E06,230
P.,S02E06,231
J.,S02E06,232
", he got the whole thing recorded on his phone.",S02E06,233
-Show her the speech.,S02E06,234
"-Yeah, let me see it.",S02E06,235
"Dad, can I speak to you outside for a second?",S02E06,236
- What? - Yeah.,S02E06,237
- What the heck are you doing? - Go go go.,S02E06,238
- You can't show mom that video. - Why not?,S02E06,239
- Because you don't thank her.,S02E06,240
"- Oh, that's ridiculous.",S02E06,241
- You don't even mention her.,S02E06,242
- Of course I did.,S02E06,243
Let's take a look.,S02E06,244
"Okay.  Oh, man, where do I start?",S02E06,245
"Oh yeah, in your face, Murray!",S02E06,246
Huh?,S02E06,247

I want to thank my kids p.,S02E06,250
J.,S02E06,251

Who make me want to work so hard every day.,S02E06,253
"Oh, and how about a shout-out to all the bugs out there, huh?",S02E06,254
Without whom none of us would be here.,S02E06,255
Most importantly I want to thank,S02E06,256
One very special lady tonight--,S02E06,257
My waitress! Iris!,S02E06,258
"Keep em comin', baby!",S02E06,259
I'm a winner!,S02E06,260
"Wow, that's not good.",S02E06,261
Oh man.,S02E06,262
What am I gonna do?,S02E06,263
- You could tell mom the truth. - Or?,S02E06,264
I could tell mom the truth?,S02E06,265
Or?,S02E06,266
We could sneak out of here and think of something later?,S02E06,267
Ding ding ding ding.,S02E06,268
Thanks again for giving me a ride.,S02E06,269
Thanks again for waiting till my swim practice was over.,S02E06,270
Thank me? Thank you.,S02E06,271
"- Same time tomorrow? - Yeah, sounds good.",S02E06,272
"- All right. - Hey, could you do me a favor",S02E06,273
And grab my keys out of my backpack?,S02E06,274
Sure.,S02E06,275
You have pokeo cards?,S02E06,276
"Oh no, you weren't supposed to see those.",S02E06,277
I'm so embarrassed.,S02E06,278
Don't be.,S02E06,279
I'm into pokeo too.,S02E06,280
"Wait, what?",S02E06,281
I didn't want to say anything because,S02E06,282
I was afraid you'd think I was weird.,S02E06,283
"Wait, yeah, that's why I didn't want to say anything to you.",S02E06,284
My dream is to become a level-four card master,S02E06,285
And earn my gorgonic shield.,S02E06,286
That's my dream.,S02E06,287
"Wait, what?",S02E06,288
Will you go out with me?,S02E06,289
Does scalamaster have vortexes?,S02E06,290
Yeah.,S02E06,291
Are you sure this is going to work?,S02E06,292
"Trust me, it's going to look exactly like your real acceptance speech.",S02E06,293
But you might want to move charlie.,S02E06,294
Huh?  Oh okay.,S02E06,295
"Come here, sweetie.",S02E06,296
Come on.,S02E06,297

Okay.,S02E06,314
"All right, action.",S02E06,315
Thank you for this award.,S02E06,316
This is one of the great moments of my life.,S02E06,317
Cut.,S02E06,318
I gotta take this.,S02E06,319
Hello?,S02E06,320
"Oh no, I'm not doing anything.",S02E06,321
What's going on?,S02E06,322
Sorry I had to bring charlie on our first date.,S02E06,323
I kind of thought my mom would be out of the hospital by now.,S02E06,324
Actually I'm excited you brought her.,S02E06,325
She's going to make this even better.,S02E06,326
"Yeah, what is this anyway? What are we doing?",S02E06,327
- We're going to larp. - Larp?,S02E06,328
larp stands for live action role-play.,S02E06,329
"Anyone can play pokeo with cards,",S02E06,330
"But when you put on the costumes and you act it out,",S02E06,331
It takes it to a whole new level.,S02E06,332
"Oh, you're joking, right?",S02E06,333
"Oh, you're not joking.",S02E06,334
"Guys, this is teddy and charlie.",S02E06,335
"Teddy and Charlie, this is Slugmar,",S02E06,336
"Weepok, Scalamaster, and Gulagon.",S02E06,337
You brought girls.,S02E06,338
We've never had girls.,S02E06,339
Okay.,S02E06,340
"Well, since we're not really dressed",S02E06,341
"For the whole larping thing,",S02E06,342
Charlie and I are just going to go sit over here while you guys play.,S02E06,343
"Oh, no no no, don't worry.",S02E06,344
I thought of everything.,S02E06,345
And the best part is we're out in public.,S02E06,346
"Oh, bad news, mom.",S02E06,347
You got a b- on my civil war report.,S02E06,348
Not your best work.,S02E06,349
I'll try harder next time.,S02E06,350
"So, honey, ready to see my big speech?",S02E06,351
That I shot with my phone,S02E06,352
At the hotel,S02E06,353
The other night.,S02E06,354
Just hit play.,S02E06,355
"thank you, thank you, thank you.",S02E06,356
"Thank you, denver pest control association.",S02E06,357
Not a very nice hotel this year.,S02E06,358
"Uh, it's budget cuts.",S02E06,359
"You know, winning an award like this is incredible,",S02E06,360
But I'm already a winner,S02E06,361
Because of my wonderful wife amy.,S02E06,362
When I think about this amazing woman,S02E06,363
I get all emotional.,S02E06,364
"Wait, what is that?",S02E06,365
P.,S02E06,366
J.,S02E06,367
", rewind.",S02E06,368
"There, pause.",S02E06,369
"- Bob, what's going on? - All right, look",S02E06,370
"Honey, the truth is in all the excitement of that night",S02E06,371
With the award and the lights--,S02E06,372
I don't know.,S02E06,373
I just-- I forgot to thank you.,S02E06,374
And then we made the tape to cover up the lie,S02E06,375
And I just-- I'm really really sorry.,S02E06,376
"Look, bob, I really-- I appreciate the effort,",S02E06,377
But why did you have to lie to me?,S02E06,378
"I mean if we don't have honesty,",S02E06,379
What do we have here?,S02E06,380
What do we have here?,S02E06,381
"Mom, according to your chart,",S02E06,382
It says there's nothing wrong with your eye,S02E06,383
And you should have gone home yesterday.,S02E06,384
"Hey, you wanna pretend the last minute of our lives never happened?",S02E06,385
What last minute?,S02E06,386
Our two peoples have been in conflict for many years.,S02E06,387
Mm.,S02E06,388
Today the final battle begins.,S02E06,389
"Chicapu is supposed to say, assume the positions",S02E06,390
And prepare for the gorgonic war.,S02E06,391
"-Charlie, say go. -Go!",S02E06,392
Chicapu has spoken. Let the battle commence!,S02E06,393
"Wardart, come quick!",S02E06,394
"Ha!  Feel my wrath, you knaves!",S02E06,395
Never! Vengeance will be mine in the name of gorgon.,S02E06,396
"Hey, Evan, Evan, what am I supposed to do?",S02E06,397

"Chicapu, you're a worthy adversary indeed.",S02E06,407
"Quick, wardart, throw your fireball.",S02E06,408
"No, not at me. No, not--",S02E06,409
"Ha ha, dead! You are dead.",S02E06,410
What is wrong with you?,S02E06,411
"Well, you told me to throw it.",S02E06,412
Not at me.,S02E06,413
I'm out of the game now.,S02E06,414
"Well, can't you just call backsies or something?",S02E06,415
"Backsies? What are you, five?",S02E06,416
"Oh, I'm five?",S02E06,417
You're the one running around the park,S02E06,418
Dressed like a giant frog.,S02E06,419
I am a magic toad.,S02E06,420
"Yes yes, you are,",S02E06,421
Which means I must now leave,S02E06,422
"The mythical land of nerdingham,",S02E06,423
For I have lost interest,S02E06,424
No matter how good thou looketh in a swimsuit.,S02E06,425
"Chicapu, away!",S02E06,426
"Come here, you.",S02E06,427
Okay.,S02E06,428
So you brought that girl here on a date?,S02E06,429
Yeah.,S02E06,430
So it's almost as if I were on a date.,S02E06,431
"Hey, charlie.",S02E06,432
"Listen, when you get to be my age,",S02E06,433
Don't pretend to be someone you're not just to impress a guy.,S02E06,434
I just learned that.,S02E06,435
I also learned that if you walk home from the park,S02E06,436
"Dressed like a giant chicken,",S02E06,437
You're going to be chased by a dog.,S02E06,438
"Hey, did you touch my pokeo cards?",S02E06,439
-No. -Liar!,S02E06,440
There's a bent corner on my slugmar card.,S02E06,441
Mom!,S02E06,442

"If you fall for a guy with something in common with gabe,",S02E06,444
"Good luck, charlie.",S02E06,445

It would be my pleasure.,S02E06,452
"Well, Bob, as you know",S02E06,453
I've been spending a lot of time with Teddy,S02E06,454
And things are going very well.,S02E06,455
And Amy and I are absolutely thrilled about that.,S02E06,456
"My future is bright, sir.",S02E06,457
I have a good part-time job at the comic book store.,S02E06,458
-I own my own bike.,S02E06,459
-I think I know where this is headed.,S02E06,460
I guess what I'm trying to say is,S02E06,461
I'd like your permission to ask Teddy,S02E06,462
To be my g-girlfriend.,S02E06,463
"Welcome to the family, son.",S02E06,464
Reality!,S02E06,465
"Well, thank you for the larp, mr.",S02E06,466
Duncan.,S02E06,467
"Just go wash the car, lewis.",S02E06,468
"Yes, sir.",S02E06,469
"-Hey, honey.",S02E07,0
-Hi.,S02E07,1
"-What you got there? -Oh, it's a wonderful painting",S02E07,2
"by an up-and-coming artist named,",S02E07,3

That's right.,S02E07,5
"Hey, you had your first art class tonight.",S02E07,6
"-How'd that go? -I don't know, you tell me.",S02E07,7
Ba-bam.,S02E07,8
-What is it? -It's obvious.,S02E07,9
"Oh! Oh, I know.",S02E07,10
It's three eggs in a nest.,S02E07,11
"No, wait.",S02E07,12
"No, it's a baked potato with three pats of butter.",S02E07,13
"Dad, you see that in every painting.",S02E07,14
"Oh, I think it's baby chicks eating out of a football.",S02E07,15
"Lemons, okay?",S02E07,16
It's a bowl of lemons.,S02E07,17
Oh.,S02E07,18
You people have no appreciation for art.,S02E07,19
"Oh, come on, honey.",S02E07,20
Honey.,S02E07,21
"-What? -Come on, you know what they say",S02E07,22
If life gives you a bowl of lemons,S02E07,23
That's not very well painted,S02E07,24
Then you should make make dinner?,S02E07,25
"Good save, dad.",S02E07,26
Today's all burnt toast ,S02E07,27
"Running late, and dad jokes",S02E07,28
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S02E07,29
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S02E07,30
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S02E07,31
There it is up on the roof,S02E07,32
"I've been there, I've survived",S02E07,33
So just take my advice,S02E07,34
"Hang in there, baby",S02E07,35
Things are crazy,S02E07,36
But I know your future's bright,S02E07,37
"Hang in there, baby",S02E07,38
There's no maybe,S02E07,39
Everything turns out all right,S02E07,40
Your life is up and down,S02E07,41
But trust me it comes back around,S02E07,42
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S02E07,43
"Hang in there, baby.",S02E07,44
"-Hey, guys. -What are you doing here?",S02E07,45
Did you come to see me sign up for the battle of the bands?,S02E07,46
Or maybe Teddy bear is here to see me.,S02E07,47
"Okay, so the topic is",S02E07,48
insane reasons why Teddy's at the mall.,S02E07,49
"No no no, i'm here to sign up for battle of the bands.",S02E07,50
"-You have a band? -Yes, I do.",S02E07,51
My friend Skyler and I have been working on some music.,S02E07,52
Oh no Spencer.,S02E07,53
"Man, if he's in this thing, we are toast.",S02E07,54
"He's a complete package with the singing, the dancing and the sparkly smiling.",S02E07,55
Excuse me.,S02E07,56
"Hey, guys.",S02E07,57
-Hey.,S02E07,58
-Mm-hmm.,S02E07,59
So you're you're you have a band now?,S02E07,60
"-No, I'm gonna perform alone.",S02E07,61
-Huh.,S02E07,62
Because this is battle of the bands,S02E07,63
"and I'm pretty sure the word band implies group,",S02E07,64
I.,S02E07,65
E.,S02E07,66
", more than one.",S02E07,67
"I mean, I could be wrong,",S02E07,68
but I don't don't think so.,S02E07,69
"Actually, I called and they said I could perform alone",S02E07,70
Something about drawing a bigger crowd.,S02E07,71
"No, I don't know.",S02E07,72
"I should get back in line, so good luck.",S02E07,73
You know something? His teeth were not that sparkly.,S02E07,74
That's just what I was thinking.,S02E07,75
"Dude, we're gonna win this thing because we are so insane.",S02E07,76
-We're so insane.,S02E07,77
Fist bump.,S02E07,78

What you got there?,S02E07,89
A brand-new mytab.,S02E07,90
My best friend Lucas gave it to me.,S02E07,91
Lucas? Never heard of him. How long have you guys been best friends?,S02E07,92
Since 3:00 today when he gave me this mytab.,S02E07,93
Sounds like he's trying to buy your friendship.,S02E07,94
"Well, it worked.",S02E07,95
"Well, it's too expensive a gift.",S02E07,96
-You're gonna have to give it back. -What? Why?,S02E07,97
You shouldn't choose your friends because of the stuff they have.,S02E07,98
Now how would you like it if people only liked you,S02E07,99
because you had nice things?,S02E07,100
Why don't I keep this and we'll test your theory?,S02E07,101
"Gabe, if you won't give it back, I will.",S02E07,102
Fine.,S02E07,103
"Fine, dad.",S02E07,104
I don't need this thing.,S02E07,105
I have plenty of other great games to play with.,S02E07,106
Like this.,S02E07,107
You disgust me.,S02E07,108
Okay.,S02E07,109
-Shall we? -Shall we what?,S02E07,110
Rehearse the song.,S02E07,111

-Shall we? -Shall we what?,S02E07,115
"Oh! One, two,",S02E07,116
"one, two, three.",S02E07,117
I've been holding on,S02E07,118
Till I see your face,S02E07,119
Been there and gone,S02E07,120
And I own my mistakes,S02E07,121
Time stands still,S02E07,122

"Okay, only after I say stuff.",S02E07,145
Got it.,S02E07,146
"Skyler, let's go.",S02E07,147
We have a contest to win.,S02E07,148
"Yeah, well, so do we.",S02E07,149
I wanna know what you dream,S02E07,150
I wanna know what you wish,S02E07,151

"yours is just a bunch of squiggly lines, okay?",S02E07,169
"Okay, but you know what?",S02E07,170
We're gonna put it on the wall anyway.,S02E07,171
Put it right there.,S02E07,172
A tree.,S02E07,173
I don't think so.,S02E07,174
"Bob honey, could you clean up Charlie?",S02E07,175
I live for it.,S02E07,176
Val! Oh my goodness.,S02E07,177

And then I met you.,S02E07,187
What? You don't think I have talent?,S02E07,188
"Oh! Your words, not mine.",S02E07,189
"Although if I were to use words,",S02E07,190
I'd choose those.,S02E07,191
"Well, uh, give me another chance.",S02E07,192
What is that?! Oh!,S02E07,193
It's glorious!,S02E07,194
What passion! What vibrancy!,S02E07,195
"Oh, Amy, you paint with a joy",S02E07,196
that's almost childlike.,S02E07,197
"-Well, actually -It's genius!",S02E07,198
Thank you.,S02E07,199
This is what you should be focusing on,S02E07,200

"-Oh, that's too bad.",S02E07,220

"Albert, can I get",S02E07,250
a trayful of tacos and some root beer? Thanks.,S02E07,251
"You're kidding, right?",S02E07,252

-Oh.,S02E07,264
"Gabe, I thought it over,",S02E07,265
-and here. -Y-you're gonna let me keep it?,S02E07,266
Why'd you change your mind?,S02E07,267
Because I'm not an unreasonable man.,S02E07,268
"In fact, I'm so not unreasonable,",S02E07,269
I accepted one myself.,S02E07,270
"Not-not not that I'm complaining,",S02E07,271
but you're sending me some mixed messages here.,S02E07,272
I like to think of them as flexible messages.,S02E07,273
"You saw the den, didn't you?",S02E07,274
I had two trays of tacos.,S02E07,275
"And we're gonna have more this Sunday,",S02E07,276

"Come on, we have to get going. It's almost time for us to go",S02E07,291
"Actually, I don't want to do the contest anymore.",S02E07,292
"-What? Why not? -Well, because",S02E07,293
I don't want to compete against my boyfriend.,S02E07,294
Boyfriend? Who's your boyfriend?,S02E07,295

Wha so that's why you don't want to do battle of the bands?,S02E07,307
"-Because you're a couple? -That's right,",S02E07,308
'cause competing against each other would not be good for our relationship.,S02E07,309
-But what about our song? -You can sing it.,S02E07,310
-But it's a duet. -So?,S02E07,311
So I can't du-et without you.,S02E07,312

and now they don't want to do battle of the bands.,S02E07,319
What? After all our hard work?,S02E07,320
I even asked my mom to come.,S02E07,321
"Well, sorry to disappoint her.",S02E07,322
"Oh no, it's okay.",S02E07,323
She said no.,S02E07,324
Come on.,S02E07,325
"Come on, Charlie.",S02E07,326
-One painting for mama? -I tired.,S02E07,327

"Oh, well, I guess she just got her second wind.",S02E07,332
I tired.,S02E07,333
Don't know where that came from.,S02E07,334
All right.,S02E07,335
What's going on? Why are you acting crazier than usual?,S02E07,336
My art teacher came over to tell me that I stink.,S02E07,337
"Okay, I'm with you so far.",S02E07,338
Then she took one look at Charlie's painting,S02E07,339
"and loved it, so",S02E07,340
You took the credit for it.,S02E07,341
"Well, I made Charlie,",S02E07,342
"so in a way, I made that painting.",S02E07,343
"Honey, by that logic, I made that painting too.",S02E07,344
Really? You carried that painting around,S02E07,345
inside of you for nine months?,S02E07,346
What?,S02E07,347
"Bob, I just wanna be the best at what I do.",S02E07,348
"Honey, you are the best",S02E07,349
at a lot of things.,S02E07,350
You're the best nurse.,S02E07,351
You're the best mommy.,S02E07,352
You're the best wife.,S02E07,353
-Go on.,S02E07,354
-Okay.,S02E07,355
I'll tell you what why don't we put Charlie to bed,S02E07,356
and then you and I can cuddle?,S02E07,357
Because you are also the best at that.,S02E07,358
I tired.,S02E07,359
I can't keep chasing you around,S02E07,360
All of this running is just bringing me down,S02E07,361
It's got me down,S02E07,362
Every time I look at you,S02E07,363
The angels sing,S02E07,364
I hope you hear them too,S02E07,365
"Oh, I hope you hear them too",S02E07,366
Got me feeling hypnotized,S02E07,367
"Girl, it makes me feel alive",S02E07,368
"Well, would you look at that",S02E07,369
Our ex-boyfriend's gonna win this thing.,S02E07,370
I don't care.,S02E07,371
I have a new boyfriend.,S02E07,372
You could too.,S02E07,373
It just it makes me so mad.,S02E07,374
"Because you two became an annoying couple, we can't compete.",S02E07,375
-Wait a minute.,S02E07,376
"-Ooh, I know that look.",S02E07,377
She's getting an idea.,S02E07,378
I never get that look.,S02E07,379
Me neither!,S02E07,380
Aww.,S02E07,381
"Oh! Man, I'm looking forward to tonight.",S02E07,382
"-Oh yeah, it should be a good game.",S02E07,383
-Game-shmame.,S02E07,384
There's a rumor Albert made fresh guacamole.,S02E07,385
The rumor is true.,S02E07,386
"Dad, I wanna go home.",S02E07,387
What? It's almost kick-off.,S02E07,388
We were playing witches versus warlocks 3,S02E07,389
-and he said I cheated.,S02E07,390
-Because you did cheat.,S02E07,391
I did not cheat.,S02E07,392
I beat you.,S02E07,393
"-Because you cheated! -Take it easy, guys.",S02E07,394
"-But, dad! -Lucas.",S02E07,395
Come with me.,S02E07,396
"Dad, I didn't cheat.",S02E07,397
-Really? -Yes!,S02E07,398
"Look, I've cheated before.",S02E07,399
"I'm good at it. If I had really cheated,",S02E07,400
he would not have known about it.,S02E07,401
This is an insult to my cheating,S02E07,402
"-and I will not stand for it! -Okay okay, all right.",S02E07,403
I think I understand.,S02E07,404
Couldn't you just say you cheated?,S02E07,405
You want me to apologize for something I didn't do?,S02E07,406
Albert made fresh guacamole.,S02E07,407
"Bob, my boy's pretty upset.",S02E07,408
"Now why don't you just have Gabe apologize to Lucas,",S02E07,409
so that you and I can enjoy the game?,S02E07,410
"No, I believe my boy, Bruce.",S02E07,411
"If he said he didn't cheat, he didn't cheat.",S02E07,412
"-Thanks dad. -Yeah, well,",S02E07,413
I think we should get going.,S02E07,414
"You know, Bob, I admire that you stood up for your son.",S02E07,415
-So you want us to stay? -No.,S02E07,416
Keeping the mytab.,S02E07,417
All right! Yeah!,S02E07,418

even though it might annoy someone's sister.,S02E07,425
I've been looking for,S02E07,426
Someone who can see,S02E07,427
Who I really am,S02E07,428

I'm just really happy.,S02E07,468
"Oh no, I'm cool with that.",S02E07,469
"Hey, Charlie, you remember my old boyfriend Spencer, right?",S02E07,470
Totally stomped him in battle of the bands!,S02E07,471
Did it feel good? Yes.,S02E07,472
"Yes, ma'am, it did.",S02E07,473
"-It also felt -Hey, do you want to keep it down over there?",S02E07,474
What are you doing?,S02E07,475
We are watching the big game,S02E07,476

which is every bit as good as being over,S02E07,478
-at Bruce and Lucas's house.,S02E07,479

"Good luck, Charlie.",S02E07,485

And some other things.,S02E08,18
This year I'll be sharing the stage with all the culpeppers.,S02E08,19
We're a wonderfully talented family.,S02E08,20

I have great news.,S02E08,28
The entire Duncan family is going to compete,S02E08,29
in this year's hospital talent show.,S02E08,30
Cool. What's the great news?,S02E08,31
"Come on, you guys, how can we lose?",S02E08,32
We have the world's most perfect baby.,S02E08,33
I mean look at that face. What happened to your face?,S02E08,34

"- Yeah, me too. - Oh really, you guys are too busy?",S02E08,37
"Well, did I happen to mention that the grand prize",S02E08,38

Super adventure land?,S02E08,40
- The funnest place on earth? - Fran's going down.,S02E08,41
Fran's going down.,S02E08,42
Fran's going d,S02E08,43
Forgot my keys.,S02E08,44
"- You have a great evening, Fran.",S02E08,45
- Okay.,S02E08,46
Fran's going down.,S02E08,47
Day's all burnt toast,S02E08,48
"Running late, and dad says",S02E08,49
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S02E08,50
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S02E08,51
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S02E08,52
There it is up on the roof,S02E08,53
"I've been there, I've survived",S02E08,54
So just take my advice,S02E08,55
"Hang in there, baby, things are crazy",S02E08,56
But I know your future is bright,S02E08,57
"Hang in there, Baby",S02E08,58
There is no maybe,S02E08,59
Eveything turns out all right,S02E08,60
Sure life is up and down,S02E08,61
"But trust me, it comes back all around",S02E08,62
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S02E08,63
"Hang in there, Baby",S02E08,64
"Thanks for walking me to class, ray-ray.",S02E08,65
"Anytime, I-I.",S02E08,66
"So, looks like you're getting pretty cozy with Raymond.",S02E08,67
Ray-ray.,S02E08,68
That's what I call him.,S02E08,69
I'm gonna stick with Raymond.,S02E08,70
"Aw, look at those two.",S02E08,71
We could be double-dating if you were still,S02E08,72
going out with Spencer.,S02E08,73
"Oh, you mean spence-spence?",S02E08,74
"Hi, having a party tonight.",S02E08,75
Hope you can make it.,S02E08,76
"Hi, having a party tonight.",S02E08,77
Hope you can make it.,S02E08,78
Hi,S02E08,79
"Hi, having a party tonight.",S02E08,80
Hope you can make it.,S02E08,81
Something tells me,S02E08,82
Lynette doesn't want me at her party.,S02E08,83
"Well, if she doesn't want my best friend,",S02E08,84
she's not getting me.,S02E08,85
Or me.,S02E08,86
That's kind of where we started.,S02E08,87
"Okay, class.",S02E08,88
This is a very exciting time of year,S02E08,89
Mock court.,S02E08,90
We're going to learn how our justice system works,S02E08,91
by having our own trial right here in class.,S02E08,92
"- Teddy, you'll be the prosecuting attorney. - Yes!",S02E08,93
Somebody's going down. Who's it gonna be?,S02E08,94
"Lynette, you'll be the defendant.",S02E08,95
And the system works.,S02E08,96
"Spencer, you'll be the defense lawyer.",S02E08,97
"Walter, you'll be the judge.",S02E08,98
Yes! I can already taste the power.,S02E08,99
That one might be a mistake.,S02E08,100
"Ivy, you'll be the witness for the prosecution.",S02E08,101
And the rest of you,S02E08,102
will make up the jury.,S02E08,103
"If anyone needs me, I'll be at my desk",S02E08,104
finishing my sudoku.,S02E08,105
"Hey, Counselor.",S02E08,106
"I gotta warn you, my dad's a lawyer,",S02E08,107
so I might have an advantage.,S02E08,108
Oh yeah.,S02E08,109
"No, I'm not worried.",S02E08,110
- My dad's an exterminator. - What does that mean?,S02E08,111
I'm gonna crush you like a bug.,S02E08,112
"- Hey, where'd you get the dummy? - I bought it online.",S02E08,113
- I wasn't talking to you.,S02E08,114
- Ha ha ha ha.,S02E08,115
I'm gonna put him in my car.,S02E08,116
That way I can use the carpool lane,S02E08,117
when I'm making kwikki chikki deliveries.,S02E08,118
So people can get their crummy chicken quicker?,S02E08,119
Right.,S02E08,120
Everybody wins.,S02E08,121
"Well, except the people who eat the chicken.",S02E08,122
And the chickens.,S02E08,123
I guess I'm the only one who really wins.,S02E08,124
"You know, I'm getting an idea here.",S02E08,125
"You bought this piece of junk online, right?",S02E08,126
Who are you talking to?,S02E08,127
I'm talking to you now.,S02E08,128
"Oh, yeah yeah, I bought him online.",S02E08,129
"Well, maybe there's people out there who wanna buy our junk.",S02E08,130
Not following you.,S02E08,131
"I'm saying if there's people stupid enough to buy dummies,",S02E08,132
maybe they're stupid enough to buy our crummy stuff.,S02E08,133
- Still talking to me? - Ugh.,S02E08,134
"Now, miss wentz, please tell the court what happened next.",S02E08,135
- My ray-ray misses me with seven exclamation points.,S02E08,136
"Ivy, focus.",S02E08,137
"Mm, ray-ray says I look hot today,",S02E08,138
but only with six exclamation points.,S02E08,139
- Should I be worried? - Moving on.,S02E08,140
Okay.,S02E08,141
Now let's talk about what you're going to wear on the stand.,S02E08,142
You don't want to be too flashy.,S02E08,143
"T, you've seen my closet.",S02E08,144
It's mostly zebra stripes and leopard print.,S02E08,145
And those are my church clothes.,S02E08,146
"Okay, well, then you're gonna have to go through",S02E08,147
- your mom's closet. - What?,S02E08,148
You want me to wear my mom's clothes to school?,S02E08,149
- Mm-hmm. - In front of my boyfriend?,S02E08,150
I've had this dream.,S02E08,151
It did not end well.,S02E08,152
"Ivy, for one day you can tone it down.",S02E08,153
Then you have the rest of the school year,S02E08,154
to dress like the animal of your choice.,S02E08,155
"Oh, it's getting late.",S02E08,156
I gotta go.,S02E08,157
It's my dad's birthday.,S02E08,158
"Oh sorry, one more thing.",S02E08,159
"When you're on the stand tomorrow, you have to be very serious.",S02E08,160
- It wouldn't hurt to cry a little.,S02E08,161
- Don't worry.,S02E08,162
"If I'm wearing my mom's clothes, I'll be crying.",S02E08,163
"Okay, this is our number for the show.",S02E08,164
P.,S02E08,165
J.,S02E08,166
", hit it.",S02E08,167
We're the singin' dancin' Duncans,S02E08,168
quite a happy bunch,S02E08,169
we will always work together,S02E08,170
"breakfast, din and lunch",S02E08,171
you will always see us smiling,S02E08,172
"evening, noon and morn",S02E08,173
we all start our day the very same way,S02E08,174
when Charlie blows her horn.,S02E08,175
And Charlie blows her horn.  What do you think?,S02E08,176
"It's a two-day pass to super adventure land, right?",S02E08,177
That is correct.,S02E08,178
"Okay, now I'm going to",S02E08,179
show you the dance that goes along with it.,S02E08,180
The first move very simple.,S02E08,181
"I call it the chug, kind of like what a train does.",S02E08,182
"A-one, two, three.",S02E08,183
"A-one, two, three.",S02E08,184
"And a-one, two, three.",S02E08,185
"Okay, you guys line up and you do it.",S02E08,186
- Daddy in front.,S02E08,187
- All right.,S02E08,188

J.,S02E08,190
", Teddy, Gabe.",S02E08,191
- Okay.,S02E08,192
- I guess dad's the engine.,S02E08,193
- I hope so.,S02E08,194
"If he's the caboose, this train's not getting very far.",S02E08,195
"The engine has ears, guys",S02E08,196
And feelings.,S02E08,197
"Okay, ready?",S02E08,198
"A-five, six, seven, eight.",S02E08,199
"And one, two, three.",S02E08,200
"And one, two, three.",S02E08,201
"- And honey, you're not moving your feet.",S02E08,202
- Sorry.,S02E08,203
"Okay, now you're not moving your arms.",S02E08,204
"Honey, this is hard.",S02E08,205
"Dad, it's just like patting your head and rubbing your stomach.",S02E08,206
That must be really depressing for you.,S02E08,207
"Okay, let's assume we got the train",S02E08,208
into the station somehow.,S02E08,209
"Okay, this next part is a little tricky,",S02E08,210
so watch carefully.,S02E08,211
I'm gonna break it down. Ready?,S02E08,212
"Five, six, seven, eight.",S02E08,213
"Touch, step, pas de bourree.",S02E08,214
"Kick, step, together, front and passe.",S02E08,215
"Turn, wait, ba-bam!",S02E08,216
Now we're gonna sass it up a bit.,S02E08,217
"A-shoulder shoulder, tap tap.",S02E08,218
Turn around and uh uh.,S02E08,219
"And whammy, and whammy, and whammy.",S02E08,220
"Okay, now I want you to do exactly what I just did.",S02E08,221
"And a-five, six, seven, eight.",S02E08,222
"One, two",S02E08,223
What are you waiting for?,S02E08,224
10 years of dance lessons.,S02E08,225
I can't believe how much money we're making,S02E08,226
selling our old junk online.,S02E08,227
It's easier than taking candy from a baby.,S02E08,228
"I mean, I should know.",S02E08,229
I take candy from Charlie all the time.,S02E08,230
What's what's with all the bubble wrap?,S02E08,231
Uh really fun to pop?,S02E08,232
"Hey, anybody seen my bowling ball?",S02E08,233
You loaned it to Mr.,S02E08,234
Dabney.,S02E08,235
I think I would have remembered that.,S02E08,236

"Dude, we gotta be more careful.",S02E08,242
"Sooner or later, dad's gonna know he's missing stuff.",S02E08,243
- I wouldn't worry about that. - Why not?,S02E08,244
I just sold his glasses.,S02E08,245
"Oh no, this is terrible.",S02E08,246
"And there's nothing we can do, you say?",S02E08,247
"Thanks for calling, Fran.",S02E08,248
"Bob, I can't believe this.",S02E08,249
- The benefit's been canceled. - What?,S02E08,250

I don't have the heart to cook dinner either.,S02E08,260
No problem.,S02E08,261
We go out.,S02E08,262
"Okay, we go out.",S02E08,263
You're so good.,S02E08,264

Is this what you wanted?,S02E08,266
"- Yeah, it's fine.",S02E08,267

"Oh, my phone must have been off.",S02E08,271

"Yes yes, I did.",S02E08,274
And you weren't there.,S02E08,275
"- I wasn't? - No no, you weren't.",S02E08,276
And so I wished your dad a Happy Birthday,S02E08,277
"and then he said, My birthday's not for six months.",S02E08,278
Is this class ever gonna start?,S02E08,279
"How are you doing, Ivy?",S02E08,280
"Hey, Lynette.",S02E08,281
Ugh.,S02E08,282
Since when are you two so friendly?,S02E08,283
What are you talking about?,S02E08,284
No.,S02E08,285

You went to Lynette's party last night.,S02E08,287
"- Nuh-uh! - Oh, don't you nuh-uh me.",S02E08,288

"Okay, so if you weren't at Lynette's party last night,",S02E08,290
- then where were you? - That is none of your business.,S02E08,291
"No, see, it is my business because you lied to me.",S02E08,292
This is not over.,S02E08,293
Unbelievable.,S02E08,294
And they say government is a boring class.,S02E08,295
They're right.,S02E08,296
"Your witness, counselor.",S02E08,297
"Miss wentz, please tell us in your own words",S02E08,298

and slipped me a threatening note.,S02E08,302
Hmm. And do you see that person,S02E08,303
here in this courtroom?,S02E08,304
Yeah.,S02E08,305

Hmm.,S02E08,307
And have you seen this person anywhere else recently?,S02E08,308
Like at a party?,S02E08,309
A party I wasn't invited to?,S02E08,310
Objection. What does this have to do with anything?,S02E08,311
I'll allow it,S02E08,312
since I wasn't invited either.,S02E08,313
"Now, miss wentz,",S02E08,314
did you or did you not go to Lynette's party?,S02E08,315
I don't want to answer that.,S02E08,316

"- see you tonight, baby.",S02E08,330
"- You know it, ray-ray.",S02E08,331
"Wait, so why were you out with my ex-boyfriend?",S02E08,332
I was hanging out with Raymond.,S02E08,333
And he wanted to hang out with Spencer.,S02E08,334
"I felt weird about it, but I went along.",S02E08,335
And I didn't tell you because I knew you wouldn't like it.,S02E08,336
"Why wouldn't she like it? You said we're friends, right?",S02E08,337
"Oh please, everyone says that after they break up.",S02E08,338
"- So we're not friends? - No, of course we are.",S02E08,339
"Okay, I'm confused. Are we friends or not?",S02E08,340
"If we are, then why are you mad that I was hanging out with Ivy?",S02E08,341
"No no, I'm not mad!",S02E08,342
"Okay, I'm mad because I",S02E08,343

for tonight's benefit.,S02E08,351
That is interesting.,S02E08,352
Why is that interesting?,S02E08,353
"Because if the benefit was really cancelled, like your mom said,",S02E08,354
why would Fran culpepper need cookies?,S02E08,355
"Ah, I see where you're going with this.",S02E08,356
Mom baked cookies and she didn't tell us.,S02E08,357
"Uh, going somewhere?",S02E08,358
"Charlie can't sleep, so I thought I'd take her out for a drive.",S02E08,359
"A little dolled up, aren't we?",S02E08,360

I don't like it.,S02E08,378
I know.,S02E08,379
I don't like it either.,S02E08,380
I know I messed up.,S02E08,381
It's just I've never had a boyfriend before.,S02E08,382
I didn't know what to do.,S02E08,383
"Look, Ivy, there are gonna be times",S02E08,384
when you have a boyfriend and I don't,S02E08,385
or when I have a boyfriend and you don't.,S02E08,386

Another image to keep me up at night.,S02E09,14
"Actually, our football coach thought that taking ballet",S02E09,15
would help our agility and balance.,S02E09,16
Either that or he was just really messing with us.,S02E09,17
You should've seen your dad in his tights.,S02E09,18
He looked hot.,S02E09,19
"Yeah, the whole idea of hot",S02E09,20

"Okay, Teddy honey, what did you do?",S02E09,119
What? Nothing.I just got mad at a teacher,S02E09,120
"because he lowered my grade for not filling in a stupid oval,",S02E09,121
so I snapped one of his stupid pencils.,S02E09,122
That's it?,S02E09,123
I've waited my whole life for that?,S02E09,124
"Teddy honey, I'm not hearing that you did anything wrong.",S02E09,125

"Yeah, and I think you learn a lot about a person on a first date.",S02E10,105
Like what?,S02E10,106
Like sometimes their name.,S02E10,107
Or if the relationship is meant to be.,S02E10,108
- Really? - Yeah.,S02E10,109
An awesome first date sets the tone for the entire relationship.,S02E10,110
I saw it on a cover of a magazine.,S02E10,111
Just the cover? Did you read the article?,S02E10,112
"No, I'm not a big reader.",S02E10,113
We are so right for each other.,S02E10,114
Unh-unh-unh. How do I know until we've had our first date?,S02E10,115
"Okay, all right, well, where do you wanna go on our awesome first date?",S02E10,116
What date? No one's asked me out yet.,S02E10,117
- Hint hint.,S02E10,118
- Right.,S02E10,119
"Right, okay. Well, Skyler, would you like to",S02E10,120
"Oops, I think my earring just fell out.",S02E10,121
- Uh-oh. - Do you see it?,S02E10,122
No.,S02E10,123
Wait.,S02E10,124
Wait.,S02E10,125
"Oh, yeah, here it is.",S02E10,126
Got it. Where was I?,S02E10,127
"Oh, yeah. Skyler, would you",S02E10,128
- P.,S02E10,129
J.,S02E10,130
", what are you doing?! - Dad, I was.",S02E10,131
I was about to ask Skyler a very important question.,S02E10,132
You're 17 years old.,S02E10,133
You work at kwikki chikki. You wanna ruin your life forever?,S02E10,134
I was just gonna ask her out on a date.,S02E10,135
Oh.,S02E10,136
Have fun.,S02E10,137
Li'l tots forts o' fun Charlie is gonna love this.,S02E10,138
Now let's rip this baby open and slap her together.,S02E10,139
Whoa whoa whoa.,S02E10,140
Slow down.,S02E10,141
Slow down.,S02E10,142
"Before we do any ripping and slapping,",S02E10,143
we're gonna read the directions.,S02E10,144
"Bob, that always takes forever.",S02E10,145
"Honey, the directions are the difference between a fort and firewood.",S02E10,146
We don't need directions.,S02E10,147
All we have to do is look at the picture on the box and make that.,S02E10,148
Just look at the picture and make that.,S02E10,149
"Well, that explains your cooking.",S02E10,150
I'm gonna go get some reading glasses.,S02E10,151
Do not touch anything,S02E10,152
until I get back.,S02E10,153
I won't.,S02E10,154
Take your time.,S02E10,155
"Stop! Whoa whoa whoa, stop stop! What are you doing?",S02E10,156
I'm making these two pieces fit.,S02E10,157
I almost got it.,S02E10,158
"No no, no more kicking.",S02E10,159
We have to read the directions.,S02E10,160
We don't have to read the directions to know that this piece,S02E10,161
fits into this piece pretty much.,S02E10,162
- Gimme this.,S02E10,163
"- No, would you just let me do this.",S02E10,164
"Gimme this. You don't know what you're doing,",S02E10,165
and somebody might get hurt.,S02E10,166
Are you okay?,S02E10,167
Because I'm seeing three of you right now,S02E10,168
"and I don't even wanna see one of you,",S02E10,169
I'm gonna let you build this by yourself.,S02E10,170
Thank you.,S02E10,171
From all of us.,S02E10,172
"Gabe, are your parents coming or not?",S02E10,173
"Mrs. Monroe, how many fingers am I holding up?",S02E10,174

"- Yeah, they're on their way.",S02E10,176
- Hello. - Mom!,S02E10,177

Mr.,S02E10,190
"Duncan, I didn't know you were british.",S02E10,191
"Yeah, neither did Mrs.",S02E10,192
Duncan.,S02E10,193
That's right.,S02E10,194

What an interesting accent.,S02E10,196
What part of england are you from?,S02E10,197
Ostrich-shi-shi-shire.,S02E10,198
Pardon.,S02E10,199
Ostrich-shi-shi-shire.,S02E10,200
I don't believe I've heard of ostrichshire.,S02E10,201
"You one shi short, love.",S02E10,202
"Dad, I'm in trouble.",S02E10,203
Let's focus on that.,S02E10,204
"Yes, Gabe has been misbehaving",S02E10,205
and I thought we should talk about it.,S02E10,206
"Yes, rest assured, we are aware,",S02E10,207
and are going to put an end to this behavior.,S02E10,208
"Yes, I will be taking the young lad out",S02E10,209
to the hollyhock house where we'll Shepherd his pie.,S02E10,210
- What? - It's just something they say,S02E10,211
in ostrich-shi-shi where he's from.,S02E10,212
"- Hey, dad.",S02E10,213
- Hey.,S02E10,214
Why are you wearing a fake mustache?,S02E10,215
Why aren't you wearing one?,S02E10,216
"I do enjoy our talks, son.",S02E10,217
"Hey, while we're talking,",S02E10,218
what's your idea of a perfect first date?,S02E10,219
First date? First date.,S02E10,220
"No, I'm sorry.",S02E10,221
I really need an answer on that mustache.,S02E10,222
Fine.,S02E10,223
I was pretending to be a british version of you.,S02E10,224
So you got a question about dating.,S02E10,225
"Yeah, I gotta come up with something great for Skyler,",S02E10,226
but I don't have any ideas.,S02E10,227
How about a moonlight picnic?,S02E10,228
"You can drive up into the mountains, look out over the lights of the city.",S02E10,229
Sounds romantic.,S02E10,230
- Yeah.,S02E10,231
- I like it.,S02E10,232
"Thanks, dad.",S02E10,233
"- Hey, dad.",S02E10,234
- Hey.,S02E10,235
Why are you wearing a fake mustache?,S02E10,236
Why aren't you wearing one?,S02E10,237
"Charlie, before you know it,",S02E10,238
you're gonna have something a lot better than a box to play in.,S02E10,239
Now let me just finish off this last nail,S02E10,240
and,S02E10,241
"Then again, that box looks pretty fun.",S02E10,242
"- Oh, hey.",S02E10,243

Would you sit down? Trying to do the celebrity word scramble here.,S02E10,250
Julia Roberts!,S02E10,251
"Teddy, I gotta ask you something.",S02E10,252
Is there a reason that you didn't want me to come to your house?,S02E10,253
"No, what are talking about?",S02E10,254
Ryan Reynolds.,S02E10,255
Do it in your head.,S02E10,256
I don't know. I kinda got the vibe that maybe,S02E10,257
you don't wanna introduce me to your family.,S02E10,258
"No, it's not that I don't want them to meet you.",S02E10,259
It's that I don't want them to meet your motorcycle,S02E10,260
and your biker boots and your leather jacket,S02E10,261
with the skull on it.,S02E10,262
"Teddy, I don't wanna be somebody",S02E10,263
you have to hide from your parents.,S02E10,264
- Zac Efron! - Come on!,S02E10,265
You know what? I like you the way you are.,S02E10,266
That's all that matters.,S02E10,267

Cool.,S02E10,269
- Here you go.,S02E10,270
"- Thank you, mother.",S02E10,271
That's Gabe's mother.,S02E10,272
And that's not her husband.,S02E10,273
"Relax, maybe they're just friends.",S02E10,274
Or not.,S02E10,275
"Diet, mother?",S02E10,276
You're 41 years old and single.,S02E10,277
"Yeah, diet.",S02E10,278

- Guess somebody was wrong.,S02E10,285
"- Charlie, honey, who was wrong? - Daddy!",S02E10,286
"Well, daddy's very impressed.",S02E10,287
And a little shocked.,S02E10,288
And mommy is gonna do a victory dance.,S02E10,289
"I'm right, you're wrong",S02E10,290
"- I'm right, you're wrong, I'm right.",S02E10,291

Why are we talking?,S02E10,302
Forgot to give this to your wife.,S02E10,303
What is it?,S02E10,304
It's the bill for assembling your play structure.,S02E10,305
You put that together?,S02E10,306
"Yep, turned out pretty good, huh?",S02E10,307
Couldn't possibly have turned out better.,S02E10,308
"Well, if you'd like to reflect your satisfaction with a tip.",S02E10,309
"- Bye-bye, Tim. - You know, I take",S02E10,310
How are you enjoying our first date so far?,S02E10,311

Take something out of the picnic basket.,S02E10,320
Or put something in.,S02E10,321
Your choice.,S02E10,322
Help!,S02E10,323
Help!,S02E10,324
"Gabe, Gabe, watch Charlie!",S02E10,325
Bob! What happened?,S02E10,326
I don't know.,S02E10,327
I was just standing here admiring the swing set,S02E10,328
"You know, the one you put together all by yourself",S02E10,329
And then boom!,S02E10,330
The whole thing came down on top of me.,S02E10,331
- Are you okay? - I don't know.,S02E10,332
I just I feel so sleepy.,S02E10,333

"Oh, could you put this back together again please?",S02E10,354
"Sure, then tomorrow you want me to come back",S02E10,355

No.,S02E10,357
"Gosh, Tim, we're not crazy.",S02E10,358
I am so glad you're giving me a second chance.,S02E10,359
Let's just pretend our first date never happened.,S02E10,360
What first date?,S02E10,361
The one where I puked in the picnic basket.,S02E10,362
"No, it's an expression.",S02E10,363
Puked in the picnic basket's an expression?,S02E10,364

Which I would like to do just with my parents,S02E10,402

"Stay warm, love.",S02E10,404
Don't wanna freeze off your English muffins.,S02E10,405
"Grandma, grandpa!",S02E10,406
What's going on?,S02E10,407
I'm Gabe's teacher.,S02E10,408
I came to talk to his parents.,S02E10,409
We're his parents.,S02E10,410
"That's right, grandpa.",S02E10,411
You're my dad.,S02E10,412
He thinks he's the president too.,S02E10,413

Duncan.,S02E10,426
"Oh, please, call me Bob.",S02E10,427
"Yeah, turns out I was worried about nothing.",S02E10,428
My new boyfriend is dad's new best friend.,S02E10,429
Maybe I do have something to worry about.,S02E10,430
"And things are cool between me and Skyler,",S02E10,431
after I explained I wasn't married to my sister.,S02E10,432
"Yeah, that would have been awful.",S02E10,433
- Talk about puke in the picnic basket.,S02E10,434
- Right.,S02E10,435
"- What? - Oh, it's an expression.",S02E10,436
Yeah.,S02E10,437

"And of course,",S02E10,440
your swing set has now collapsed three times.,S02E10,441
"Good luck, Charlie.",S02E10,442
"- What are you doing? - Sorry to trouble you, governor,",S02E10,443

And then it was cancalled because I was bad.,S02E11,4
And it was too close to Christmas and then I was banned again.,S02E11,5
I guess we never did have a party for him.,S02E11,6
Well I suppose we could have one for him now.,S02E11,7
"I mean we do love him as much as the other kids, right?",S02E11,8
Oh,S02E11,9
Well,S02E11,10

Now you're talking.,S02E11,22

Can't be mean to your brother and sisters?,S02E11,27
-No problem. -Can't make fun of my cooking?,S02E11,28
Harder but I can do that.,S02E11,29

Ho ho.,S02E11,31
Bye bye Boom Zone.,S02E11,32
No dad.,S02E11,33
"Dad, you're wrong.",S02E11,34
I can do this.,S02E11,35
"For the next week, I will not say anything about your weight.",S02E11,36
-Really? -Yeah.,S02E11,37
-Good luck with that.,S02E11,38
"-Thanks, baldie.",S02E11,39
Today's all burnt toast ,S02E11,40

Has anybody seen my left shoe,S02E11,42

So just take my advice,S02E11,47
"Hang in there, baby",S02E11,48
Things are crazy,S02E11,49
But I know your future's bright,S02E11,50
"Hang in there, baby",S02E11,51
There's no maybe,S02E11,52
Everything turns out all right,S02E11,53
Your life is up and down,S02E11,54
But trust me it comes back around,S02E11,55
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S02E11,56
"Hang in there, baby.",S02E11,57
"-No, you tell her.",S02E11,58
"-No, you.",S02E11,59
"-No, you.",S02E11,60
"-No no, you tell her.",S02E11,61
Somebody!,S02E11,62
"Okay, so Derek said the deepest thing.",S02E11,63
"-Tell her, sweetie.",S02E11,64
-I was looking at my cereal this morning.,S02E11,65
And I was thinking wow no two flakes are exactly alike.,S02E11,66
"That's snowflakes, not cornflakes.",S02E11,67
I actually wrote a poem about it.,S02E11,68
"If you wanna hear it, I will be reading my next poetry slam.",S02E11,69
"-We'll be there. -Um, actually,",S02E11,70
I got another slam to go to that night.,S02E11,71
Derek didn't say what night it was.,S02E11,72
I got slams all week.,S02E11,73
I'm just slammed.,S02E11,74
-We'll be there.,S02E11,75
-Cool.,S02E11,76
I gotta go.,S02E11,77
"You know, babe, if you wanna get up and read something,",S02E11,78
-That would be awesome.,S02E11,79
-Okay.,S02E11,80
Cool.,S02E11,81
The theme of the night is pain.,S02E11,82
Okay.,S02E11,83
-See ya.,S02E11,84
-Okay.,S02E11,85
You're gonna write a poem,S02E11,86
About pain then get up and read it?,S02E11,87
I don't think so.,S02E11,88
You just said you would.,S02E11,89
-I did? -Yes.,S02E11,90
-When he put his arm on your shoulder.,S02E11,91
-Oh darn.,S02E11,92
Whenever he does that I can't think straight.,S02E11,93
Uh-huh.,S02E11,94
So did you really like.,S02E11,95
-That thing he said about cereal? -What did he say about cereal?,S02E11,96
"Hey, honey, these pants are too tight.",S02E11,97
Where are the new bigger ones I bought?,S02E11,98
Those are the new bigger ones.,S02E11,99
I'm leaving.,S02E11,100
This is not a safe environment for me.,S02E11,101
These pants aren't so tight.,S02E11,102
I can make this work.,S02E11,103
"Okay, Bob honey,",S02E11,104
"I love you to pieces, my dear,",S02E11,105
But your waistline has now become a safety issue for the children.,S02E11,106
"Honey, I would love to lose a couple of pounds,",S02E11,107
But diets just don't seem to work for me.,S02E11,108
"Well, dad, it's not just abo",S02E11,109
"Dad, it's not about dieting.",S02E11,110
What you need is healthier eating choices combined with exercise.,S02E11,111
"-What is that supposed to mean? -Less bacon, more shakin'.",S02E11,112
"I can help you out, be like your trainer.",S02E11,113
Okay.,S02E11,114
"Thank you very much, but I don't need your help.",S02E11,115
"Yup, split the underwear too.",S02E11,116
Get started in the morning?,S02E11,117
"Uh, Teddy, are you okay?",S02E11,118
"No, my cereal's not speaking to me.",S02E11,119
Has your cereal spoken to you before?,S02E11,120
"No, I just I need some inspiration.",S02E11,121
I told Derek that I'd read an original poem.,S02E11,122
On Saturday night and so far I've got nothing.,S02E11,123
Poetry you say?,S02E11,124
Have I ever mentioned that I write poetry?,S02E11,125
"Mom, please don't make this about you.",S02E11,126
"Of course, that would be selfish.",S02E11,127
Ooh! I wrote a great poem about selfishness.,S02E11,128
It goes like this: me me me me,S02E11,129
Mom!,S02E11,130
Sorry.,S02E11,131
"Okay, what is your poem supposed to be about?",S02E11,132
"Well, it's supposed to be about pain,",S02E11,133
But I can't think about anything painful.,S02E11,134
"I have happily-married parents,",S02E11,135
"A roof over my head, food on my table.",S02E11,136
Why'd you guys have to give me such a good life?,S02E11,137
Ah.,S02E11,138
-All right! -Okay.,S02E11,139
"-Let's go! -Looking good, dad.",S02E11,140
"For starters, thank you for not wearing a tank top.",S02E11,141
"All right, what do we do first?",S02E11,142
We Sambacise.,S02E11,143
-Whis this? -This is a celebrity workout program.,S02E11,144
Which combines exercise with samba dancing.,S02E11,145
"Oh, I don't know. This isn't gonna make me look stupid, is it?",S02E11,146
"Well, that's a big yes.",S02E11,147
"Come on, dad, just give it a chance.",S02E11,148
Look how much fun Betty white's having.,S02E11,149
"Wow, that woman is everywhere.",S02E11,150
-Just follow me.,S02E11,151
-Uh-huh.,S02E11,152
-To the side. -Whoa!,S02E11,153
"-Yeah, and watch this part wha! -Oh! Look at that!",S02E11,154
"Yeah, keep going, dad.",S02E11,155
"There you go, there you go.",S02E11,156
"Hey, wait a minute.",S02E11,157
Betty's got a rose.,S02E11,158
"Well, way ahead of you, dad.",S02E11,159
"-Thank you, sir.",S02E11,160
-Uh-huh.,S02E11,161
"All right, here we go.",S02E11,162
Yeah!,S02E11,163
Ain't bad.,S02E11,164
Anything on your mind?,S02E11,165
"I can make fun of this, right?",S02E11,166
"I mean, this doesn't have anything to do with your weight.",S02E11,167
"Oh, yes it does.",S02E11,168
I'm doing this to loweight.,S02E11,169
Big finish.,S02E11,170
Ah!,S02E11,171
"deep, gut-wrenching pain,",S02E11,172
Like an animal devouring me from the inside out,S02E11,173
I cried in agony.,S02E11,174
Then gave into the beast.,S02E11,175
Thank you.,S02E11,176
That was called cereal.,S02E11,177
"-Okay, you're up.",S02E11,178
-Okay.,S02E11,179
Okay.,S02E11,180
Hello.,S02E11,181
Hello.,S02E11,182
Hi.,S02E11,183
I'm Teddy Duncan.,S02E11,184
And this is called nosebleed.,S02E11,185
"blood blood, watch it flow,",S02E11,186
"From my nose it did go,",S02E11,187
"I was a screamer, I was a crier,",S02E11,188
"The doctor called for a humidifier,",S02E11,189
"We tried ice, we tried cotton,",S02E11,190
I put my head way back,S02E11,191
Nuttin'.,S02E11,192
Thank you.,S02E11,193
Was it really as bad as I thought?,S02E11,194
No.,S02E11,195
"No no, it was",S02E11,196
"It wa oh, uh,",S02E11,197
-I gotta take this.,S02E11,198
-Oh.,S02E11,199
Hello.,S02E11,200
"Okay, fake phone call was it really that bad?",S02E11,201
Hang on. Hello?,S02E11,202
Hey! Stop that.,S02E11,203
I can't believe I just made.,S02E11,204
A complete fool of myself in front of Derek.,S02E11,205
So? Who cares what Derek thinks?,S02E11,206
I do.,S02E11,207
He's my boyfriend.,S02E11,208
"Look, he's fine for now,",S02E11,209
"But he isn't exactly a keeper, right?",S02E11,210
-What do you mean? -Come on.,S02E11,211
You guys are so different.,S02E11,212
Well different? How are we different?,S02E11,213
You're smart.,S02E11,214
He's Derek.,S02E11,215
You're fun.,S02E11,216
He's Derek.,S02E11,217
You're interesting.,S02E11,218
He's Derek.,S02E11,219
So you don't like Derek?,S02E11,220
Okay.,S02E11,221
"Well, maybe I don't like your boyfriend.",S02E11,222
And what is wrong with my ray-ray?,S02E11,223
"Well, the fact that you call him ray-ray for starters.",S02E11,224
ray-ray said this.,S02E11,225
Ray-ray said that.,S02E11,226
Sometimes I just pray-pray.,S02E11,227
You'll shut up about ray-ray.,S02E11,228
"Well, your prayers have just been answered,",S02E11,229
Because I'm never talking to you again.,S02E11,230
"Well, that that's right!",S02E11,231
Go run-run away-way to ray-ray!,S02E11,232
"Look no, it's not a poem.",S02E11,233
But you liked it?,S02E11,234
"Whoa, it is really coming down out there.",S02E11,235
"Well, mom, it wasn't easy,",S02E11,236
But I've been good for an entire week.,S02E11,237
"Boom zone, here I come!",S02E11,238
"I have to say, Gabe, you have really earned this party.",S02E11,239
Hmm.,S02E11,240
Here you go.,S02E11,241
-What's this? -It's a list of bad things,S02E11,242
I thought of saying but didn't.,S02E11,243
Part one is fat jokes about dad.,S02E11,244
"Gabe, there's nothing funny about",S02E11,245
That one's pretty good.,S02E11,246
I like that one.,S02E11,247
"Oh, that one's even better.",S02E11,248
That one,S02E11,249
What? What's so funny?,S02E11,250
Nothing.,S02E11,251
Ooh! Cake.,S02E11,252
"dear dad, be strong.",S02E11,253
Do not eat this cake.,S02E11,254
"Love, your son and trainer P.",S02E11,255
J.,S02E11,256
"dear dad,",S02E11,257
so you've thrown away my first note.,S02E11,258
Here is a second chance to make the right decision.,S02E11,259
"Your son who believes in you, P.",S02E11,260
J.,S02E11,261
"dear dad,",S02E11,262
"Okay, so notes aren't your thing.",S02E11,263
"-Hi, Mrs.",S02E11,264
Wentz.,S02E11,265
-Hey.,S02E11,266
"Goodness, Teddy, get in here.",S02E11,267
"Oh wow, it's really snowing out there.",S02E11,268
I could barely park in your driveway.,S02E11,269
We don't have a driveway.,S02E11,270
Okay.,S02E11,271
"Well, I know where it could go.",S02E11,272
Can I talk to Ivy?,S02E11,273
We got in a fight last night and I really need to apologize.,S02E11,274
"Oh, I'm sorry, Teddy.",S02E11,275
Ivy's not here.,S02E11,276
She went to your house because she said she needed to apologize to you.,S02E11,277
-She did? -Mm-hmm.,S02E11,278
"Okay, well, I I'd better go home then.",S02E11,279
"Oh no, Teddy, you're not going anywhere.",S02E11,280
"Hi, Mr.",S02E11,281
Wentz.,S02E11,282
"Come on, take a look at this.",S02E11,283
"-Okay. -Now as you can see,",S02E11,284
"We've got a high-pressure system stalled over the Rockies,",S02E11,285
And it's pushing cold arctic air down from Canada.,S02E11,286
Giving us a freak spring blizzard.,S02E11,287
"-Oh. -Harry always wanted to be a weatherman,",S02E11,288
But he answered the call of plumbing supplies.,S02E11,289
Mmm.,S02E11,290
Breaking news.,S02E11,291
"They've just closed all the roads,",S02E11,292
"And that means that you, young lady,",S02E11,293
"Are gonna be staying right here, maybe overnight.",S02E11,294
"What? I'm sorry, I can't stay overnight.",S02E11,295
I'd like to also send a shout out to Abner Johnson.,S02E11,296
He's 104 today.,S02E11,297
Who is he talking to?,S02E11,298
Nobody. Harry,S02E11,299
"You do know that you're not really on tv, right?",S02E11,300
"Of course I do. Back to you, Mary lo",S02E11,301
"We're expecting up to two feet of snow today,",S02E11,302
So stay in your homes and off the roads.,S02E11,303
Ivy? Get in here.,S02E11,304
What are you doing here?,S02E11,305
I came over to apologize to Teddy.,S02E11,306
Teddy went to your house to apologize to you.,S02E11,307
"-What? -And now the roads are all closed,",S02E11,308
So you're gonna be stuck here awhile.,S02E11,309
Really? You mean overnight?,S02E11,310
Even maybe a few days?,S02E11,311
-Yes! -Ah.,S02E11,312
"Let's go, people.",S02E11,313
We've got a party to go to.,S02E11,314
"Gabe honey, I'm afraid we have some bad news.",S02E11,315
Just tell me on the way to the boom zone.,S02E11,316
"No no. Come sit with mama, okay?",S02E11,317
Okay.,S02E11,318
"Now, sweetie, because of the blizzard,",S02E11,319
Nobody's able to drive anywhere and,S02E11,320
I'm afraid your party is off.,S02E11,321
What?! Again?!,S02E11,322
"-No no, take a deep breath. -I can't believe this!",S02E11,323
I've been keeping my mouth shut for nothing?!,S02E11,324
"-Okay, Gabe, just calm -Save it, tubby!",S02E11,325
"-Hey, Gabe! -Your cooking stinks! And you're stupid!",S02E11,326
-I didn't say anything.,S02E11,327
"-Yeah, but you were thinking something stupid.",S02E11,328
I hate my life!,S02E11,329
Man.,S02E11,330
This is so much better than my house.,S02E11,331
"You see, Teddy, most people actually think.",S02E11,332
"That when the temperature rises,",S02E11,333
So does the barometric pressure,S02E11,334
But that is not the case.,S02E11,335
"Harry, leave that girl alone.",S02E11,336
"Let's do something Teddy would enjoy, like",S02E11,337
A Jigsaw puzzle.,S02E11,338
Oh!,S02E11,339
"-Gabe, are you okay? -Leave me alone.",S02E11,340
"Look, babe, I know how you feel.",S02E11,341
"No, you don't.",S02E11,342
You've never gone without a party on your birthday.,S02E11,343
You've had like a million of them.,S02E11,344
"Okay, I'm gonna let that one go,",S02E11,345
Because I know you're hurting right now.,S02E11,346
But I promise you: You are going to have a birthday party.,S02E11,347
"Yeah, when I'm 100.",S02E11,348
And I can't even blow out my candles?,S02E11,349
"Okay, if you're referring to grandpa,",S02E11,350
He's only 70 and he has asthma.,S02E11,351
"Teddy, you've hardly touched your liver and onions.",S02E11,352
Mmm.,S02E11,353
I had liver for breakfast.,S02E11,354
Got any requests?,S02E11,355
How about a snowmobile?,S02E11,356
How about row row row your boat?,S02E11,357
It's my favorite.,S02E11,358
Come on.,S02E11,359
"Actually, Mr. Wentz, you really don't have to",S02E11,360
Row row row your boat gently down the stream,S02E11,361
"Merrily merrily merrily merrily, life is but a dream. ",S02E11,362
We can't do this when Ivy's home.,S02E11,363
She won't let us.,S02E11,364
Ha.,S02E11,365
I miss her so much.,S02E11,366
Rounds!,S02E11,367
-Oh! -Row row row your boat,S02E11,368
-Teddy! -Row row row your boat ,S02E11,369
Row row row your boat gently down the stream ,S02E11,370
"Whatever this is, I'm sure it's gonna be lame.",S02E11,371
"Oh, I don't think so.",S02E11,372
"Hit it, Charlie.",S02E11,373
Surprise!,S02E11,374
Happy Birthday!,S02E11,375
-What's all this? -What's all this?,S02E11,376
It's the Duncan fun zone!,S02E11,377
"Well, since we can't go to your party,",S02E11,378
We brought the party to you.,S02E11,379
Look out below!,S02E11,380
-Oh! -Oh!,S02E11,381
-Oh! -You want a turn?,S02E11,382
You look kinda sick.,S02E11,383
Yeah. Of course I want a turn!,S02E11,384
All right!,S02E11,385
Row row row your boat gently down the stream ,S02E11,386
"Merrily merrily merrily merrily, life",S02E11,387
"Wait wait. Guys guys, does this song have an ending?",S02E11,388
"If it does, we've never found it.",S02E11,389
Now,S02E11,390
In German!,S02E11,391

-Yay! -Hey!,S02E11,401
"Thanks, everybody.",S02E11,402
This really has been the best party ever.,S02E11,403
"Look, I'm sorry I called you fat,",S02E11,404
Stupid and a bad cook.,S02E11,405
"I mean, even though you are fat, stupid and a bad cook",S02E11,406
I love you all.,S02E11,407
"Well, we love you too.",S02E11,408
"Not as much as the others, of course",S02E11,409
But,S02E11,410
"-Teddy! -Hey, everybody.",S02E11,411
"-Hey! -Oh, hey.",S02E11,412
What are you doing here? The roads are all closed.,S02E11,413
"-Yeah, I walked. -Why did you do that?",S02E11,414
I think I can answer that.,S02E11,415
-Liver and onions? -Yup.,S02E11,416
-Jigsaw puzzle? -Uh-huh.,S02E11,417
-row row row your boat? -In German.,S02E11,418
-Come here.,S02E11,419
-Okay.,S02E11,420
"Well, Charlie, the storm's over,",S02E11,421
"Sun's shining, Gabe had a great party.",S02E11,422
"And ooh, best of all,",S02E11,423
"Thanks to sambacising, dad's lost two pounds.",S02E11,424
"Yeah, he was so excited, he's now graduated to",S02E11,425
Tangocise!,S02E11,426
Oh!,S02E11,427
Ay-yi-yi.,S02E11,428
"Good luck, Charlie.",S02E11,429
Huh.,S02E11,430
"Finally, we are alone.",S02E11,431
-Nuh-uh-uh. -Whoa-ho-ho!,S02E11,432
How did you,S02E11,433
But it was but how how did you,S02E11,434
Now grab an apple and go back to bed.,S02E11,435
"-You're just a head, right?  -Yes",S02E11,436
"-No arms, no legs? -Nope.",S02E11,437
"-Got eyes though, right? -Of course.",S02E11,438
"-Well, then you can watch me.",S02E11,439
-No.,S02E11,440
No no.,S02E11,441
No no no no no!,S02E11,442
Now I'm wishing I didn't have eyes.,S02E11,443
-Wish you didn't have teeth? -No no!,S02E11,444
"Hey, dad, I want to sign up for hockey.",S02E12,0
"-No, you don't.",S02E12,1
"-Yeah, I do.",S02E12,2
"No, you don't! Keep your voice down.",S02E12,3
Why? What's wrong with hockey?,S02E12,4
Shh shh shh!,S02E12,5
Did someone say hockey?,S02E12,6
"N-no, honey.",S02E12,7
I said I was feeling a little,S02E12,8
Stocky.,S02E12,9
I heard the word hockey come up from the air vent.,S02E12,10
I asked if I could play hockey and then dad got all weird.,S02E12,11
I have been dreaming of the day.,S02E12,12
When one of my kids strapped on the skates.,S02E12,13
And followed in mama's footsteps.,S02E12,14
-I feel a story coming on.,S02E12,15
-I was the star.,S02E12,16
Of the southwest Denver community college lady icers.,S02E12,17
-You even had a cute nickname.,S02E12,18
-They called me psycho.,S02E12,19
Broke the league record for penalty minutes.,S02E12,20
-And that's why they called me -Psycho.,S02E12,21
I got it.,S02E12,22
Can I play hockey?,S02E12,23
"Not only can you play hockey,",S02E12,24
I'm gonna teach you everything I know about the sport.,S02E12,25
"No, that's okay, mom.",S02E12,26
They actually have coaches.,S02E12,27
Coach I'll be your coach!,S02E12,28
-Great idea! - Coach psycho.,S02E12,29
-Psycho.,S02E12,30
"-That's right, Charlie.",S02E12,31
Mommy's psycho.,S02E12,32
Today's all burnt toast ,S02E12,33
"Running late, and dad jokes",S02E12,34
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S02E12,35
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S02E12,36
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S02E12,37
There it is up on the roof,S02E12,38
"I've been there, I've survived",S02E12,39
So just take my advice,S02E12,40
"Hang in there, baby",S02E12,41
Things are crazy,S02E12,42
But I know your future's bright,S02E12,43
"Hang in there, baby",S02E12,44
There's no maybe,S02E12,45
Everything turns out all right,S02E12,46
Your life is up and down,S02E12,47
But trust me it comes back around,S02E12,48
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S02E12,49
"Hang in there, baby.",S02E12,50
"-Okay, see you tomorrow, babe.",S02E12,51
-Okay.,S02E12,52
"Oh, hey, Derek,",S02E12,53
I was wondering if maybe after school.,S02E12,54
"-You wanna go mini golfing? -Eh, whatever.",S02E12,55
"Okay, so, um, is that a whatever like",S02E12,56
"I don't wanna go, or a whatever like",S02E12,57
"mini golf, wow!?",S02E12,58
Whichever.,S02E12,59
"Okay okay, so is that a whichever like whatever",S02E12,60
"Or a whichever like mini golf, wow!?",S02E12,61
-No worries.,S02E12,62
-Whatever.,S02E12,63
"-'kay, see you, babe.",S02E12,64
-Okay.,S02E12,65
"Ivy, can I ask you something?",S02E12,66
"-Sure, what's up? -It's about Derek.",S02E12,67
And I want you to be completely honest.,S02E12,68
"You know, we've been going out for a while.",S02E12,69
"And at first it was fun and everything, but now",S02E12,70
I'm kinda wondering if maybe I should,S02E12,71
Dump his sorry butt!,S02E12,72
-Whoa.,S02E12,73
-Do it! Now.,S02E12,74
He's probably still out there.,S02E12,75
I'll go get him.,S02E12,76
"Whoa, Ivy, Ivy, wait!",S02E12,77
I don't mean right now.,S02E12,78
I've never broken up with somebody before and I'm kind of nervous about it.,S02E12,79
-There's nothing to be nervous about.,S02E12,80
"-Well, I I don't know.",S02E12,81
It's easy.,S02E12,82
Look.,S02E12,83
Just pretend I'm Derek and break up with me.,S02E12,84
"If it helps,",S02E12,85
I'll put a stupid look on my face and breathe through my mouth.,S02E12,86
"No, I'm not gonna practice breaking up with somebody.",S02E12,87
"I mean, how hard can it be?",S02E12,88
I just tell Derek how I feel nicely,S02E12,89
And then we both go on with our lives.,S02E12,90
Heh heh.,S02E12,91
Whatever.,S02E12,92
"Okay, could you stop doing that, please?",S02E12,93
"Ehhh, I like it.",S02E12,94
It's relaxing.,S02E12,95
I feel like my brain's on vacation.,S02E12,96
"Okay, people, listen up.",S02E12,97
The geniuses at corporate have come up with a new menu item.,S02E12,98
They are called chicken slivers.,S02E12,99
-What's a sliver? Is it like a nugget? -No.,S02E12,100
-Is it like a tender? -Nope.,S02E12,101
"-Does it have chicken in it? -According to legal,",S02E12,102
The answer to that question is possibly.,S02E12,103
"And remember, they're not just chicken slivers,",S02E12,104
"They are corporal kwikki's chicken slivers,",S02E12,105
"In honor of our founder, corporal bull s.",S02E12,106
Kwikki.,S02E12,107
-What's he a corporal of? -Lip-smacking goodness.,S02E12,108
Which is also the title of his autobiography.,S02E12,109
"Okay, minimum wagers paychecks.",S02E12,110
-Thanks.,S02E12,111
-Thank you.,S02E12,112
"Mitch, aren't we supposed to be making minimum wage?",S02E12,113
It's the law.,S02E12,114
My dad told me about it.,S02E12,115
Never talk to your parents!,S02E12,116
"Seriously, guys, what happens here is sacred.",S02E12,117
This is a safe place.,S02E12,118
Wait a minute.,S02E12,119
minimum means the least.,S02E12,120
We're making less than the least?,S02E12,121
"Okay, doors opening,",S02E12,122
"Let's feed the world, huh?",S02E12,123
Isn't there something you can do about our salary?,S02E12,124
-Why me? -You're the smartest one here.,S02E12,125
I am?,S02E12,126
But my foot's in a mop bucket.,S02E12,127
"Yeah, but you know how to get it out.",S02E12,128
I thought we were going to the ice rink.,S02E12,129
No.,S02E12,130
You can't go anywhere near the ice until you learn the fundamentals.,S02E12,131
Sounds boring.,S02E12,132
It's not boring. It's fun!,S02E12,133
"Come on, you can't spell fundamental without fun.",S02E12,134
You also can't spell it without mental.,S02E12,135
"Okay, fundamental number one: Positioning.",S02E12,136
Why is there a pad on the wall?,S02E12,137
Because I believe in safety first.,S02E12,138
-What was that? -That's called checking.,S02E12,139
It's not allowed at your level,S02E12,140
Unless the ref doesn't see you.,S02E12,141
-Now you check me.,S02E12,142
"-No way, you're my mom.",S02E12,143
"Come on, check me, you little weenie.",S02E12,144
That's called avoiding a check.,S02E12,145
Get up.,S02E12,146
Let's practice your skating.,S02E12,147
"Okay, I will demonstrate.",S02E12,148
"Nice and easy, just like mama.",S02E12,149
-Now you try.,S02E12,150
-Okay.,S02E12,151
-Not bad. -Not bad?,S02E12,152
I'd say I'm pretty good.,S02E12,153
Never get comfortable.,S02E12,154
"-Hey, sweetie pie.",S02E12,155
"-Hey, dad.",S02E12,156
Actually I was,S02E12,157
"Hey, P.",S02E12,158
J.,S02E12,159
-You okay?  I got a big problem at work.,S02E12,160
I found out my boss is underpaying us.,S02E12,161
And now the staff wants me to do something about it.,S02E12,162
-Why you? -I'm the smartest.,S02E12,163
Um How exactly was that determined?,S02E12,164
I don't know.,S02E12,165
Probably a secret vote.,S02E12,166
Maybe a raffle.,S02E12,167
"Uh, well, what are you gonna do?",S02E12,168
I don't know.,S02E12,169
-I don't know.,S02E12,170
-P.,S02E12,171
J.,S02E12,172
!.,S02E12,173
You can't go through life answering every question with I don't know.,S02E12,174
Really?,S02E12,175
I have so far and I'm a senior in High School.,S02E12,176
Probably a raffle.,S02E12,177
"Um, look,",S02E12,178
"Son, if you think you deserve more money,",S02E12,179
Then stand up for yourself.,S02E12,180
"By the way, your coworkers, they are counting on you",S02E12,181
To be strong.,S02E12,182
"Oh man, I just found out I'm smart,",S02E12,183
Now I have to be strong too?,S02E12,184
"Enjoy your childhood, Charlie.",S02E12,185
It does not last forever.,S02E12,186
Cookie?,S02E12,187
P.,S02E12,188
J.,S02E12,189
Wuv a cookie.,S02E12,190
"Okay Okay okay, he's here.",S02E12,191
"Oh, Ivy, I don't know if I can do this.",S02E12,192
"My heart is pounding. Oh, hi, he sees me!",S02E12,193
He's waving.,S02E12,194
"All right, now I'm waving and smiling.",S02E12,195
This feels so wrong.,S02E12,196
Gotta go.,S02E12,197
"-Hey there, hi, Derek.",S02E12,198
-Hey.,S02E12,199
"Oh hi, thank you for meeting me.",S02E12,200
"-Hey, no worries. -Yeah, uh",S02E12,201
"Well, there might be a few.",S02E12,202
"Listen, I owe you an apology.",S02E12,203
-For what? -For blowing off that whole mini golf thing.,S02E12,204
"Oh no no no, that's okay.",S02E12,205
"No! No, it's not.",S02E12,206
You're my girl.,S02E12,207
"If you like mini golf, I should like mini golf.",S02E12,208
I don't like mini golf that much.,S02E12,209
And speaking of.,S02E12,210
-Not liking things - Wait.,S02E12,211
"Before you say anything else, I've got something for you.",S02E12,212
"Oh, ha ha.",S02E12,213
A leather jacket just like yours.,S02E12,214
"Yeah, except this one says d's girl.",S02E12,215
You like it?,S02E12,216
"What's not to like? I mean, I",S02E12,217
"I'm d's girl, now it says so",S02E12,218
On a jacket.,S02E12,219
"-Yeah, well, try it on.",S02E12,220
-Ooo-kay.,S02E12,221
"Wow, awesome.",S02E12,222
Now when you're on the back of my bike.,S02E12,223
Everyone will know who you are.,S02E12,224
D's girl.,S02E12,225
"-What's going on? -Mitch, we need to talk.",S02E12,226
You found out what's in the chicken?,S02E12,227
-No. -You found out what we feed the chickens?,S02E12,228
-No. -Is this about the finger in the fingers?,S02E12,229
-What?! -Why don't you.,S02E12,230
Tell me what this is about?,S02E12,231
-We want a raise.,S02E12,232
-A raise.,S02E12,233
Okay.,S02E12,234

That's not even a real month!,S02E12,239
"Right, P.",S02E12,240

All right.,S02E12,249

"Come on, guys.",S02E12,251
-You'll be sorry.,S02E12,252

"Uh, I'm kinda sorry.",S02E12,254
I left my wallet in the break room.,S02E12,255
"All right, guys, we're on strike.",S02E12,256
Yeah!,S02E12,257
What do we do now?,S02E12,258
I don't know.,S02E12,259
"While we figure out what a strike is,",S02E12,260
Let's get out of the way and let the customers in.,S02E12,261

"Nurse Duncan, patient in 312 needs a sponge bath.",S02E12,268
"Rhonda, can you handle that?",S02E12,269
I'm dealing with a family crisis right here.,S02E12,270
Thank you.,S02E12,271
"What up, girl?",S02E12,272
This is what's up.,S02E12,273

"Yeah, I tried, but then he gave me this jacket.",S02E12,275
And now I don't know what to do.,S02E12,276
"Honey, these things are never easy, but the longer.",S02E12,277
You let it go on the worse it's gonna be.,S02E12,278
"Okay, just promise yourself.",S02E12,279

You're all fired.,S02E12,309
-That's not fair.,S02E12,310
-Tell that to the genius.,S02E12,311

-Yeah.,S02E12,332
-I know.,S02E12,333
-I'm really sorry.,S02E12,334
I I-I can't help feeling kind of responsible for all this.,S02E12,335
"Well, you are responsible, so your feeling is correct.",S02E12,336
"Look, there's gotta be somebody you can talk to.",S02E12,337
-Go over your boss's head. -To who?,S02E12,338
Not even corporal bull s.,S02E12,339
Kwikki himself could save us now.,S02E12,340
The guy in the ads?,S02E12,341
He's real?,S02E12,342
"Yeah, of course he's real.",S02E12,343
And he really has a horse named curly fry?,S02E12,344
That was a joke in a commercial.,S02E12,345
You don't even know your history.,S02E12,346
Okay.,S02E12,347
"-You ready? -Yeah, I'm ready.",S02E12,348

There's something I want to say.,S02E12,354
I'm just gonna say it.,S02E12,355
This might be a little tough because I know you're into me.,S02E12,356
"You got me that jacket, but, uh,",S02E12,357
The thing is,S02E12,358
I think we should break up.,S02E12,359
Uh Okay.,S02E12,360

"I mean, well, if it's not working",S02E12,371
"It wasn't working for me, but it was working for you, right?",S02E12,372

Again.,S02E12,377
"Okay, I'm sorry.",S02E12,378
I'm breaking your heart here.,S02E12,379
The polite response.,S02E12,380
Would be to show a little bit of emotion!,S02E12,381
"-Hey, how are we doing over here? -Not so great!",S02E12,382
I just broke up with Derek and he's taking it really well!,S02E12,383
"-But that's good, right? -No!",S02E12,384
"No no, I want him to be devastated.",S02E12,385
Why aren't you devastated?,S02E12,386
"Teddy, people are staring.",S02E12,387
"Oh ho ho,",S02E12,388
So I'm embarrassing you?,S02E12,389

"-Whoa whoa! -First breakup, people.",S02E12,391
"Oh no, this breakup's not over!",S02E12,392
I'm calling you later!,S02E12,393

Do not stay in touch.,S02E12,395
I never liked you.,S02E12,396
Atten-hut!,S02E12,397
Corporal bull s.,S02E12,398
Kwikki is in the corral.,S02E12,399
"-What are you doing here? -Excuse me, pardner.",S02E12,400
I heard there was some feuding going on down here.,S02E12,401
At franchise 157.,S02E12,402
Labor dispute.,S02E12,403
"May I say, corporal,",S02E12,404
"Um, you look somewhat bigger in person.",S02E12,405
"Uh, yes.",S02E12,406
"Well, the promotional department.",S02E12,407
Thinks I'm more relatable to the peoples.,S02E12,408
When I'm all shrunk down like that.,S02E12,409
"Let me ask you, corporal,",S02E12,410
Where exactly did you come from?,S02E12,411
"Oh, out yonder.",S02E12,412
And exactly which state.,S02E12,413
Is yonder in?,S02E12,414
"Sir, that would be the great state of, uh",S02E12,415

For quietly sitting here eating my oatmeal.,S02E13,6

In the history of television: Higgins & Zork.,S02E13,71
"Frank Higgins, hardboiled human Detective.",S02E13,72
And his trigger-happy alien partner Zork!,S02E13,73
Together the two of them go through space.,S02E13,74
And they fight intergalactic crime.,S02E13,75
This is the important thing.,S02E13,76
You had to do while mom was gone?,S02E13,77
Yes.,S02E13,78
"Look, when your mom and I first got married,",S02E13,79
She thought I spent a little too much time watching the show.,S02E13,80
And going to conventions.,S02E13,81
And buying really cool costumes!,S02E13,82
But it's not like I have a problem.,S02E13,83

Check out Zork's.,S02E13,96
"No, Zork, stop.",S02E13,97
"Keep your cool, man.",S02E13,98
Neptune is a by-the-book planet.,S02E13,99
This is so good.,S02E13,100
"Whoa, what is this place?",S02E13,101
Why would the driver take us to a,S02E13,102
-A tv studio? -I have no idea.,S02E13,103
"But if aunt Nell's on a spending spree,",S02E13,104

Show the Duncans to their dressing rooms,S02E13,134

Anything cat-related.,S02E13,146
"Cat books, Cat clocks, Cat pictures,",S02E13,147
"-Cat clothes -Yeah yeah, we got it.",S02E13,148
Oh! Lucky for you we have.,S02E13,149
This genuine wooden Cat bowl.,S02E13,150
What makes that a Cat bowl?,S02E13,151
A Cat could drink out of it.,S02E13,152
Or do his business in it.,S02E13,153
I knew I was wasting my time.,S02E13,154
"Wait wait wait,",S02E13,155

"One, two, three.",S02E13,175
-$49.,S02E13,176
-11 cents.,S02E13,177
This could take awhile.,S02E13,178
"Well, it's not as big as we're used to,",S02E13,179
But it'll do.,S02E13,180
-Sisters? -The Duncan sisters.,S02E13,181
Have you lost your mind?,S02E13,182
"Teddy, this is my chance to be on tv.",S02E13,183
"Mom, this is nuts.",S02E13,184
We can't do this.,S02E13,185

Mm-hmm.,S02E13,189
And they decided you couldn't.,S02E13,190
"Look, the point is I really want to do this.",S02E13,191
It's my dream.,S02E13,192
"I mean, there's just one problem.",S02E13,193
We don't know any dance routines.,S02E13,194
So? We'll find someone to help us.,S02E13,195

"And this is Charlie, our baby sister.",S02E13,207
"Aw, Cece, look how cute she is.",S02E13,208
Our mother believes you're never too young to absorb the magic.,S02E13,209
"Oh, mom's kind of a nut log.",S02E13,210
You've always been jealous of our mom.,S02E13,211
"Right, we should get going.",S02E13,212
We're dancers on the show.,S02E13,213
"So if there's anything you need, just let us know.",S02E13,214
You're dancers? Actually,S02E13,215
"Uh, there is something you could do for us.",S02E13,216
Really? Wow.,S02E13,217
No one's actually ever taken us up on our offer before.,S02E13,218
"Yeah, haven't you guys ever heard of an empty gesture?",S02E13,219
Hang on one second.,S02E13,220
"Dad, your pizza's here!",S02E13,221
H-h-h-hang on.,S02E13,222
I've gotta get some money.,S02E13,223

There's $500 in that!,S02E13,229
"Wow, she got a really good deal.",S02E13,230
-Go get it back!  How are we supposed to do that?,S02E13,231
You know what? Not my problem.,S02E13,232
Right now I'm in the middle of a two-parter.,S02E13,233
Where Higgins and Zork go back in time to save pocahontas.,S02E13,234
Thank you.,S02E13,235
"Dude, how are we gonna get the cookie jar back?",S02E13,236

"Well, I would love to,",S02E13,248
"But with Charlie acting up like this,",S02E13,249
"Yeah, just",S02E13,250
"Maybe you should show us some of your dance moves,",S02E13,251
That way we can fit into your show's style.,S02E13,252
I don't want to come in here and shake it up.,S02E13,253
Ha ha.,S02E13,254
Good thing you're better dancers than comedians.,S02E13,255

"But for the record, you are delicious.",S02E13,273
"Oh, this trip just gets better and better.",S02E13,274
"Uh, Flynn, what are you talkin'about?",S02E13,275

"Second, she's always had this dream of being on tv.",S02E13,292
And it makes her do some crazy things sometimes.,S02E13,293
I'm so sorry.,S02E13,294
We'll just grab our stuff and go.,S02E13,295
-I'd better go with you. -Why?,S02E13,296
For protection.,S02E13,297
A babe like you shouldn't be walking around without some muscle.,S02E13,298
"Forget it, little dude.",S02E13,299
You got no shot.,S02E13,300
"Yeah, like that's gonna stop him.",S02E13,301
"Cece, her mom has the same dream we had.",S02E13,302
I mean maybe we should help her.,S02E13,303
"-What's in it for us? -Well, nothing.",S02E13,304
It's just a nice thing to do.,S02E13,305
Oh! And then after.,S02E13,306

Come here.,S02E13,311
"A five, six, seven, eight.",S02E13,312
Wait a minute.,S02E13,313
"The Duncans may not be great dancers,",S02E13,314
But they do have one thing going for them.,S02E13,315
That people will feel sorry for them.,S02E13,316
"Okay, two things.",S02E13,317

Feast your eyes on this.,S02E13,322

"Did you find anything, perhaps, inside the jar?",S02E13,334
"No, but I found $500 taped to the lid.",S02E13,335

-What's all this? -I came to give you a haircut.,S02E14,114

But I always go to Rachel at crazy cuts.,S02E14,116
-Not anymore. -What do you mean?,S02E14,117
Ahh!,S02E14,118

"Eh, five more minutes.",S02E14,122
-Why are you sitting with me? -Because I didn't realize it was you.,S02E14,123
Why are you dressed like that?,S02E14,124
"-I don't want Dustin to recognize me. -Oh, the ponytail kid?",S02E14,125
You're worried he's going to get back at you?,S02E14,126
"He has gotten into my dreams, my nap dreams.",S02E14,127
That is a place filled with gumdrops and lollipops.,S02E14,128
-He does not belong there! -Okay.,S02E14,129
"Well, I'm sorry you had a bad nap,",S02E14,130
but I've got a real problem.,S02E14,131
I have to come up with a good news story by Friday.,S02E14,132
This could be my chance to be on local tv.,S02E14,133
Ugh!,S02E14,134
"You want a good story, you should do a report.",S02E14,135
On whatever this mystery meat is.,S02E14,136
Wait a minute.,S02E14,137
That's not bad.,S02E14,138
I'll solve the mystery meat mystery.,S02E14,139
This disgusting slop could be my ticket to the big time.,S02E14,140
"-How's lunch today? -Oh, really good, thanks.",S02E14,141
"Hey, honey.",S02E14,142
-You get some shoes? -Did I get some shoes? Did I get some shoes?,S02E14,143
I don't know.,S02E14,144
You tell me.,S02E14,145
Ba-bam.,S02E14,146
Wow! Nice!,S02E14,147
"-Yeah, and only $400. -What?!",S02E14,148
"Relax, I'm going to return them the day after the dinner.",S02E14,149
I'm just borrowing them.,S02E14,150
They're like a library book that makes my calves look hot.,S02E14,151
"Honey, no store is going to take back shoes once you've worn them.",S02E14,152
They're not going to know that I've worn them.,S02E14,153
I'm putting tape on the soles so they don't scuff.,S02E14,154
Where did you learn this stuff?,S02E14,155
It's an old trick from my starving student days.,S02E14,156
"I thought I'd outgrow it when I was married,",S02E14,157
But four kids later and here we are ba-bam!,S02E14,158
I don't know.,S02E14,159
Sounds wrong to me.,S02E14,160
-Or we can just pay the $400.,S02E14,161
-I'll get the tape.,S02E14,162
So you cut a kid's hair in kindergarten.,S02E14,163
And now you're all freaked out?,S02E14,164
It was the worst thing I ever did.,S02E14,165
"I don't know, maybe I should just apologize.",S02E14,166
"Apologize? I'd cut his hair again, show him who's boss.",S02E14,167
"Okay, guys, what do we think, huh?",S02E14,168
Huh? Ready for the country club?,S02E14,169
"I don't know, dad.",S02E14,170
Button the jacket.,S02E14,171
That's not going to happen.,S02E14,172
So I'm guessing the top button of your pants.,S02E14,173
Is out of the question too?,S02E14,174
"Yes, sir, it is.",S02E14,175
"Bob, a little help, please?",S02E14,176
"-Need a little help, please? -What? Whoa, what's wrong?",S02E14,177
Turns out that putting tape on your shoes makes them.,S02E14,178
Just a little bit slippery.,S02E14,179
"Well, why don't you change shoes?",S02E14,180
"What, and kill the glamour?",S02E14,181
How'd you like to pay all that money.,S02E14,182
To join the country club and see that coming in?,S02E14,183
What is the meat in mystery meat?,S02E14,184
"To find out,",S02E14,185
I decided to sit down with Lydia the lunch lady.,S02E14,186
And ask her some tough questions.,S02E14,187
"-Pretty good so far, huh? -Shh! Ow.",S02E14,188
"So, Lydia, let's get right to it.",S02E14,189
Tell me about the meat.,S02E14,190
Does that camera have to be so close?,S02E14,191
Why are you sweating?,S02E14,192
Because you're shining a very bright light in my face!,S02E14,193
Or is it because you're lying?,S02E14,194
"What is it, Lydia? What is the meat?",S02E14,195
-Ground beef. -Is it?,S02E14,196
Or is it something else?,S02E14,197
Mystery meat is it really such a mystery?,S02E14,198
This is Teddy Duncan and I'm on your side.,S02E14,199
"-So, what do you think? -I can't submit this.",S02E14,200
"-Why not? -Because there are no facts, no proof.",S02E14,201
"I'm sorry, but it stinks.",S02E14,202
But I need that internship.,S02E14,203
I want to be on tv.,S02E14,204
Then you'd better come up with something great by tomorrow.,S02E14,205
"-Oh well, just watch me.",S02E14,206
-I don't think you can do it.,S02E14,207
-I'm going to make you eat those words.,S02E14,208
-Do you want to kiss me.,S02E14,209
"-As much as I want to kiss you? -No, I don't.",S02E14,210
Worth a shot.,S02E14,211
"-Aw, that movie was awesome! -So awesome!",S02E14,212
"When the blood shot out of that guy's arm,",S02E14,213
-It looked so real! -So real!,S02E14,214
What are you guys talking about?,S02E14,215
"-Uh, nothing.",S02E14,216
-We just saw decapitation 3.,S02E14,217
"-No, we didn't.",S02E14,218
"-Yes, we did.",S02E14,219
Remember I almost barfed when they used.,S02E14,220
That lady's head as a bowling ball?,S02E14,221
Wait wait wait.,S02E14,222
That movie's rated pg-13.,S02E14,223
Who took you guys to go see it?,S02E14,224
His mom.,S02E14,225
His dad.,S02E14,226
We slipped the guy at the box office.,S02E14,227
Five extra bucks and he let us in.,S02E14,228
What is wrong with you?,S02E14,229
She's a direct pipeline to the man.,S02E14,230
And by the man I mean my mom.,S02E14,231
"Okay, so that sleazeball at the movie theater.",S02E14,232
Is taking bribes from kids?,S02E14,233
That's Fantastic!,S02E14,234
-It is? -Yes yes.,S02E14,235
This is exactly the kind of story I need.,S02E14,236
"This is going to put me on tv, where I belong.",S02E14,237
You sound like mom.,S02E14,238
Shut up.,S02E14,239
"Ugh, nice job.",S02E14,240

"Um, uh, when I got home last night,",S02E14,250
I put them in the box and went to bed.,S02E14,251
"Then I got out of bed to go to the bathroom, put them back on,",S02E14,252
"Went to the bathroom, put them back in the box and went to bed.",S02E14,253
"Wait, why would you put on shoes to go to the bathroom?",S02E14,254
Because they make everything an event.,S02E14,255
"Honey, look, the only event right now is that we're out $400.",S02E14,256
We've got to find the shoes!,S02E14,257
"-Hey, guys.",S02E14,258
-Hey.,S02E14,259

"And because she was wearing high heels, she slipped and fell.",S02E14,262
-What heels? -These.,S02E14,263
-No! -Yeah.,S02E14,264

I don't know if you remember me.,S02E14,273
-We went to kindergarten together. -We did?,S02E14,274
"Yeah yeah,",S02E14,275
I was the kid who glued his face to the desk.,S02E14,276
I was the kid who got his tongue caught in the hamster wheel.,S02E14,277
I was the kid who cut off your ponytail.,S02E14,278
"Oh yeah, I remember that.",S02E14,279
Yeah yeah.,S02E14,280
"Listen, I know it's probably way too late for this,",S02E14,281
But I just I want to say I'm really sorry.,S02E14,282
"Eh, don't worry about it.",S02E14,283
It was a long time ago.,S02E14,284
-So you're not mad? -Not at all.,S02E14,285
"Oh, that's so great, man. You mind if I stay?",S02E14,286
-Sure sure.,S02E14,287

"Okay okay, you guys, come on. So here's the plan:",S02E14,290
"Gabe, you'll buy the tickets.",S02E14,291
"Jake, you'll wear this hat.",S02E14,292
It has a camera in it and it'll record the whole thing.,S02E14,293
I don't look good in hats.,S02E14,294
"Jake, come on, we got to do this.",S02E14,295
"Dude, my hair is my best feature.",S02E14,296
"Okay, well, if you guys don't go through with this,",S02E14,297
I'll tell both your moms about decapitation 3,S02E14,298
And 1 and 2.,S02E14,299
"-Uh, you know about those? -I do now.",S02E14,300
Can I at least wear it backwards?,S02E14,301
It's more hip hop that way.,S02E14,302
What he lacks in brains he makes up for in,S02E14,303
He's got a pool.,S02E14,304
Sponge.,S02E14,305
Marker.,S02E14,306
Pretzel.,S02E14,307
-Are they going to make it? -Shh.,S02E14,308
A very critical part of the operation.,S02E14,309
I need absolute quiet.,S02E14,310
"-Hey, guys! How's it going? -Ooh! My gosh!",S02E14,311
Did we lose her?,S02E14,312

"-Cool, thanks.",S02E14,320
-What are they doing? -I don't know.,S02E14,321

"Two tickets for decapitation 3, please.",S02E14,324
"Ooh, that's pg-13, guys.",S02E14,325

Enjoy the show.,S02E14,334
"-Okay, are we done now? -No no, you didn't get it.",S02E14,335
Jake was looking at the poster for fishy friendz.,S02E14,336
I couldn't help it.,S02E14,337
The fish was wearing glasses.,S02E14,338
That's hilarious!,S02E14,339
"All right, we're doing this again.",S02E14,340
This time I'm wearing the hat.,S02E14,341
Here.,S02E14,342
"Jake, you wait here.",S02E14,343
-One ticket for decapitation 3.  -Weren't you just here?,S02E14,344
"Yeah, I was here and you were there.",S02E14,345
And I gave you some money.,S02E14,346
Now do you want to do it again or not?,S02E14,347
"Okay, you know the drill.",S02E14,348
Handling fee.,S02E14,349
"Excuse me, did you just sell an 11-year-old boy.",S02E14,350
A ticket to a pg-13 movie?,S02E14,351
What? I I don't know what you're talking about.,S02E14,352
Oh yeah? Okay.,S02E14,353

Do it!,S02E14,361
"Busted! This is Teddy Duncan, teen reporter.",S02E14,362

Ah!,S02E14,371
"Dude, I just had the weirdest dream.",S02E14,372
Really? What about?,S02E14,373

To get back at me you shaved half my head.,S02E14,375
Wow.,S02E14,376
"Wow, that is crazy.",S02E14,377
"-Should we get some breakfast? -Yeah, sounds good.",S02E14,378

So what do you think?,S02E14,383
"It's hard-hitting, informative and entertaining.",S02E14,384
It's the best piece I've seen all semester and I'm killing it.,S02E14,385
-What? Why? -That box office guy is my brother.,S02E14,386

"Oh, my feet are killing me.",S02E14,398
"Mom, why did you wear your heels to work?",S02E14,399
"Oh, they make everything an event.",S02E14,400
"Oh. The store wouldn't take them back, huh?",S02E14,401
Laughed in my face.,S02E14,402
"See, this is a good lesson, Charlie.",S02E14,403
"If you try to pull a scam,",S02E14,404
You're going to suffer the consequences.,S02E14,405

Nothing I hadn't seen 100 times before.,S02E14,420
-Jake? -It was awesome!,S02E14,421
That's what you say about every movie.,S02E14,422

"Oh, okay.",S02E15,163

"I know, but we have finals tomorrow.",S02E15,211
"Dude, when you get older,",S02E15,212
do you want to look back at your two days in college,S02E15,213
"and say, all I did was study?",S02E15,214
I guess I could take a five-minute break.,S02E15,215
-Yes.,S02E15,216
-Yeah.,S02E15,217
Party!,S02E15,218
Teddy.,S02E15,219
Yeah?,S02E15,220
Have you been missing your laptop?,S02E15,221
"Yes, I've been looking all over for it.",S02E15,222
Found it.,S02E15,223
No.,S02E15,224
No no no no.,S02E15,225
Maybe it'll be okay.,S02E15,226
Or not.,S02E15,227
"Please work, please work, please work.",S02E15,228
How did it get in the dishwasher anyway?,S02E15,229
Charlie must have put it in there while I was talking to grandma.,S02E15,230
"Come on, boot up.",S02E15,231
"Come on, boot up.",S02E15,232
"-Come on, boot up.",S02E15,233
"-Teddy, Teddy, Teddy, stop it, stop it.",S02E15,234
It'll be okay.,S02E15,235
We'll get you a new one.,S02E15,236
"No, mom, you don't understand.",S02E15,237
All of my video diaries were on here.,S02E15,238
"Honey, I thought they were in your camera.",S02E15,239
"No no, I put them on my computer",S02E15,240
for safekeeping.,S02E15,241
"Oh, honey, honey, I'm so sorry.",S02E15,242
It's two years' worth of video diaries just down the drain.,S02E15,243
"Well, through the rinse cycle anyway.",S02E15,244
"Oh, now come on, come on.",S02E15,245
You'll make more video diaries and it'll all be okay.,S02E15,246
"-No, forget it.",S02E15,247
I'm not making any more.,S02E15,248
-Why not?.,S02E15,249
"If Charlie can't watch them from the beginning,",S02E15,250
then what's the point?,S02E15,251
"No no no, you were giving her such great advice",S02E15,252
about how to deal with life and relationships and her family.,S02E15,253
She's gonna need that.,S02E15,254
"Honey, I'm only gonna get crazier.",S02E15,255
"No, she's just gonna have to figure it out for herself.",S02E15,256
I'm done with the video diaries.,S02E15,257
It's such a shame.,S02E15,258
She worked so hard on those.,S02E15,259
And I was in so many of them.,S02E15,260
"See, Johnny?",S02E15,261
The clown doll isn't alive.,S02E15,262
"Okay, dad.",S02E15,263
But check the closet one more time.,S02E15,264
"Sure, sport.",S02E15,265
See? There's nothing to Arghh-hh!,S02E15,266
"It's okay, cocoa. It's only a movie",S02E15,267
A really scary movie.,S02E15,268
"Come on, Charlie.",S02E15,269
You're gonna sleep in P.,S02E15,270
J.,S02E15,271
's bed tonight.,S02E15,272
Come on.,S02E15,273
Okay.,S02E15,274
What's going on?,S02E15,275
"Um, well,",S02E15,276
Charlie was crying.,S02E15,277
I didn't hear anything.,S02E15,278
"Well, I did.",S02E15,279
And she sounded very very scared.,S02E15,280
So I thought she'd feel safer sleeping in here with me.,S02E15,281
So Charlie was scared?,S02E15,282
"Dad, I know it's late, but Charlie's stay with me.",S02E15,283
"All right, well,",S02E15,284
thanks for being such a good Big Brother,S02E15,285
all of a sudden.,S02E15,286
No problem.,S02E15,287
That's how we roll here at Gabe's place.,S02E15,288
"Honey, what's today's date?",S02E15,289
"January 7th, 2026.",S02E15,290
Look at me.,S02E15,291
I'm still writing 2025.,S02E15,292
"Charlie Duncan,",S02E15,293
your curfew was an hour ago.,S02E15,294
Whatever.,S02E15,295
"Don't you whatever us, young lady.",S02E15,296
And spit that gum out.,S02E15,297
You got it.,S02E15,298
"Oh, by the way, I quit school today.",S02E15,299
-You what? -And I'm running away with my boyfriend.,S02E15,300
You're running away with Snake?,S02E15,301
As soon as he gets out of jail.,S02E15,302
"I don't get it, Charlie.",S02E15,303
"You look so much like Teddy, but you're so different.",S02E15,304
"Oh, Teddy Teddy Teddy.",S02E15,305
I'm so sick of hearing about that clump nugget.,S02E15,306
Hey hey hey hey.,S02E15,307
Do not talk that way about the governor of Colorado.,S02E15,308
Why should I care about Teddy? What's she ever done for me?,S02E15,309
That sounds like Teddy now.,S02E15,310
I'm out of here.,S02E15,311
Hi mom.,S02E15,312
Hi dad.,S02E15,313
So how are you guys?,S02E15,314
"Well, not so good.",S02E15,315
Charlie's out of control again.,S02E15,316
I knew this would happen.,S02E15,317
If only I hadn't given up on those video diaries.,S02E15,318
"Honey, you can't blame yourself.",S02E15,319
"No, it's true.",S02E15,320
It's all my fault.,S02E15,321
It's all my fault.,S02E15,322
It's all my fault.,S02E15,323
It's all my fault.,S02E15,324
It's all my fault.,S02E15,325
"No, I can't do that to Charlie.",S02E15,326
Governor of Colorado Not bad.,S02E15,327
"-All right, dude, are you ready? -Yeah, sauce me.",S02E15,328
"Man, that's good hot sauce.",S02E15,329
"Dude, my mouth's on fire.",S02E15,330
"All right, dude, you know what? I gotta get back to studying.",S02E15,331
"Dude, the girls from hamburger tech just got here.",S02E15,332
P.,S02E15,333
J.,S02E15,334
", this is Patty, Patty and Patty.",S02E15,335
"Welcome to the party, party and party.",S02E15,336
What did you get me up in the middle of the night for?,S02E15,337
"Mom, I had a terrible dream.",S02E15,338
It was 15 years into the future and you and dad were there.,S02E15,339
How did I look?,S02E15,340
Really good.,S02E15,341
I'm listening.,S02E15,342
So Charlie had pink hair and this boyfriend named Snake.,S02E15,343
"Okay okay okay, hold on.",S02E15,344
How good did I look?,S02E15,345
"Fabulous. Anyway,",S02E15,346
I know how we can save the video diaries.,S02E15,347
We're gonna recreate them.,S02E15,348
Tonight?,S02E15,349
Yes.,S02E15,350
I'm not gonna be able to sleep until we get them all done.,S02E15,351
"Come on, let's get going.",S02E15,352
Hi Charlie.,S02E15,353
It's your big sister Teddy here.,S02E15,354
And I'm making this video diary to help you survive,S02E15,355
our special family.,S02E15,356
"Okay, perfect.",S02E15,357
"One down, 49 to go.",S02E15,358
"Honey, you didn't say good luck, Charlie.",S02E15,359
Grr!,S02E15,360
"So then Gabe's friend Jake said to mom,",S02E15,361
you can't do the hoops.,S02E15,362
You're too old.,S02E15,363
So mom said,S02E15,364
"In your face, Jake!",S02E15,365
Make sure to have your playdates at your friend's house.,S02E15,366
"Good luck, Charlie.",S02E15,367
"And if you ever drop your binky in a vase,",S02E15,368
"wish me good luck, Charlie.",S02E15,369
That one seems kind of lame.,S02E15,370
"Yeah, well, it happened.",S02E15,371
"Well, Charlie, your first trip to the pet store",S02E15,372
"didn't go so well. When we weren't looking,",S02E15,373
you put a little something in mom's purse a bunny.,S02E15,374
"Okay, wait, stop.",S02E15,375
This isn't working.,S02E15,376
That's so obviously Mrs.,S02E15,377
Dabney's cat with bunny ears.,S02E15,378
It's 2:00 in the morning.,S02E15,379
You want me to run the all-night bunny store?,S02E15,380
I really don't appreciate your attitude.,S02E15,381
"Hey, don't snap at me. I'm the one",S02E15,382
who jumped the fence and nabbed the cat.,S02E15,383
"All right, forget it. Let's just get him back",S02E15,384
before Mrs.,S02E15,385
Dabney notices.,S02E15,386
Get the lights.,S02E15,387
Get the lights.,S02E15,388
It's just a movie.,S02E15,389
It's just a movie.,S02E15,390
Oh! Oh!,S02E15,391
"Charlie, go back to bed.",S02E15,392
And take that evil clown doll with you.,S02E15,393
"Charlie, did you hear that?",S02E15,394
There it is again.,S02E15,395
"Charlie, wake up.",S02E15,396
"Hey hey hey, what's the matter?",S02E15,397
They got Charlie! She's been sucked into the portal!,S02E15,398
-What? -She's in the closet of doom!,S02E15,399
"No, dad, they'll get you too.",S02E15,400
Don't.,S02E15,401
Oh.,S02E15,402
"All right, my little monster.",S02E15,403
You know what?,S02E15,404
I think I'm gonna put you back in your own bed.,S02E15,405
What? You can't leave me in here alone.,S02E15,406
Would you rather sleep at Bob and Amy's place?,S02E15,407
Could I?,S02E15,408
All right.,S02E15,409
Are you coming?,S02E15,410
My two little babies.,S02E15,411
And time.,S02E15,412
Pencils down.,S02E15,413
Pass your papers forward.,S02E15,414
"Kwikki chikki, kwikki chikki.",S02E15,415
I will now grade your final examinations.,S02E15,416
Done.,S02E15,417
You've all passed.,S02E15,418
Yes!,S02E15,419
Quiet.,S02E15,420
It's not that big an accomplishment.,S02E15,421
"All right, graduation ceremony.",S02E15,422
Ha ha.,S02E15,423
It is now my honor,S02E15,424
"to present our commencement speaker,",S02E15,425
"the manager of franchise #268,",S02E15,426
Fred.,S02E15,427
It's hard to believe that 20 years ago,S02E15,428
I sat right where you are now.,S02E15,429
I too was a High School student,S02E15,430
about to enter the exciting world,S02E15,431
of kwikki chikki assistant management.,S02E15,432
Wow.,S02E15,433
"This career has provided me with so many things,",S02E15,434
like a room over my parents' garage,S02E15,435
and the use of the car three days a week.,S02E15,436
Do I regret not having a wife,S02E15,437
or kids or even a pet?,S02E15,438
Not for a moment.,S02E15,439
"And neither will you,",S02E15,440
after you go to work for kwikki chikki,S02E15,441
and stay there,S02E15,442
forever and ever.,S02E15,443
No!,S02E15,444
No.,S02E15,445
There goes P.,S02E15,446
J.,S02E15,447
Duncan.,S02E15,448
He was stupid.,S02E15,449
He was lazy.,S02E15,450
But he's still the best student,S02E15,451
this university ever had.,S02E15,452
Hey.,S02E15,453
What did you do to your mother?,S02E15,454
I just found her asleep on the toilet.,S02E15,455
"Oh, we stayed up all night",S02E15,456
remaking Charlie's video diaries,S02E15,457
when we weren't hiding in the dark from Mrs.,S02E15,458
dabney.,S02E15,459
"Hey, everybody.",S02E15,460
"Hey, how is it going, college boy?",S02E15,461
"Well, I did it.",S02E15,462
I graduated.,S02E15,463
"Congratulations. The future's all set, huh?",S02E15,464
No.,S02E15,465
"No, it's not.",S02E15,466
What?,S02E15,467
"Dad, I think",S02E15,468
I think I want something more than kwikki chikki.,S02E15,469
I think I want to go to a real college.,S02E15,470
"Okay, if that's what you want.",S02E15,471
"Hey, look, whatever you decide",S02E15,472
Fine with me.,S02E15,473
"Oh, Teddy.",S02E15,474
"Teddy, I almost forgot.",S02E15,475
I took your laptop by mistake.,S02E15,476
You what now?,S02E15,477
"Sorry, it was a mistake.",S02E15,478
They just look alike.,S02E15,479
That means my video diaries are okay.,S02E15,480
They're not ruined.,S02E15,481
Ruined?,S02E15,482
What happened to my laptop?,S02E15,483
A cute story.,S02E15,484
"Um, well, now it's cute.",S02E15,485
"Oh, P.",S02E15,486
J.,S02E15,487
!.,S02E15,488
-You're back! -Whoa.,S02E15,489
Yeah.,S02E15,490
"Oh, I missed you so much.",S02E15,491
Please don't ever leave home again.,S02E15,492
"Okay, I won't.",S02E15,493
"Hey, why is all my stuff in the garage?",S02E15,494
Oh.,S02E15,495
"Um, a cute story. Um",S02E15,496
Hey Charlie.,S02E15,497
So I'm finally getting the chance,S02E15,498
to do your 50th video diary.,S02E15,499
And I want to make it,S02E15,500
I want to,S02E15,501
I want to make it really special.,S02E15,502
"Teddy, Teddy.",S02E15,503
"Good luck, Charlie.",S02E15,504
"Hey, Gabe, Gabe, what is that?",S02E15,505
"Oh, that's just Charlie.",S02E15,506
"She's messing around, trying to scare us.",S02E15,507
That little scamp.,S02E15,508
I I I don't think that's Charlie.,S02E15,509
Let's see.,S02E15,510
"Whoa whoa whoa, what is going on in here?",S02E15,511
"Dad, in the closet Something horrible.",S02E15,512
It's a portal to another dimension.,S02E15,513
"Oh, give me a break.",S02E15,514
"Dad, dad, dad.",S02E15,515
Dad! Dad!,S02E15,516
"Hey, anything can happen at Gabe's place.",S02E15,517
"Okay, dad, so you know how I always want to go to super adventure land.",S02E16,0
"But you tell me it's too expensive,",S02E16,1
Even though it's totally worth it,S02E16,2
'cause it's the funnest place on earth?,S02E16,3
Yes.,S02E16,4
"Well, problem solved.",S02E16,5
"this coupon, good for $5 off admission price.",S02E16,6
To super adventure land.,S02E16,7
"Upon $100 purchase at Jensen's groceries,",S02E16,8
"Not valid Tuesday through Sunday,",S02E16,9
Closed Monday.,S02E16,10
Nice try.,S02E16,11
"But, dad,",S02E16,12
They have this new ride called the storm twizzler.,S02E16,13
Nine out of 10 people barf on it.,S02E16,14
They even take your photo.,S02E16,15
"Gabe, I'll take you to super adventure land.",S02E16,16
Just as soon as I win the lottery.,S02E16,17
"Oh, hey, speaking of which,",S02E16,18
Maybe today is your lucky day.,S02E16,19
Could be.,S02E16,20
Let's take a look.,S02E16,21
"Hey, there's a seven, right?",S02E16,22
-Yeah.,S02E16,23
-That's pretty good.,S02E16,24
"Hey, look at this.",S02E16,25
We got another seven.,S02E16,26
That's not too bad. One more seven we got,S02E16,27
"Oh, look at oh, look at oh!",S02E16,28
You're not going.,S02E16,29
Today's all burnt toast ,S02E16,30
"Running late, and dad jokes",S02E16,31
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S02E16,32
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S02E16,33
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S02E16,34
There it is up on the roof,S02E16,35
"I've been there, I've survived",S02E16,36
So just take my advice,S02E16,37
"Hang in there, baby",S02E16,38
Things are crazy,S02E16,39
But I know your future's bright,S02E16,40
"Hang in there, baby",S02E16,41
There's no maybe,S02E16,42
Everything turns out all right,S02E16,43
Your life is up and down,S02E16,44
But trust me it comes back around,S02E16,45
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S02E16,46
"Hang in there, baby.",S02E16,47
"Hey, mom.",S02E16,48
"Hey, honey.",S02E16,49
Come meet our new neighbor.,S02E16,50
This is my daughter Teddy.,S02E16,51
Debbie Dooley. How're you doing?,S02E16,52
"I'm doing dandy, Debbie Dooley.",S02E16,53
Debbie and her husband Doug just moved here from Iowa.,S02E16,54
Doug's our new deputy police chief.,S02E16,55
And they have a daughter Charlie's age.,S02E16,56
-Deedee dooley.,S02E16,57
-Oh.,S02E16,58
Debbie needed a babysitter for tomorrow.,S02E16,59
And I was just telling her how terrific you are.,S02E16,60
Oh yeah.,S02E16,61
"No, actually my friend Ivy and I.",S02E16,62
Were gonna take Charlie to make-a-monkey tomorrow.,S02E16,63
And we'd be happy to bring deedee along.,S02E16,64
What's make-a-monkey?,S02E16,65
"Oh, it's kind of complicated. It's this place where you",S02E16,66
You make A monkey. I,S02E16,67
I guess it's not that complicated.,S02E16,68
"Oh, I meant to ask",S02E16,69
Where is your dog?,S02E16,70
We don't have a dog.,S02E16,71
But that nice Mrs.,S02E16,72
Dabney next door told me.,S02E16,73
To beware of Gabe.,S02E16,74
Gabe is my son.,S02E16,75
But she said he bit her,S02E16,76
And went to the bathroom on her lawn.,S02E16,77
They have a very unique relationship.,S02E16,78
Welcome to the neighborhood.,S02E16,79
"Oh, I think this one goes",S02E16,80
No.,S02E16,81
"Oh, doesn't this one go?",S02E16,82
No.,S02E16,83
"Eh, forget it.",S02E16,84
Charlie can help us with it later.,S02E16,85
"Oh, my dad's outside.",S02E16,86
I gotta go.,S02E16,87
-He doesn't like to be kept waiting.,S02E16,88
-All right.,S02E16,89
-See ya.,S02E16,90
-See ya.,S02E16,91
No wonder we couldn't do it.,S02E16,92
It's for ages one to three.,S02E16,93
You P.,S02E16,94
J.,S02E16,95
?.,S02E16,96
"Uh, y-yeah yeah.",S02E16,97
That's me.,S02E16,98
So you start going out with a girl.,S02E16,99
And you don't think it's important to meet the father?,S02E16,100
"Oh, I'm sorry.",S02E16,101
Makes me wonder what's going on inside your head.,S02E16,102
"Trust me, sir,",S02E16,103
There's nothing going on in here at all.,S02E16,104
I'm gonna be watching you.,S02E16,105
"To make sure you treat Skyler right,",S02E16,106
That you're worthy of her.,S02E16,107
One more thing: I don't want her to know,S02E16,108
I've been checking up on you.,S02E16,109
"Well, what does she think you're doing right now?",S02E16,110
Using the bathroom.,S02E16,111
Is there anything else?,S02E16,112
Usually it takes me a while to use the bathroom.,S02E16,113
"-Hey, dad.",S02E16,114
-Hey.,S02E16,115
"Oh, dad, I think you dropped something.",S02E16,116
"Oh, hey, one of my scratchers.",S02E16,117
"Oh, hey, let's see.",S02E16,118
Maybe we've won.,S02E16,119
Seven.,S02E16,120
Another seven.,S02E16,121
Been here before.,S02E16,122
And the last number.,S02E16,123
What?,S02E16,124
"Look, it's a seven.",S02E16,125
It's a seven.,S02E16,126
-I won.,S02E16,127
I won.,S02E16,128
-How much did you win?.,S02E16,129
$1 million!,S02E16,130
Whoo-hoo!,S02E16,131
"Whoo! Whoo! I won, I won, I won!",S02E16,132
What is going on with dad?,S02E16,133
He thinks he won the lottery.,S02E16,134
"-Thinks? -Yeah, it's a prank.",S02E16,135
I bought one of those fake scratchers from the joke store.,S02E16,136
He fell for that?,S02E16,137
Whoo-hoo! I'm king of the world!,S02E16,138
He's gonna find out.,S02E16,139
"Yeah, and I'll be grounded for two weeks.",S02E16,140
"But, you know, I'll have been to super adventure land.",S02E16,141
It's worth it.,S02E16,142
I crunched the numbers.,S02E16,143
"I'm so happy, I don't know what to do with myself.",S02E16,144
"Well, yesterday you said if you ever win the lottery.",S02E16,145
You'd take me to super adventure land.,S02E16,146
"All right, let's go.",S02E16,147
Get in the car.,S02E16,148
"Oh, wait a minute.",S02E16,149
Wait a minute.,S02E16,150
We're millionaires.,S02E16,151
Forget the car.,S02E16,152
We're renting a limo.,S02E16,153
"Wait, dad.",S02E16,154
Okay.,S02E16,155
"Oh, thank you, Dr.",S02E16,156
Charlie.,S02E16,157
I'm all better now.,S02E16,158
Ow.,S02E16,159
Another shot.,S02E16,160
"No, I've already had seven shots.",S02E16,161
There's no more owies.,S02E16,162
Ow.,S02E16,163
Another shot.,S02E16,164
"Okay, I think I'm kind of over this.",S02E16,165
"Ivy, are you ready to go?",S02E16,166
Check out what I found in the bathroom,S02E16,167
Diamond earrings.,S02E16,168
Watch me work it.,S02E16,169
"Ivy, hey, take those off.",S02E16,170
Don't you know that Deedee's daddy's deputy Doug Dooley?,S02E16,171
Ivy Wentz rocking earrings.,S02E16,172
From the Dooley collection.,S02E16,173
"Seriously, take those off.",S02E16,174
"Yeah, they'll look better on you anyway.",S02E16,175
"No, we're here to babysit, not try on",S02E16,176
-Ooh.,S02E16,177
-Yeah.,S02E16,178
"Oh, these do look good.",S02E16,179
"Yep, strut your stuff, girl.",S02E16,180
-It's fun.,S02E16,181
"Go ahead, do it.",S02E16,182
-Okay.,S02E16,183
Ooh ooh ooh ooh.,S02E16,184
"Ow! Hey, who did that?",S02E16,185
-Ooh.,S02E16,186
Uh-oh.,S02E16,187
-What?.,S02E16,188
One of the doctors spilled a juice box.,S02E16,189
At least I hope it's juice.,S02E16,190
"All right, Ivy, why don't you take them outside?",S02E16,191
I'm gonna clean this up.,S02E16,192
And then we can go to make-a-monkey.,S02E16,193
"Okay, come on.",S02E16,194
"Come on, Deedee.",S02E16,195
Let's go bye-bye.,S02E16,196
Go with Ivy.,S02E16,197
-Let's go to make-a-monkey. -Yay!,S02E16,198
"Eww, and it's not juice.",S02E16,199
-Where are you going? -Whoa!,S02E16,200
What are you doing here?,S02E16,201
I told you I was gonna be watching you.,S02E16,202
Did you think I was a liar?,S02E16,203
"No, I just I thought you'd be watching me from a distance",S02E16,204
"You know, with, like, a telescope or binoculars or something.",S02E16,205
I did that for a while.,S02E16,206
I got bored.,S02E16,207
Now I asked you a question.,S02E16,208
Where are you going?,S02E16,209
"Uh, I'm going to the library to meet Skyler.",S02E16,210
Looking like that? You couldn't even comb your hair?,S02E16,211
I spent 20 minutes to get it like this.,S02E16,212
What are you doing?,S02E16,213
"Anytime you do something I do not like,",S02E16,214
I mark it down in the negative column.,S02E16,215
Is there a positive column too?,S02E16,216
Not yet.,S02E16,217
Okay.,S02E16,218
"Well, if you'll excuse me,",S02E16,219
"I'm gonna go back inside and comb my hair,",S02E16,220
But not because of anything you said,S02E16,221
Because I want to.,S02E16,222
Stupid.,S02E16,223
bad with doors.,S02E16,224
That was four hours of my life I'll never get back.,S02E16,225
I still have that theme song drilled into my head.,S02E16,226
First you pick a color brown or green or red,S02E16,227
Then you take some stuffing and put it in its head,S02E16,228
Then it goes on for 20 more verses and you wish you were dead,S02E16,229
And that's how you make a mo-oh-oh-oh-nkey.,S02E16,230
-Oh no. -What?,S02E16,231
The earrings you're still wearing them.,S02E16,232
-What? -Yes.,S02E16,233
"Oh! Ivy, Ivy, I just have one earring on.",S02E16,234
-The other one must have fallen off.,S02E16,235
-No.,S02E16,236
"Yes yes, I lost her diamond earring.",S02E16,237
What? Why did you even try them on?,S02E16,238
-What? That was your idea! -You know better than to listen to me.,S02E16,239
Okay okay okay okay.,S02E16,240
"All right, let's not panic.",S02E16,241
"I'll just okay, I'll check the car.",S02E16,242
You you call make-a-monkey and see if they found it.,S02E16,243
The important thing here is,S02E16,244
Is not to panic.,S02E16,245
-Not in the car.,S02E16,246
-Not at the place.,S02E16,247
"Okay, time to panic. Oh!",S02E16,248
Calm down.,S02E16,249
Ivy's got a plan.,S02E16,250
"Oh, Ivy's got a plan.",S02E16,251
"-Look, I think I know where the earring is. -Where?",S02E16,252
Check it out.,S02E16,253
I took some pictures at make-a-monkey.,S02E16,254
Here you are at the stuffing machine two earrings.,S02E16,255
"Oh oh, here I am after the stuffing machine one earring.",S02E16,256
"Yes, so the missing earring is",S02E16,257
Inside a monkey.,S02E16,258
"Hi, Charlie. What you got there?",S02E16,259
Monkey.,S02E16,260
Can I see it?,S02E16,261
-Get that monkey.,S02E16,262
-Mm-hmm.,S02E16,263
"Man, that sister of yours.",S02E16,264
Can put up quite a fight.,S02E16,265
I know.,S02E16,266
We'd be better off if we fought an actual monkey.,S02E16,267
She sure does love that thing.,S02E16,268
Yeah.,S02E16,269
"Yeah, she sure does.",S02E16,270
Now let's rip it apart.,S02E16,271
It's not in here.,S02E16,272
"Oh, this is bad.",S02E16,273
This is really bad.,S02E16,274
"T, calm down.",S02E16,275
"If the earring isn't in this monkey,",S02E16,276
It has to be in the other monkey.,S02E16,277
"Right right right right, Deedee's monkey",S02E16,278
That's in the police chief's house.,S02E16,279
Is that calm enough for you?,S02E16,280
"Man, super adventure land was amazing.",S02E16,281
It sure is.,S02E16,282
"Hey hey, give me the picture of the log ride again.",S02E16,283
"-Ah, look at your face.",S02E16,284
-Look at your face.,S02E16,285
Look at the limo driver's face.,S02E16,286
"Okay, dad, now that we've had our fun,",S02E16,287
There's something I gotta tell you.,S02E16,288
And maybe you should sit down.,S02E16,289
"Hey, kids, how do you like mama's new ride?",S02E16,290
"Hey, look at you.",S02E16,291
Where did you get that?,S02E16,292
At the mall.,S02E16,293
"Yeah, I did a little shopping.",S02E16,294
After your dad told me we won the lottery.,S02E16,295
"You can return that, right?",S02E16,296
"Nope, forever rich has a no-return policy.",S02E16,297
But who cares?,S02E16,298
Not me.,S02E16,299
Nothing bothers a millionaire.,S02E16,300
Nothing bothers a millionaire.,S02E16,301
-Whoo-hoo! -Whoo!,S02E16,302
You guys didn't really win the lottery.,S02E16,303
It was just a prank so I could go to super adventure land.,S02E16,304
That's really funny.,S02E16,305
So why aren't you laughing?,S02E16,306
I'm really sorry.,S02E16,307
I never meant for it to go this far.,S02E16,308
"Now I know you're probably gonna ground me for, like, two weeks,",S02E16,309
"But under the circumstances,",S02E16,310
I'm fine with three.,S02E16,311
I quit my job today.,S02E16,312
What?,S02E16,313
"You can get it back, right?",S02E16,314
Uh,S02E16,315
What? What? We won? I can't believe it.,S02E16,316
"I'll tell you what I can't believe, Duncan",S02E16,317
It's that you're taking another personal call.,S02E16,318
Now I asked you to do something.,S02E16,319
With these bags of saline a half an hour ago.,S02E16,320
"Uh, gotta go.",S02E16,321
"You know what, Karen? You're absolutely right.",S02E16,322
I should have done something with these saline bags.,S02E16,323
A long time ago.,S02E16,324
"I mean, this is really overdue.",S02E16,325
-Oh! Oh! -Yeah yeah.,S02E16,326
Yeah yeah.,S02E16,327
Hi.,S02E16,328
Take me to easy street.,S02E16,329
"So long, suckers.",S02E16,330
How could you do that?,S02E16,331
Because I was a millionaire.,S02E16,332
Rich people play by different rules.,S02E16,333
I'm so sorry.,S02E16,334
"Dad, are you okay?",S02E16,335
He's hugging the kettle corn.,S02E16,336
This is all I have left.,S02E16,337
"Oh, the old orange peel smile always cracks me up.",S02E16,338
I tried it once with a pineapple not as fun.,S02E16,339
I gotta go rinse.,S02E16,340
I can't stand the feel of pulp on my teeth.,S02E16,341
I love learning new things about you.,S02E16,342
-Is everything okay? -Everything's great.,S02E16,343
"-Really? -Really, yeah.",S02E16,344
Everything couldn't be better.,S02E16,345
You're acting kind of weird.,S02E16,346
"I'm not acting weird, no.",S02E16,347
"If anything, I'm acting not weird.",S02E16,348
-Why does this always happen? -What?,S02E16,349
I date a guy for a while.,S02E16,350
And then all of a sudden he starts acting all strange.,S02E16,351
Then what happens?,S02E16,352
Then he just kind of disappears.,S02E16,353
"Hey, mom, what are you doing?",S02E16,354
Hey.,S02E16,355
A couple things.,S02E16,356
Trying to find a new job.,S02E16,357
And researching military schools for Gabe.,S02E16,358
"Wow, that sounds stressful.",S02E16,359
"Hey, you know, you should go to the gym,",S02E16,360
"Maybe maybe with a workout buddy,",S02E16,361
Somebody like Debbie Dooley.,S02E16,362
She's fun.,S02E16,363
"Teddy, I know what you're trying to do.",S02E16,364
"Mm-hmm, you want back into Debbie Dooley's house,",S02E16,365
And I know why.,S02E16,366
-You do? -Yep.,S02E16,367
You want another babysitting gig.,S02E16,368
Am I that transparent?,S02E16,369
"Charlie, what happened to your monkey?",S02E16,370
I don't know.,S02E16,371
$62 for this?,S02E16,372
The head's not even facing the right way.,S02E16,373
That's the way she wanted it.,S02E16,374
"Excuse me, are you Karen?",S02E16,375
Yeah. Why?,S02E16,376
"I'm Gabe, Amy Duncan's son.",S02E16,377
"Look, the reason my mom quit was all my fault.",S02E16,378
I played a really mean prank on my parents.,S02E16,379
And it got way out of hand.,S02E16,380
"Now that you know the truth, can you please give her her job back?",S02E16,381
"Oh, well,",S02E16,382
"If it means that much to you,",S02E16,383
No!,S02E16,384
Ha! I gotcha!,S02E16,385
"Oh, you should see your face.",S02E16,386
"I really had you going there, didn't I?",S02E16,387
Oh good.,S02E16,388
"Good for you, Karen.",S02E16,389
Okay.,S02E16,390
"Excuse me,",S02E16,391
Do you know whose lottery ticket this is?,S02E16,392
Yes.,S02E16,393
It's mine.,S02E16,394
I won! I won!,S02E16,395
"I won, I won, I won, I won!",S02E16,396
Hey hey hey!,S02E16,397
I've always loved you.,S02E16,398
Hi.,S02E16,399
May I? Oh.,S02E16,400
How much longer are you gonna follow me around?,S02E16,401
Till I find out the kind of guy you are.,S02E16,402
Now I'm a guy who's about to restock the cups.,S02E16,403
bad with cups.,S02E16,404
"Look, I only messed up cause you made me nervous.",S02E16,405
Thanks.,S02E16,406
-Got all I need. -For what?,S02E16,407
To tell Skyler you're not the guy.,S02E16,408
See ya.,S02E16,409
No no.,S02E16,410
Stop.,S02E16,411
I am the guy.,S02E16,412
Skyler is the best thing that's ever happened to me.,S02E16,413
"And I'm not going away, no matter what.",S02E16,414
So put that in your little notebook.,S02E16,415
"Oh, and number 12, your order's ready.",S02E16,416
Number 12.,S02E16,417
Uh-oh. Is this the part where you make me disappear?,S02E16,418
"Relax, kid.",S02E16,419
You stuck up for yourself.,S02E16,420
That's what I wanted to hear.,S02E16,421
So it's okay if I date your daughter?,S02E16,422
"Oh, she's not my daughter.",S02E16,423
She's his daughter.,S02E16,424
He always hires me to check out the boyfriends.,S02E16,425
"With that elfin smile, people don't take him too seriously.",S02E16,426
Deedee was so excited that Teddy was back.,S02E16,427
That daughter of yours is quite something.,S02E16,428
"Yeah, I make some good daughters.",S02E16,429
Bob makes the boys.,S02E16,430
Yesterday it was just so good.,S02E16,431
To watch deedee have fun with Teddy.,S02E16,432
"-What do you mean, watch? -Oh, well,",S02E16,433
My husband insisted we put in a nanny-cam.,S02E16,434
"Oh, a nanny-cam? I've never seen one of those.",S02E16,435
"If you have a laptop, I'll show you right now.",S02E16,436
"I do, right behind you.",S02E16,437
Let's look.,S02E16,438
Oh good.,S02E16,439
"Oh, there they are.",S02E16,440
Your daughter has a real gift.,S02E16,441
It takes me forever to put deedee down.,S02E16,442
"Well, that's a little peculiar.",S02E16,443
This doesn't seem right.,S02E16,444
"Oh my goodness, she's murdering the monkey.",S02E16,445
-Oh.,S02E16,446
-Oh.,S02E16,447
Really?,S02E16,448
One neighbor I just want to be friends with one neighbor.,S02E16,449
"Hey, Charlie.",S02E16,450
"So I learned a very important life lesson today,",S02E16,451
And that is never wear.,S02E16,452
"A pair of accidentally make-a-monkey,",S02E16,453
"Because if you do,your neighbor might said something like",S02E16,454
"oh my goodness,",S02E16,455
That girl's just not right in the head.,S02E16,456
"Hi, Charlie.",S02E16,457
"Oh, and mom's back at work.",S02E16,458
"Actually her boss quit for some unknown reason,",S02E16,459
And so she got a promotion.,S02E16,460
Which is why daddy gets one of these too.,S02E16,461
"Bob, watch where you are going.",S02E16,462
Ahh!,S02E16,463
Oh.,S02E16,464
"Yeah, in a couple of years,",S02E16,465
"When all of us kids have left the house,",S02E16,466
They'll be all yours.,S02E16,467
"Good luck, Charlie.",S02E16,468
"Hey, what happened to you?",S02E16,469
Isn't it obvious? My head's on backwards.,S02E16,470
"Yeah, I didn't want to say anything.",S02E16,471
"Doctor, the patients are prepped and ready for surgery.",S02E16,472
She look a little young to you?,S02E16,473
I'm sure she's highly trained.,S02E16,474
You can go first.,S02E16,475
You will not believe the conversation,S02E17,0
I just overheard between Gabe and his friend Jake.,S02E17,1
So you were snooping.,S02E17,2
I wasn't snooping.,S02E17,3
I was tiptoeing down the stairs.,S02E17,4
When I paused for a break.,S02E17,5
"Aha, go on, snoopy.",S02E17,6
"Okay, so anyway,",S02E17,7
"Gabe says, Heather is so hot.",S02E17,8
"And Jake's all, so hot!",S02E17,9
"And then Gabe says, I really like her,",S02E17,10
But I'm too nervous to talk to her.,S02E17,11
"And Jake's all, dude, you gotta hike up your skirt.",S02E17,12
And ask her out.,S02E17,13
"Bob, what are we gonna do about this?",S02E17,14
How about we make you wear a bell so the kids can hear you coming?,S02E17,15
I'm talking about Gabe being too shy to talk to girls.,S02E17,16
"Once again, mama ames has to solve the problem.",S02E17,17
"Ooh, snooping and meddling.",S02E17,18
Mama ames is on fire today.,S02E17,19
You know what? I think I got a bell in the garage.,S02E17,20
"What you got there, kiddo?",S02E17,21
I'm just going through my old school photos.,S02E17,22
We're getting our pictures taken in a couple of days.,S02E17,23
And I am determined for once to not look like a dork.,S02E17,24
What's wrong with your pictures?,S02E17,25
"Well, let's stroll down memory lane, shall we?",S02E17,26
Here I am in kindergarten.,S02E17,27
"Yeah, that was the day we learned about static electricity.",S02E17,28
I just finished rubbing my head with a balloon.,S02E17,29
"Well, honey, they can't all be that bad.",S02E17,30
"Oh, can't they? Here I am again, third grade.",S02E17,31
That was the morning that baby Gabe threw a sippy cup at me.,S02E17,32
Baby Gabe such a little terror.,S02E17,33
-And we thought it was just a phase.,S02E17,34
-Yeah.,S02E17,35

"But first, I wanna picture of you and me.",S02E17,63
Can it wait till tomorrow?,S02E17,64
It'll give me a chance to trim my beard.,S02E17,65
Beard? I don't see anything.,S02E17,66
"Really? I've been growing it out for, like, a month.",S02E17,67
"Well, I really need a picture now.",S02E17,68
"All right. Well, nobody else is home,",S02E17,69

"Okay, Charlie, come here for a second.",S02E17,71
This is very easy.,S02E17,72
"Very easy, okay.",S02E17,73
You're gonna push this little button halfway down to focus.,S02E17,74

"Hey, those shades are tight.",S02E17,110
So you just you stand here.,S02E17,111
And you act dumb?,S02E17,112

"Well, I get a huge discount on all the clothes.",S02E17,114
"Oh, I want a stupid job too.",S02E17,115

"But since you're not a big reader,",S02E17,128
I taped it for you instead.,S02E17,129
There's a boom box on the bench.,S02E17,130
Hit play.,S02E17,131
So this is kind of hard.,S02E17,132
I have to tell you that,S02E17,133
I'm sorry.,S02E17,134

Which means I'm moving there.,S02E17,139
"I wanted to tell you, but it made me so sad to say goodbye,",S02E17,140
I just couldn't.,S02E17,141

"No, we are never having that conversation.",S02E17,174
"Gabe, I'm a girl.",S02E17,175
I know what girls like.,S02E17,176
"Honey, I just want you to have the right information.",S02E17,177
"Mom, if I need information about girls,",S02E17,178
I'll get it where all 12-year-olds get it:,S02E17,179
From a 13-year-old.,S02E17,180
How cute.,S02E17,181
He thinks this is over.,S02E17,182
"Okay, just remember, try and be",S02E17,183

Cool.,S02E17,203
"Okay, let's see how you do with a beach ball.",S02E17,204
"Yeah, you're just gonna wanna okay.",S02E17,205
What was that?,S02E17,206

You have to make me believe that you love catching beach balls.,S02E17,208
"-Okay okay, all right.",S02E17,209
-Yeah.,S02E17,210
Again.,S02E17,211
It's fun.,S02E17,212
I think you could be hot teen summer material,S02E17,213
"Awesome, stoked.",S02E17,214
If you do something about that pale skin.,S02E17,215
"Sorry, what?",S02E17,216
You have to look like you live in the sun.,S02E17,217
At H.,S02E17,218
T.,S02E17,219
S.,S02E17,220
-The sun is your daddy.,S02E17,221

Would you keep your voice down? Do you wanna get us all fired?,S02E17,235
-Oh sorry. -Shh!,S02E17,236
"Hey, look what I found on the porch.",S02E17,237
"dear Duncan family,",S02E17,238
"I wrote you this note, then decided you should hear it from me instead.",S02E17,239
Press play.',S02E17,240
"Hey, guys,",S02E17,241
So I decided to follow Skyler to New York so we can be together.,S02E17,242
Skyler's parents said I could stay with them,S02E17,243
Until I land on my feet.,S02E17,244
So Thanks for being a great family,S02E17,245

"Oh, by the way, this is P.",S02E17,248

"Hey, Charlie, it's daddy.",S02E17,252
I'm calling you from New York City.,S02E17,253
Can you put mommy on the phone?,S02E17,254

Or just hang up.,S02E17,257
Pizza's here!,S02E17,258

It's P.,S02E17,260
J.,S02E17,261
's dad.,S02E17,262
"Oh, this is awkward.",S02E17,263
We only ordered a medium.,S02E17,264
"Actually, I'm just looking for P.",S02E17,265
J.,S02E17,266
"Oh, P.",S02E17,267
J.,S02E17,268
Can you believe he came all this way for me?,S02E17,269
-It's so romantic.,S02E17,270
-Ah.,S02E17,271
So did you see a pizza delivery guy on your way up?,S02E17,272
So where is he?,S02E17,273
I don't know.,S02E17,274

"Yeah, he wants to make money to get his own apartment.",S02E17,283
He's working on wall street.,S02E17,284
He's working on wall street?,S02E17,285
"Well, under wall street.",S02E17,286
they say new yorkers can be kind of rude,S02E17,287
why not give money to this Denver dude?,S02E17,288
a few coins or dollars sure wouldn't spoil it,S02E17,289
why am I singing in what smells like a toilet? .,S02E17,290
Okay.,S02E17,291
All right.,S02E17,292
keep bronzer on for one hour.,S02E17,293
Then rinse and enjoy your golden tan.,S02E17,294
Sounds simple enough.,S02E17,295
"Okay, so",S02E17,296
One hour.,S02E17,297
Now I just have to wait for the ding.,S02E17,298
What time is it?,S02E17,299
3:00.,S02E17,300
"By the way, you're orange.",S02E17,301
"Yeah, I know I'm orange.",S02E17,302
Why didn't the timer go off?,S02E17,303
"Charlie, what did you do?",S02E17,304
"Relax, someday you'll laugh about this.",S02E17,305
I'm gonna laugh about it today.,S02E17,306
"Oh my gosh, I can't believe I, Heather grouper,",S02E17,307
Am in Gabe Duncan's house.,S02E17,308
I didn't think he even knew I existed.,S02E17,309
"Well, obviously I exist.",S02E17,310
"Or I wouldn't be here in Gabe Duncan's house,",S02E17,311
Which is so much bigger than I thought.,S02E17,312
Isn't it so funny how some houses.,S02E17,313
"Look so small from the outside, but are big on the inside?",S02E17,314
"And other houses look big on the outside,",S02E17,315
But are small on the inside?,S02E17,316
"Well, anyway, what was the question again?",S02E17,317
How are you?,S02E17,318
"Good. Great actually,",S02E17,319
Because I'm in Gabe Duncan's house!,S02E17,320
"Yeah, we got that.",S02E17,321
We got that.,S02E17,322
Gabe!,S02E17,323
What are you doing here?,S02E17,324
Your mom invited me.,S02E17,325
She said you like me.,S02E17,326
"Mom, a word in the kitchen?",S02E17,327
Okay.,S02E17,328
Be right back.,S02E17,329
Why did you tell annoying Heather I like her?,S02E17,330
Because I know my little boy is too shy,S02E17,331
I'm sorry.,S02E17,332
Why did you call her annoying Heather?,S02E17,333
I don't like her.,S02E17,334
I like hot Heather.,S02E17,335
There's two heathers?,S02E17,336
In my class there are five heathers.,S02E17,337
And I would have been okay with any of the others,S02E17,338
"Smart Heather, tall Heather,",S02E17,339
Even hairy Heather.,S02E17,340
"Boy, I'm really starting.",S02E17,341
To wish you hadn't gotten me involved in this.,S02E17,342
"I'm tired and hungry, so don't be so selfish",S02E17,343
anything helps,S02E17,344
but I'm allergic to shellfish.,S02E17,345
.,S02E17,346
"Hey! Dad, what are you doing here?",S02E17,347
We need to talk.,S02E17,348
Hey hey hey hey!,S02E17,349
"Hey, get lost, mimey.",S02E17,350
This is my territory.,S02E17,351
"Go on, hit the imaginary road.",S02E17,352
-Get outta here.,S02E17,353
"-Whoa whoa whoa, P.",S02E17,354
J.,S02E17,355
!.,S02E17,356
-What happened to you? -Been in New York a day and a half.,S02E17,357
"The city changes you, man.",S02E17,358
"Okay, you need to come home.",S02E17,359
"No no, Skyler and I belong together.",S02E17,360
"I know how you feel,",S02E17,361
But look at the size of that cockroach.,S02E17,362
Skyler is the best thing that's ever happened to me.,S02E17,363
We're meant to be together.,S02E17,364
P.,S02E17,365
J.,S02E17,366
", you're 17 years old.",S02E17,367
How can you possibly know that?,S02E17,368
"Well, all I know is I don't wanna be apart from her.",S02E17,369
You might not be apart forever.,S02E17,370
"-What do you mean? -When it comes to love, there's a very old saying",S02E17,371
"Sweet mama, that's a giant rat!",S02E17,372
"Yeah, I've heard that before, but",S02E17,373
"No no no, that's that's not the saying.",S02E17,374
The saying is,S02E17,375
"Son, if you love something, set it free.",S02E17,376
"If it comes back to you, then it's yours.",S02E17,377
"But if it doesn't, then it never was.",S02E17,378
What happened to you?,S02E17,379
I may have overbronzed just a smidge.,S02E17,380
"I didn't think you'd pull off the whole dumb thing,",S02E17,381
But it turns out you're a natural.,S02E17,382
"-Teddy? -Oh hi, boss.",S02E17,383
"Hey, why don't you toss me that beach ball, dude?",S02E17,384
Whoo! Yeah!,S02E17,385
Why are you orange?,S02E17,386
"See, it's just a healthy glow.",S02E17,387
"Hey, brother, why don't you throw me that football?",S02E17,388
Oh!,S02E17,389
-Ow. -Are you okay?,S02E17,390
"Yeah, I'm good.",S02E17,391
I'm fine.,S02E17,392
"Hey, righteous beach towel, dude.",S02E17,393
Could I use it to wipe up some blood?,S02E17,394
"Mom, what are we gonna do?",S02E17,395
We can't hide in the kitchen forever.,S02E17,396
Why not? We've got food.,S02E17,397
We've got drink.,S02E17,398
"Mom, you gotta get rid of her.",S02E17,399
This is really hard.,S02E17,400
I've never broken up with a girl before.,S02E17,401
"-Fine, I'll do it myself.",S02E17,402
"-Gabe, no.",S02E17,403
"Heather, I gotta tell you something.",S02E17,404
"Yes, Gabe?",S02E17,405
"Mom, something you wanna say?",S02E17,406
Okay.,S02E17,407
"Heather, the thing is.",S02E17,408
"Um, there was a little mix-up about the who likes who thing.",S02E17,409
Oh no! Gabe doesn't like me?,S02E17,410
Only because,S02E17,411
Jake likes you.,S02E17,412
Which Jake?,S02E17,413
How many are there?,S02E17,414
"Four. There's short Jake, skinny Jake, tall Jake",S02E17,415
This one's stocky with red hair.,S02E17,416
Hot Jake?,S02E17,417
Standards for the Jakes are really low.,S02E17,418
I can't believe Jake likes me. He's the total package,S02E17,419
"The red hair, the freckles, the way he always smells like bananas,",S02E17,420
"Which in case you didn't know, are the only fruits in the world",S02E17,421
Bye-bye now.,S02E17,422
Bye-bye.,S02E17,423
So even though you won't find another guy.,S02E17,424
Who's as crazy about you as I am,S02E17,425
I set you free.,S02E17,426
And even though.,S02E17,427
You'll never find a girl who's crazier than I am About you,S02E17,428
You're free too.,S02E17,429
So I guess this is it?,S02E17,430
"See, this is exactly why I didn't want to say goodbye to you.",S02E17,431
"Hey, let's not say goodbye then.",S02E17,432
Let's just say.,S02E17,433
See you later.,S02E17,434
Hey.,S02E17,435
"It'll be okay, son.",S02E17,436
"Hey, would you watch it?",S02E17,437
"I'm having a conversation here, you jerk!",S02E17,438
Dad?,S02E17,439
"Wow, this city really does change you.",S02E17,440
Let's get out of here.,S02E17,441
"Well, Charlie, dad brought P.",S02E17,442
J.,S02E17,443
back home.,S02E17,444
And now he's showing mom the pictures he took in New York.,S02E17,445
It's just bugs and rats.,S02E17,446
"I know, right?",S02E17,447

"Congratulations, mom.",S02E18,0
"Oh, thank you, sweetheart.",S02E18,1
I was wondering if you kids would remember.,S02E18,2
"Well, who could forget a day like this?",S02E18,3
Any idea what we're talking about?,S02E18,4
It's our 20th wedding anniversary.,S02E18,5
"Wow, 20 years with dad.",S02E18,6
"Wow, that's a real conversation stopper, isn't it?",S02E18,7
"Okay, kids, your dad and I have had 20 wonderful years.",S02E18,8
"I gotta give the guy credit. I mean, let's face it",S02E18,9
Sometimes I may not be the easiest person in the world to live with.,S02E18,10
This is where you all jump in.,S02E18,11
"And say, no no no, mom.",S02E18,12
You're great.,S02E18,13
"No no no, mom.",S02E18,14
You're great.,S02E18,15
So is dad gonna get you a nice gift?,S02E18,16
"Kids, I love your father dearly,",S02E18,17
"But when it comes to anniversary gifts,",S02E18,18
There's only one word to describe him.,S02E18,19
It starts with ch and ends in eap.,S02E18,20
"Yeah, I'm gonna need more hints.",S02E18,21
"Yeah, the only gift he ever gets me is a card he signs,",S02E18,22
happy anniversary.,S02E18,23
"Love, me.",S02E18,24
"Well, at least you get a card.",S02E18,25

He reuses it every year.,S02E18,27
"Well, who knows? Maybe this year he'll surprise you.",S02E18,28
"Yeah, maybe he'll come into the kitchen with his zipper up.",S02E18,29
"-Good morning, everybody.",S02E18,30
"-Dad, barn door.",S02E18,31
"For you, my dear.",S02E18,32

You are so generous.,S02E18,48
"Oh, thank you.",S02E18,49

Today's all burnt toast ,S02E18,51
"Running late, and dad jokes",S02E18,52
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S02E18,53
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S02E18,54

"Hang in there, baby.",S02E18,68
"Bob, this place is gorgeous.",S02E18,69
"Huh? Only the best for you, my love.",S02E18,70
-Oh.,S02E18,71
"-Okay, I'm gonna check us in.",S02E18,72
Okay.,S02E18,73
"-Hey, Charlie, you wanna find a pool? -Yeah",S02E18,74

"Okay, guys, come on, you don't have to wait for me.",S02E18,76
"Go outside, explore.",S02E18,77
We're in paradise.,S02E18,78
"Dude, look at the size of that flat-screen.",S02E18,79
"Teddy, you don't have to hang with me.",S02E18,80
"Come on, there's got to be to check out too.",S02E18,81
"No, that's okay. I",S02E18,82

"-Hi, um, I'm Teddy.",S02E18,84
"-Aloha, Teddy.",S02E18,85

Kai what an interesting name.,S02E18,87
It means the sea. what does teddy mean?,S02E18,88
"Oh, it means my parents were expecting a boy.",S02E18,89
So are you into surfing?,S02E18,90
Am I? I have been complaining about.,S02E18,91
The lack of surf in Denver since I don't know when.,S02E18,92
"If you want a surfing lesson, I'll be at the beach tomorrow morning.",S02E18,93
"Yeah, I'd love that.",S02E18,94
"Okay well, aloha.",S02E18,95
"That means hello, goodbye and I like your smile.",S02E18,96
Actually just the first two.,S02E18,97
Yeah.,S02E18,98
"No, I know.",S02E18,99
I was going for an alo-ha-ha.,S02E18,100
I'm leaving now.,S02E18,101
"Hi, I'd like to check in.",S02E18,102
The name is Bob Duncan.,S02E18,103
I believe we have the sizzlin' summer package.,S02E18,104
"Yes, here it is one room,",S02E18,105
And I see you will be attending the timeshare presentation.,S02E18,106
-Hey. -Hey! How much did you hear?,S02E18,107
"Oh, not much, just something about a timeshare. What is that?",S02E18,108
It's you know what it is?,S02E18,109
It's complicated. Why don't,S02E18,110
Timeshare is a hotel room you buy one week every year.,S02E18,111
"-For the rest of your life. -Okay, she doesn't",S02E18,112
"For attending our presentation,",S02E18,113
Mr.,S02E18,114
Duncan gets his entire trip for free.,S02E18,115
 Need to know all that.,S02E18,116
So,S02E18,117
Your big anniversary gift to mom is a free trip?,S02E18,118
This is a win-win.,S02E18,119
Your mom thinks I'm a hero and I've got,S02E18,120
I've got no intention of buying a timeshare.,S02E18,121
Come on.,S02E18,122
Can't we keep this between us?,S02E18,123
Keep what between us?,S02E18,124
That's why you're my favorite.,S02E18,125
Yeah.,S02E18,126
And here's our room!,S02E18,127
I love it!,S02E18,128
"Oh, this is sweet. Where's our room?",S02E18,129
"Uh, it's a computer glitch.",S02E18,130
They messed up our reservation.,S02E18,131
Sounds believable to me.,S02E18,132
"Wait, we're all staying in one room?",S02E18,133
"Oh come on, you guys, this is gonna be great. Look at this",S02E18,134
We even have a view of what appears to be.,S02E18,135
The parking lot of a golf course.,S02E18,136
I don't want to share a room with you people.,S02E18,137
"Okay, you two stop it.",S02E18,138
Your very generous father.,S02E18,139
Spent a lot of money to get us here.,S02E18,140
Sounds believable too.,S02E18,141
Where are we all gonna sleep?,S02E18,142
"It's simple girls in one bed, guys in the other.",S02E18,143
"Oh, that is not fair.",S02E18,144
We have dad.,S02E18,145
"Yeah, but Charlie is a very restless sleeper.",S02E18,146
But we have dad.,S02E18,147
Would you relax? We're gonna make this work.,S02E18,148
"Hey, Charlie, here we are in Hawaii.",S02E18,149
I'm in my bed; Mom's in my bed;,S02E18,150
You're in my bed.,S02E18,151
But we still have the good bed because,S02E18,152
"Dad, can you scoot over?",S02E18,153
-Sorry. -Ah!,S02E18,154
That's better.,S02E18,155
"Wish them good luck, Charlie.",S02E18,156
That wasn't so bad.,S02E18,157
Speak for yourself.,S02E18,158
"If Charlie Duncan sinks this putt,",S02E18,159
She wins a free trip to the kahuna kiddies' club.,S02E18,160
While mommy gets a full-body massage.,S02E18,161
And she wins the trip anyway!,S02E18,162
"-I'm sorry, you can't go in there. -Why not?",S02E18,163
-Because it is kapu. - Kapu?,S02E18,164
It means forbidden.,S02E18,165
that is sacred ground.,S02E18,166
Sacred ground? Next to the towel hut?,S02E18,167
I don't think so.,S02E18,168
"Stop! If you go in there,",S02E18,169
Bad things will happen.,S02E18,170
"Listen, buddy, I have four kids.",S02E18,171
And I'm married to an exterminator.,S02E18,172
That's about as kapu as it gets.,S02E18,173
-What are you doing? -Putting a curse on you.,S02E18,174
Oh really?,S02E18,175
"Well, if I were cursed, could I do this?",S02E18,176
Now your whole family is cursed.,S02E18,177
"Ooh, my whole family!",S02E18,178
Got any pets? cause we could do this all day.,S02E18,179
I'll tell you what you do this all day.,S02E18,180
And I'm gonna enjoy my vacation.,S02E18,181
"Ah, there it is.",S02E18,182
"Ha, cursed.",S02E18,183
Plea,S02E18,184
I used the fast-acting curse.,S02E18,185
"Guys, come on.",S02E18,186
We're in Hawaii.,S02E18,187
You can't sit in a room all day playing video games.,S02E18,188
We could if you'd leave us alone.,S02E18,189
What could you possibly be playing.,S02E18,190
That could be better than exploring Hawaii?,S02E18,191
It's a really cool game called tropical chopper challenge.,S02E18,192
"Yeah, right now we're flying helicopters over volcanoes.",S02E18,193
You can do that for real on the island.,S02E18,194
"Yeah, but are the graphics this good?",S02E18,195
-Let's see.,S02E18,196
-Check it out.,S02E18,197
Oh! Oh yeah.,S02E18,198
"Come on, guys, let's go.",S02E18,199
"Come on, I'm gonna drop you off at the helicopter.",S02E18,200
You're gonna have the time of your lives.,S02E18,201
Look at this I even got a coupon.,S02E18,202
hal's discount helicopter:,S02E18,203
Serving the island since February.,S02E18,204
Let's go.,S02E18,205
"Hey, Gabe, in the car do you want to play snorkeling adventure?",S02E18,206
Unless they have that in Hawaii too.,S02E18,207
"Hi, kai.",S02E18,208
"Oh, that rhymed.",S02E18,209
So am I the only one here?,S02E18,210
Is this gonna be a private lesson?,S02E18,211
Unless someone else shows up.,S02E18,212
Let me get you a board.,S02E18,213
"All right. Later, gator!",S02E18,214
Too much.,S02E18,215
Is this where the surfing lessons are?,S02E18,216
"Uh, yeah. You're interested in surfing?",S02E18,217
"Well, at home I love channel surfing,",S02E18,218
So I thought I'd try the other kind.,S02E18,219
"Well, you might have a hard time with this class.",S02E18,220
The teacher doesn't speak any English whatsoever.,S02E18,221
"I'll be right with you, Teddy.",S02E18,222
"Wow, he's gotten better.",S02E18,223
Is that the surfing instructor?,S02E18,224
-Uh-huh. -And you want to be alone with him?,S02E18,225
-Uh-huh. -Why didn't you just say so?,S02E18,226
Hawaii is for romance.,S02E18,227
I'll find somewhere else to avoid my husband.,S02E18,228
Thank you.,S02E18,229
-Bye.,S02E18,230
-Bye.,S02E18,231
-Who was that? -I don't know.,S02E18,232
She didn't speak any English.,S02E18,233
"Oh, Mr.",S02E18,234
Duncan? Just want to remind you.,S02E18,235
The timeshare presentation is today at 3:00.,S02E18,236
"Yes yes. By the way, how long is the presentation?",S02E18,237
6 and a half hours,S02E18,238
Wo wow.,S02E18,239
Why why so long?,S02E18,240
It takes a while to break people down.,S02E18,241
"I mean, we have a lot of ground to cover.",S02E18,242
Okay. See you then,S02E18,243
Or not.,S02E18,244
"-Hey, honey.",S02E18,245
-Hey.,S02E18,246
"-Who was that? -Uh, him?",S02E18,247
Uh Director of ping-pong services.,S02E18,248
Do you want to meet me by the pool?,S02E18,249
"Yeah yeah, let me grab my suit.",S02E18,250
And then I'll tell you about my curse.,S02E18,251
Your what?,S02E18,252
Cute story.,S02E18,253
You're gonna laugh.,S02E18,254
All right.,S02E18,255
"Oh, I am so glad you're here.",S02E18,256
Thank you. Do I know you?,S02E18,257
I happen to have a deathly fear of elevators.,S02E18,258
I hate riding in them alone.,S02E18,259
"Well, now you have an elevator buddy.",S02E18,260
-You okay? -Fine so far.,S02E18,261
"But believe me, if this thing ever broke down,",S02E18,262
You would not want to be in here with me.,S02E18,263
"Don't worry, nothing's going to happen.",S02E18,264
-What's going on? -We stopped.,S02E18,265
You lied to me!,S02E18,266
Wha,S02E18,267
"No no no, calm down.",S02E18,268
I'm sure we'll start up again in a second.,S02E18,269
"-Ah, hold me! -Oh!",S02E18,270
"Um, okay, why don't we use the emergency phone to call someone?",S02E18,271
"Okay? Okay, we'll go together.",S02E18,272
Ready? Go.,S02E18,273
"Okay, look, just relax.",S02E18,274
We're going to be fine.,S02E18,275
As long as we don't lose power.,S02E18,276
"First time in a helicopter, boys?",S02E18,277
-Yep.,S02E18,278
-Mine too.,S02E18,279
Ha! A little helicopter humor.,S02E18,280
"Hey, what's that over there?",S02E18,281
No idea.,S02E18,282
Just moved here.,S02E18,283
Flew tours over the grand canyon for 30 years.,S02E18,284
What's the name of that volcano?,S02E18,285
Beats me.,S02E18,286
But did you know that the grand canyon's also a mile deep?,S02E18,287
"Yeah, I didn't, but school's out.",S02E18,288
So I'm not supposed to be learning anything new.,S02E18,289
Do you know anything about Hawaii?,S02E18,290
I know they got some weird food.,S02E18,291
I had some crazy fish today.,S02E18,292
It's not sitting too well.,S02E18,293
Either of you guys know how to fly one of these things?,S02E18,294
"Oh, is that more helicopter humor?",S02E18,295
Afraid not. I feel like I'm gonna,S02E18,296
-P.,S02E18,297
J.,S02E18,298
", do something.",S02E18,299
-I am.,S02E18,300
"Wake up, old dude! Wake up!",S02E18,301
P.,S02E18,302
J.,S02E18,303
", what are we going to do?.",S02E18,304
"Words, P.",S02E18,305
J.,S02E18,306
! Words!.,S02E18,307
Oh.,S02E18,308
"Well, maybe I could fly this thing.",S02E18,309
These controls kind of look like my video game.,S02E18,310
Where the heck is the zombie cannon?,S02E18,311
"Please, God, if you let me live through this,",S02E18,312
I promise I'll do something good.,S02E18,313
Another way to see the grand canyon is by burro.,S02E18,314
"Wow, you work fast.",S02E18,315
"All right, good, steady.",S02E18,316
Think you got it now? Can I let go?,S02E18,317
"No no, not quite yet.",S02E18,318
"Okay, so I think we've done enough balance.",S02E18,319
How about some board control?,S02E18,320
"Oh, surfing surfing surfing.",S02E18,321
"That is why we're here, right?",S02E18,322
"Yeah, but I thought maybe we could get to know each other.",S02E18,323
"Okay, I'll go first.",S02E18,324
"I love smoothies,",S02E18,325
"Um, you know, especially after a workout.",S02E18,326
Or or like a lesson of some kind.,S02E18,327
"Well, after the lesson's done,",S02E18,328
Do you want to get a smoothie?,S02E18,329
Look at you always one step ahead of me.,S02E18,330
"Okay, you think you're ready to hit the water?",S02E18,331
I guess.,S02E18,332
"Don't worry, you'll be a natural.",S02E18,333
Okay.,S02E18,334
Whoo hoo! This is awesome!,S02E18,335
Whoa yeah!,S02E18,336
I told you you'd be a natural.,S02E18,337
"Oh, look, one foot.",S02E18,338
"Oh, look, no feet.",S02E18,339
Gnarly!,S02E18,340
Cowabunga!,S02E18,341
"Hey, what are you doing here?",S02E18,342
This is my private lesson.,S02E18,343
"You know you're dreaming, right?",S02E18,344
What?,S02E18,345
"Wake up, Teddy!",S02E18,346
"Teddy, wake up.",S02E18,347
"Honey, you okay?",S02E18,348
What happened?,S02E18,349
The last thing I remember I was at my surfing lesson.,S02E18,350
Yeah.,S02E18,351
"Well, uh, that didn't go too well.",S02E18,352
"On your first wave, you shouted, I'm a natural!",S02E18,353
And then you landed on your head.,S02E18,354
Oh no.,S02E18,355
I missed my smoothie date.,S02E18,356
He was so cute.,S02E18,357
What happened to you?,S02E18,358
I was almost smothered by my elevator buddy.,S02E18,359
"Oh yeah, big whoop.",S02E18,360
We were almost killed in a helicopter crash.,S02E18,361
Didn't you hear me? I missed my smoothie date.,S02E18,362
"Wow, bad day for the Duncans.",S02E18,363
It's almost like the whole family's cursed.,S02E18,364
What are you all looking at me for?,S02E18,365
Huh? I I don't know anything about a curse.,S02E18,366
Didn't you mention something about a curse earlier?,S02E18,367
No no no.,S02E18,368
No no.,S02E18,369
I think I might have mentioned something about a purse.,S02E18,370
Why would I mention something about a curse?,S02E18,371
"I mean, nothing's happened to Charlie or you.",S02E18,372
That's true.,S02E18,373
I'm good.,S02E18,374
Fore!,S02E18,375
Mr. Duncan?,S02E18,376
Hi.,S02E18,377
"Um, I was just doing just doing a quick plant inspection.",S02E18,378
"Yeah, that's a that's a ficus.",S02E18,379
We missed you yesterday at the timeshare presentation.,S02E18,380
"If you don't attend the one today,",S02E18,381
We'll be forced to charge you for your entire trip.,S02E18,382
-Everything? -Down to the last macadamia nut.,S02E18,383
Timeshare?,S02E18,384
-Hey.,S02E18,385
-Hey.,S02E18,386
"You're watching tv, but it's not on.",S02E18,387
I don't deserve entertainment.,S02E18,388
"Dude, what's the matter with you?",S02E18,389
I can't get what happened in the helicopter out of my head.,S02E18,390
I just feel like a coward.,S02E18,391
"Well, normally I'd say that's because you are a coward,",S02E18,392
"But I made this promise to be good, so I won't say that.",S02E18,393
"When the helicopter pilot passed out, I just",S02E18,394
I froze.,S02E18,395
I didn't do anything.,S02E18,396
Except scream like a little girl,S02E18,397
Is something else I won't say.,S02E18,398
"You know, it almost feels like you are saying those things.",S02E18,399
"Being good is new to me, so there's gonna be some snags.",S02E18,400
I just feel like a total loser.,S02E18,401
"Well, wait a minute.",S02E18,402
I made a promise to God to do something good.,S02E18,403
"And if I help you face your fears, that would count, right?",S02E18,404
And then God and I would be square.,S02E18,405
"-You'd do that for me? -That's what good people do, right?",S02E18,406
"I mean, I'm just guessing here.",S02E18,407
"Hey, elevator buddy.",S02E18,408
"Oh, dear, what happened to you?",S02E18,409
Swimming jellyfish.,S02E18,410
Things keep happening.,S02E18,411
"Come on, Charlie,",S02E18,412
Let's go see the pretty garden,S02E18,413
Or let's go see the pretty boy.,S02E18,414
The garden's not going anywhere.,S02E18,415
-Kai.,S02E18,416
-Teddy.,S02E18,417
How are you feeling? That was quite the fall you took yesterday.,S02E18,418
"Oh yeah, but I'm fine now.",S02E18,419
So can we reschedule that smoothie?,S02E18,420
"Hold on, let me check.",S02E18,421
How about after my next surf lesson? Wanna meet then?,S02E18,422
"Sure, I'd love that.",S02E18,423
-Then it's a date.,S02E18,424
-Second time's the charm.,S02E18,425
"Well, that went well, didn't it, Charlie?",S02E18,426
Charlie?,S02E18,427
Charlie!,S02E18,428
Previously on Good luck Charlie,S02E19,0
The Duncans are going to Hawaii!,S02E19,1
What?!,S02E19,2
-I'm Teddy.,S02E19,3
"-Aloha, Teddy.",S02E19,4
I'm kai.,S02E19,5
We missed you yesterday at the time share presentation.,S02E19,6
"If you don't attend the one today,",S02E19,7
We'll be forced to charge you for your entire trip.,S02E19,8
What are you doing?,S02E19,9
Putting a curse on you.,S02E19,10
Swimming and jellyfish.,S02E19,11
Things keep happening.,S02E19,12
"Please, God, if you let me live through this,",S02E19,13
I promise I'll do something good.,S02E19,14
Charlie? Charlie?,S02E19,15
"Charlie? Here, girl.",S02E19,16
"Come out, come out wherever you are,",S02E19,17
Before Teddy starts to cry.,S02E19,18
"-Hey, honey.",S02E19,19
"-Oh, dad.",S02E19,20
"-What's up? -Oh, nothing.",S02E19,21
Just a quick plant inspection.,S02E19,22
"Yep, ficus.",S02E19,23
"Teddy, you okay?",S02E19,24
I'm fine.,S02E19,25
"So have you seen anyone around the hotel from the family,",S02E19,26
"You know, kid-wise? You've already seen me,",S02E19,27
So I guess it'd have to be one of the others like P.,S02E19,28
J.,S02E19,29
Or Gabe or Charlie.,S02E19,30
Did you hit your head again?,S02E19,31
Did you hit yours?,S02E19,32
What's with all the questions?,S02E19,33
"Hold on, hold on.",S02E19,34
"Here you go, sweetie.",S02E19,35
-You need to wear one of these. -Why?,S02E19,36
Because we don't want you to get lost.,S02E19,37
Let's go.,S02E19,38
"Okay, come on, let's go this way.",S02E19,39
Today's all burnt toast ,S02E19,40
"Running late, and dad jokes",S02E19,41
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S02E19,42
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S02E19,43
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S02E19,44
There it is up on the roof,S02E19,45
"I've been there, I've survived",S02E19,46
So just take my advice,S02E19,47
"Hang in there, baby",S02E19,48
Things are crazy,S02E19,49
But I know your future's bright,S02E19,50
"Hang in there, baby",S02E19,51
There's no maybe,S02E19,52
Everything turns out all right,S02E19,53
Your life is up and down,S02E19,54
But trust me it comes back around,S02E19,55
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S02E19,56
"Hang in there, baby.",S02E19,57
"Come on, P.",S02E19,58
J.,S02E19,59
I need your list of fears.,S02E19,60
"Don't rush me. That reminds me,",S02E19,61
"Number 27, being how do you spell rushed?",S02E19,62
Gimme that.,S02E19,63

"Spiders, unicorns,",S02E19,67
"Trolls, ogres.",S02E19,68
"Okay, how about we start the things actually exist?",S02E19,69
Good idea.,S02E19,70
Where you gonna find an ogre in Hawaii?,S02E19,71
"Okay, item number one.",S02E19,72
"-You ready? -Yeah, I think so.",S02E19,73
"Hiya, P.",S02E19,74
J.,S02E19,75
How you doing?.,S02E19,76
Fine.,S02E19,77
Don't be afraid.,S02E19,78
Allow me to introduce myself.,S02E19,79
I'm not scary the clown.,S02E19,80
You look a little sweaty.,S02E19,81
Try my handkerchief.,S02E19,82
Yeah.,S02E19,83
Make it stop. Make it stop!,S02E19,84
This is gonna take a while.,S02E19,85
Thank you anyway.,S02E19,86
"Whoa, honey! What happened?",S02E19,87
Remember that curse I was telling you about?,S02E19,88
-That's what happened. -What are you talking about?,S02E19,89
Come here.,S02E19,90
I'll tell you what I'm talking about.,S02E19,91
"Okay, I was on the putting green with Charlie.",S02E19,92
When I stepped on sacred ground and got cursed.,S02E19,93
Then I danced on sacred ground.,S02E19,94
And got the rest of the family cursed.,S02E19,95
Still not hearing about the giant neck.,S02E19,96
"Okay, then I decided to go for a relaxing swim.",S02E19,97
With jellyfish.,S02E19,98
"To cover the welts, I put on a lei,",S02E19,99
Only to discover that I'm allergic to the plumeria flower.,S02E19,100
That's how I got a giant neck.,S02E19,101
Wait a minute.,S02E19,102
Wait a minute.,S02E19,103
All of this is because of a curse?,S02E19,104
"Yes, all of it.",S02E19,105
"Me getting stuck in the elevator, Teddy getting knocked out,",S02E19,106
The boys almost crashing in a helicopter accident.,S02E19,107
You buying that shirt.,S02E19,108
What? You don't like this?,S02E19,109
I lost the receipt.,S02E19,110
I can't take it back.,S02E19,111
The curse!,S02E19,112
"Honey, come on.",S02E19,113
There is no such thing as a curse.,S02E19,114
Everything that has happened is just a coincidence.,S02E19,115
"All right, you know what you need?",S02E19,116
A size 43 turtleneck?,S02E19,117
"Honey, what you need is a nice relaxing day.",S02E19,118
At the spa.,S02E19,119
Go pamper yourself.,S02E19,120
Get a massage.,S02E19,121
Get a steam.,S02E19,122
Just get all this curse stuff put out of your head.,S02E19,123
"Okay, maybe you're right.",S02E19,124
I'm overreacting.,S02E19,125
Of course you are.,S02E19,126
"Bob, honey, be honest with me.",S02E19,127
How bad do I look?,S02E19,128
Every time I look at you.,S02E19,129
All I see is my beautiful wife.,S02E19,130
Aw.,S02E19,131
That's nice.,S02E19,132
"Okay, I saw this on tv.",S02E19,133
"If you can walk across these coals,",S02E19,134
you won't be afraid of anything.,S02E19,135
I don't know.,S02E19,136
"Come on, you can do it.",S02E19,137
It's all about mind control.,S02E19,138
Now take a moment to empty your mind completely.,S02E19,139
Done.,S02E19,140
-Already? -Let me check.,S02E19,141
"Yeah, done.",S02E19,142
"Okay, come on.",S02E19,143
Take a deep breath and focus.,S02E19,144
I'm just gonna go find the guy,S02E19,145
Whoo!,S02E19,146
I did it.,S02E19,147
P.,S02E19,148
J.,S02E19,149
", the coals weren't lit.",S02E19,150
Lit? Like fire lit?,S02E19,151
"Yeah, you're supposed to walk across hot coals.",S02E19,152
But that would hurt.,S02E19,153
And you know I suffer from S.,S02E19,154
F.,S02E19,155
S.,S02E19,156
-S.,S02E19,157

"It's real, Gabe.",S02E19,161
Why do you think I never played hopscotch?,S02E19,162
"Excuse me, ma'am, have you seen",S02E19,163
Oh!,S02E19,164
Mom?,S02E19,165
What happened?,S02E19,166
Full body massage.,S02E19,167
Turns out the massage oil had plumeria in it.,S02E19,168
Doctor says I'm gonna be fine.,S02E19,169
Is it bad?,S02E19,170
"No no, you've never looked more",S02E19,171
-What? -That's it.,S02E19,172
Just more.,S02E19,173
"Listen, mom, there's something that I need to tell you.",S02E19,174
-It's about Charlie. -Yeah?,S02E19,175
She's,S02E19,176
Doing the hula.,S02E19,177
"Oh, that's adorable.",S02E19,178
That's the greatest thing I've ever seen.,S02E19,179
"Hi, Charlie.",S02E19,180
Welcome to the opportunity of a lifetime.,S02E19,181
A chance to own a timeshare of paradise.,S02E19,182
"Before we begin, Mr. Duncan,",S02E19,183
Quick question.,S02E19,184
I lost the receipt.,S02E19,185
I can't take it back.,S02E19,186
It's not about your shirt.,S02E19,187
Is Mrs. Duncan on her way?,S02E19,188
"Man, I hope not.",S02E19,189
"If both spouses aren't at the presentation,",S02E19,190
We're going to have to charge you for your entire trip.,S02E19,191
"Okay, then I will be right back with my lovely wife.",S02E19,192
Or somebody else.,S02E19,193
Quick favor.,S02E19,194
I need you to pretend to be mom.,S02E19,195
"Dad, really bad time to get super weird.",S02E19,196
I just found out that my wife has.,S02E19,197
To be at the timeshare presentation.,S02E19,198
"Obviously, I can't take mom.",S02E19,199
Please.,S02E19,200
This is an emergency.,S02E19,201
"All right, fine, just give me a minute.",S02E19,202
-Hey.,S02E19,203
-Oh.,S02E19,204
Ready for our date?,S02E19,205
"Actually, I have one more slight delay.",S02E19,206
I have to help my dad with something.,S02E19,207
"Teddy, I'm starting to think you don't wanna hang out with me.",S02E19,208
No no no.,S02E19,209
"No, I totally do.",S02E19,210
It's not gonna take long. I'll just meet you on the beach in an hour?,S02E19,211
-I'll be there.,S02E19,212
-Great.,S02E19,213
-Really gotta go.,S02E19,214
-Don't rush me.,S02E19,215
I'm coming.,S02E19,216
"Wow, you are gonna be great as your mom.",S02E19,217
"Hey, what are we doing up here?",S02E19,218
You're gonna overcome your fear of heights.,S02E19,219
By jumping off this cliff into the water below.,S02E19,220
Whoa! Are you crazy?,S02E19,221
People do it all the time.,S02E19,222
"Yeah, but those people are professionals.",S02E19,223
There's nothing to be afraid of.,S02E19,224
"He's right, P.",S02E19,225
J.,S02E19,226
It's gonna be okay.,S02E19,227
Just jump.,S02E19,228
Stop! Are you crazy? Do you wanna get yourself killed?,S02E19,229
P.,S02E19,230
J.,S02E19,231
", empty your mind.",S02E19,232
Quiet.,S02E19,233
I think he can hear us.,S02E19,234
"Come on, you can do it.",S02E19,235
"I don't think so, Gabe.",S02E19,236
Maybe I should start with something smaller?,S02E19,237
P.,S02E19,238
J.,S02E19,239
P.,S02E19,240
J.,S02E19,241
Yeah.,S02E19,242
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be down there.,S02E19,243
"Luckily there was a little ledge, see?",S02E19,244
"And some steps, see?",S02E19,245
So you jumped four feet?,S02E19,246
And what a rush!,S02E19,247
Yeah!,S02E19,248
"Before we begin, let's get to know each other a little.",S02E19,249
Why don't we start with the Duncans?,S02E19,250
-Of course. -Why don't you stand up and introduce yourselves?,S02E19,251
- Bob.,S02E19,252
- Ted Amy.,S02E19,253
Tedamy.,S02E19,254
Tedamy?,S02E19,255
That's an interesting name.,S02E19,256
"Yeah, well, my parents were really messed up.",S02E19,257
"So, Bob and tedamy,",S02E19,258
How'd this happen?,S02E19,259
Uh,S02E19,260
He was my exterminator.,S02E19,261
And he came over to my apartment.,S02E19,262
With that giant tank of poison on his back.,S02E19,263
And I just knew that bobby-boo was the one for me.,S02E19,264
"Just so you know, I don't wear the tank on my back.",S02E19,265
No one cares about the details.,S02E19,266
- I care. - Do we have to do this here?,S02E19,267
"Let's meet someone else, shall we? You guys.",S02E19,268
"Man, it feels good to conquer your fears.",S02E19,269
P.,S02E19,270
J.,S02E19,271
", you didn't conquer anything.",S02E19,272
"You ran from a clown,",S02E19,273
Walked across slightly warm coals.,S02E19,274
And jumped down four feet onto a ledge.,S02E19,275
Which I did not know would be there.,S02E19,276
P.,S02E19,277
J.,S02E19,278
", I made a promise that I would do something good.",S02E19,279
And do you know who I made that promise to?,S02E19,280
The guy upstairs.,S02E19,281
Bill from Seattle?,S02E19,282
"He seems like a nice guy, but what does he care about",S02E19,283
More upstairs.,S02E19,284
"I promised God, P.",S02E19,285
J.,S02E19,286
We gotta keep trying.,S02E19,287
Fine.,S02E19,288
"Well, I have a fear of bedspreads.",S02E19,289
"Oh, look, I overcame it.",S02E19,290
"Actually, that's a quilt.",S02E19,291
"Ooh, this is a quilt?",S02E19,292
"Fine. If you won't do it for yourself,",S02E19,293
"Or me, do it for Charlie.",S02E19,294
She looks up to you.,S02E19,295
She does?,S02E19,296
Did you see that?,S02E19,297
Fine.,S02E19,298
I'll give it one more shot.,S02E19,299
Turns out there's plumeria in the shampoo.,S02E19,300
"Be honest, is it bad?",S02E19,301
"No no, you look fine, mom.",S02E19,302
"Oh, that's good.",S02E19,303
"Remember, it's not about spending money.",S02E19,304
It's about spending your vacation in paradise.,S02E19,305
I really need to use the restroom.,S02E19,306
We have a break coming up in 90 minutes.,S02E19,307
I'm gonna make this simple.,S02E19,308
I am going to pee now.,S02E19,309
Is it going to be in A: That plant?,S02E19,310
B: That trashcan?,S02E19,311
C: The bathroom in the hallway?,S02E19,312
Please go with c.,S02E19,313
Fine.,S02E19,314
You may leave.,S02E19,315
Now let's talk about payment plans.,S02E19,316
- Excuse me.,S02E19,317
"- Yes, tedamy.",S02E19,318
How much longer are we gonna be here?,S02E19,319
Only five and a half more hours.,S02E19,320
But I have a date with a really cute boy.,S02E19,321
I thought you were married.,S02E19,322
"Well, I'm married, not dead.",S02E19,323
Is there any way that I can leave sooner?,S02E19,324
"Sure, sign that paper",S02E19,325
And you are free to go right now.,S02E19,326
Great.,S02E19,327
Okay.,S02E19,328
Aloha.,S02E19,329
"All right, the ball is now officially rolling.",S02E19,330
All I did was go to the bathroom.,S02E19,331
We have sold our first timeshare unit.,S02E19,332
"Congratulations, Bob and tedamy Duncan.",S02E19,333
Should have picked the plant.,S02E19,334
What did you say this was called again?,S02E19,335
Parasailing.,S02E19,336
You're gonna go up in the air.,S02E19,337
- And get a gentle peaceful - Up in the air?,S02E19,338
You didn't say anything about up in the air.,S02E19,339
What did you think the parachute was for?,S02E19,340
Parachute? I thought this was a very colorful cape.,S02E19,341
How do I get out of this thing?,S02E19,342
Fine fine fine fine.,S02E19,343
"If you don't wanna do it,",S02E19,344
just signal the guy on the boat like this.,S02E19,345
"Hey, boat guy! Hey, boat guy!",S02E19,346
"That was the go signal, wasn't it?",S02E19,347
"Yep, you might wanna start running.",S02E19,348
I'm kind of glad we weren't able to get together until now.,S02E19,349
Because this could not be more perfect.,S02E19,350
I know.,S02E19,351
It's beautiful.,S02E19,352
"Kai, this is my brother P.",S02E19,353

", kai.",S02E19,357
"Teddy, what did you do?",S02E19,358
I had a date on the one spot on the beach.,S02E19,359
Where idiots fall out of the sky.,S02E19,360
I'm talking about the timeshare.,S02E19,361
We now own this room.,S02E19,362
All I did was sign a piece of paper.,S02E19,363
"Which bought us a timeshare,",S02E19,364
Which we can't afford.,S02E19,365
You are the worst wife I've ever had.,S02E19,366
"Well, I'm sorry.",S02E19,367
Why don't you make P.,S02E19,368
J.,S02E19,369
Your wife?.,S02E19,370
Because I'm sure he'd do a much better job.,S02E19,371
People. Quiet!,S02E19,372
Why are you wearing a mop?,S02E19,373
Because my hair's coming out in clumps. Wanna see?,S02E19,374
No no.,S02E19,375
Mop's good.,S02E19,376
Mop it up.,S02E19,377
"Hey, kids, there's something that I have to tell you.",S02E19,378
"I know this is gonna sound really crazy, but here goes.",S02E19,379
We've been cursed.,S02E19,380
- Cursed? - Yes.,S02E19,381
"By mano, a grumpy hawaiian man.",S02E19,382
Who does not like it when you do the robot on sacred ground.,S02E19,383
A curse? Come on.,S02E19,384
Think about it. Everything bad,S02E19,385
Started happening after I got us cursed.,S02E19,386
- Like the helicopter.,S02E19,387
- And mom's fatness.,S02E19,388
- Me getting knocked out.,S02E19,389
- And mom's baldness.,S02E19,390
- The timeshare.,S02E19,391
- And mom's grotesqueness.,S02E19,392
"Okay, got it.",S02E19,393
Wait a second.,S02E19,394
Back up.,S02E19,395
What's this about a timeshare?.,S02E19,396
"Go on and tell her, bobby-boo.",S02E19,397
"- She bought it, not me. - You bought a timeshare?",S02E19,398
"Okay,",S02E19,399
the only reason we were at that stupid thing.,S02E19,400
Was so dad wouldn't have to pay for the room.,S02E19,401
"Whoa, but let's not forget about the curse.",S02E19,402
"Okay, you not telling me about",S02E19,403
a timeshare has nothing to do with a curse.,S02E19,404
Or does it?,S02E19,405
So that's it. We're cursed forever?,S02E19,406
"No, we are not.",S02E19,407
"I got us into this mess,",S02E19,408
and now I'm gonna get us out of it.,S02E19,409
I'm gonna find mano and have him reverse the curse.,S02E19,410
What?,S02E19,411
I'll tell mano to reverse the curse.,S02E19,412
Looks like you're going to the doctor again.,S02E19,413
Plumeria tea.,S02E19,414
"Oh, nuts.",S02E19,415
"Hey, excuse me. Are you mano?",S02E19,416
I am mano.,S02E19,417
"Yeah, listen, you put this curse on my family.",S02E19,418
And I was just wondering if you could reverse it.,S02E19,419
Curse.,S02E19,420
- There is no curse. - There isn't?,S02E19,421
I just say that to keep the guests out of the plants.,S02E19,422
I'm the gardener.,S02E19,423
But what about all the bad stuff that's happened to us?,S02E19,424
Just got lucky I guess.,S02E19,425
My family thinks the curse is real.,S02E19,426
Tell them it's not.,S02E19,427
I could do that.,S02E19,428
Or we could have a little fun.,S02E19,429
You say that with an evil look in your eye.,S02E19,430
That gives me pleasure.,S02E19,431
The curse removal ceremony now begins.,S02E19,432
We are so lucky he does this.,S02E19,433
You have no idea.,S02E19,434
"First, the family except for the youngest male,",S02E19,435
Must circle the mother hopping.,S02E19,436
And chanting Big and gross.,S02E19,437
Big and gross.,S02E19,438
She's the one that's cursed the most.,S02E19,439
What should I do?,S02E19,440
That's the best part.,S02E19,441
You do the robot.,S02E19,442
I do a good robot.,S02E19,443
"Big and gross, big and gross",S02E19,444
She's the one that's cursed the most,S02E19,445
"Big and gross, big and gross",S02E19,446
She's the one that's cursed the most,S02E19,447
"Looking good, guys.",S02E19,448
Making memories here.,S02E19,449
She's the one that's cursed the most,S02E19,450
How come Gabe doesn't have to do this?,S02E19,451
I don't know.,S02E19,452
Seems awfully chummy with that mano guy.,S02E19,453
"Guys, I think they're just messing with us.",S02E19,454
Mr.,S02E19,455
"Duncan, there you are.",S02E19,456
We had a little accident with your timeshare contract.,S02E19,457
and tiki torch.,S02E19,458
"So if you don't mind, we need to get your wife's signature again.",S02E19,459
It's working. Keep going!,S02E19,460
"Big and gross, big and gross",S02E19,461
She's the one that's cursed the most.,S02E19,462
"All right, all right, all right.",S02E19,463
I wanna make a toast.,S02E19,464
I wanna make a toast.,S02E19,465
"To the love of my life,",S02E19,466
My very beautiful wife Amy.,S02E19,467
Happy anniversary.,S02E19,468
Thank you for making me the luckiest man on earth.,S02E19,469
- I love you.,S02E19,470
- I love you too.,S02E19,471
- Cheers.,S02E19,472
- Cheers.,S02E19,473
"Aw, isn't that sweet?",S02E19,474
Mom and dad finally got to have their romantic moment in Hawaii.,S02E19,475
"As for me, not so much,",S02E19,476
But that's okay because family vacations.,S02E19,477
Are about spending time with family.,S02E19,478
"Teddy, wanna go for a walk?",S02E19,479
"Here, wrap this up.",S02E19,480
"What am I supposed goodbye, Charlie.",S02E19,481
"Good luck, Charlie.",S02E19,482
Whatever.,S02E19,483
"Hi, I'm P.",S02E19,484
J.,S02E19,485
Duncan.,S02E19,486
"Tonight, we've had a lot of fun with the subject of S.",S02E19,487
F.,S02E19,488
S.,S02E19,489
Sensitive foot syndrome.,S02E19,490
But sensitive foot syndrome is a serious problem.,S02E19,491
That affects almost a dozen people across the globe.,S02E19,492
"Come, walk with me.",S02E19,493
It is a particularly sensitive day.,S02E19,494
Now you see what me and,S02E19,495
almost eleven other guys have to go through.,S02E19,496
Hey. What're you doing?,S02E19,497
I'm inform people about S.,S02E19,498
F.,S02E19,499
S.,S02E19,500
P.,S02E19,501
J there's no such thing.,S02E19,502
It doesn't exist.,S02E19,503
Really?,S02E19,504
We're gonna live!,S02E19,505
P.,S02E20,0
J.,S02E20,1
", I got good news and bad news.",S02E20,2
"Okay, what's the bad news?",S02E20,3
It's time for the annual fishing trip with dad.,S02E20,4
What's the good news?,S02E20,5
It's your turn to go.,S02E20,6
What? Hold on.,S02E20,7
I went last year.,S02E20,8
It's your turn to go.,S02E20,9
"Yeah, but when you're out of the house,",S02E20,10
I'll be the one going every year.,S02E20,11
"Come on, everyone knows I'm never leaving.",S02E20,12
Just can't hear that same stupid joke dad tells every year.,S02E20,13
You mean the one where he passes gas,S02E20,14
"and goes, hey, I didn't know this was a motorboat?",S02E20,15
"Hey, boys, who wants to go fishing with dad?",S02E20,16
-He does.,S02E20,17
-He does.,S02E20,18
You know what? You can quit your arguing.,S02E20,19
'Cause this year I rented a bigger boat.,S02E20,20
You both get to go.,S02E20,21
-Yay.,S02E20,22
-Yay.,S02E20,23
I just hope it ain't a motorboat.,S02E20,24
Today's all burnt toast ,S02E20,25
"Running late, and dad jokes",S02E20,26
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S02E20,27
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S02E20,28
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S02E20,29
There it is up on the roof,S02E20,30
"I've been there, I've survived",S02E20,31
So just take my advice,S02E20,32
"Hang in there, baby",S02E20,33
Things are crazy,S02E20,34
But I know your future's bright,S02E20,35
"Hang in there, baby",S02E20,36
There's no maybe,S02E20,37
Everything turns out all right,S02E20,38
Your life is up and down,S02E20,39
But trust me it comes back around,S02E20,40
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S02E20,41
"Hang in there, baby.",S02E20,42
what did you get for number four?,S02E20,43
Why didn't you just look at my paper?,S02E20,44
That would be cheating.,S02E20,45
"If I text, it's just friends hanging out.",S02E20,46
"You spent the whole weekend with her, Harry.",S02E20,47
-Should I leave? -They have this fight all the time.,S02E20,48
You should be home with your wife.,S02E20,49
Not out there with your hands all over her.,S02E20,50
Her name is Gracie.,S02E20,51
I'm sorry.,S02E20,52
I can't just hear and listen to this.,S02E20,53
You two need to work this out.,S02E20,54
Now whoever this Gracie is,S02E20,55
-She's a car.,S02E20,56
-She's a car.,S02E20,57
Of course she's a car.,S02E20,58
I'm so glad I could help.,S02E20,59
She's an old car,S02E20,60
That's taking my spot in the garage.,S02E20,61
When are you gonna get rid of that thing?,S02E20,62
I am not selling my baby to some stranger.,S02E20,63
"Actually, I've been thinking about buying a car.",S02E20,64
"Do you hear that, Harry?",S02E20,65
I don't know her that well.,S02E20,66
"Oh, come on, she's practically family.",S02E20,67
Well,S02E20,68
I guess I could consider it.,S02E20,69
"-Teddy, would you like to meet Grace? -Sure.",S02E20,70
I'll take you right out as soon as you wash your hands.,S02E20,71
Tomorrow is gonna be such a tough day.,S02E20,72
It sure is.,S02E20,73
"You have no idea what tomorrow is, do you?",S02E20,74
"No, ma'am, I do not.",S02E20,75
It's Charlie's first day of preschool.,S02E20,76
And I'm not looking forward to it,S02E20,77
Because she's gonna be crying and screaming,S02E20,78
and grabbing onto my legs like all the kids did.,S02E20,79
"Honey, if you want, I'll take her.",S02E20,80
And miss all that? Are you crazy?,S02E20,81
"Hey, mom, dad, can I talk to you guys for a sec?",S02E20,82
"Sure, honey, what's up?",S02E20,83
"Okay, so Ivy's dad has offered to sell me his car.",S02E20,84
And I'd like to ask for you guys to loan me the money.,S02E20,85
"-Sure. -Now before you say no,",S02E20,86
I made this presentation and wait. What?,S02E20,87
We said okay.,S02E20,88
"'Cause the thing is, I spent a lot of time putting this presentation together",S02E20,89
so I'd really like to present it.,S02E20,90
"Goodness gracious,",S02E20,91
-there's lots of graphs and charts.,S02E20,92
-Yes.,S02E20,93
I'll give you an extra 50 bucks if we can leave now.,S02E20,94
That concludes our presentation.,S02E20,95
Okay.,S02E20,96
"Okay, here we go.",S02E20,97
It's the first day.,S02E20,98
It's not gonna be pretty.,S02E20,99
"Okay, now",S02E20,100
"Mommy needs you to be brave, okay?",S02E20,101
"And I promise I'm gonna come back real soon to pick you up,",S02E20,102
-Okay? -Okay.,S02E20,103
Big hugs.,S02E20,104
That was easy.,S02E20,105
I'm so happy that was so easy.,S02E20,106
-What happened to you? -Sprained my arm so I can't go fishing.,S02E20,107
What happened to you?,S02E20,108
Sprained my eye.,S02E20,109
"-Aw, forget it.",S02E20,110
-This isn't gonna work.,S02E20,111
Why do we always have to go fishing?,S02E20,112
Why can't dad go with one of his friends?,S02E20,113
Wait a minute.,S02E20,114
You just said something really interesting.,S02E20,115
I did? Oh shoot.,S02E20,116
Now I wish I had been listening.,S02E20,117
"If we can get dad to take some of his friends fishing,",S02E20,118
then we don't have to go.,S02E20,119
"You're right. Okay, who are dad's friends?",S02E20,120
He doesn't have any.,S02E20,121
-Are you sure? -Think about it.,S02E20,122
Have youver answered the door,S02E20,123
"and said, dad, your friends are here?",S02E20,124
So all we gotta do is find dad a friend.,S02E20,125
You mean like fix him up?,S02E20,126
That's right.,S02E20,127
We gotta get dad a dude.,S02E20,128
Well,S02E20,129
I guess this is goodbye.,S02E20,130
"Mr. Wentz,",S02E20,131
would you like a moment alone?,S02E20,132
He slept in the back seat last night.,S02E20,133
I just wanna make sure that you really wanna do this.,S02E20,134
So you really wanna sell your car?,S02E20,135
-Well -He's selling the car!,S02E20,136
"Teddy, before you go,",S02E20,137
would you take a picture of me and my special girl?,S02E20,138
Sure.,S02E20,139
I meant Gracie.,S02E20,140
Of course you did.,S02E20,141
"Hey, honey, how'd Charlie's first day of school go?",S02E20,142
Awful.,S02E20,143
"Oh no, what happened? She make a scene?",S02E20,144
"No, she didn't. She just walked through the door",S02E20,145
without a care in the world.,S02E20,146
What was the awful part?,S02E20,147
I just told you.,S02E20,148
But I know what the problem is.,S02E20,149
Mm-hmm.,S02E20,150
Charlie is the fourth child.,S02E20,151
So I didn't get to spend enough time with her.,S02E20,152
We did not get enough bonding.,S02E20,153
"Okay, so with more bonding,",S02E20,154
"then she'll cry when you drop her off at school,",S02E20,155
and that's a good thing?,S02E20,156
Yes.,S02E20,157
"Okay, try and stay with me, Bob.",S02E20,158
You seem a little slow today.,S02E20,159
"Hey guys, I think Teddy just pulled up in her new car.",S02E20,160
-Let's go check it out.,S02E20,161
-Yeah.,S02E20,162
Is it noticeable?,S02E20,163
"Oh, honey. Are you okay?",S02E20,164
"-Yeah, no, I'm fine. -Well, what happened?",S02E20,165
I was driving home and in the middle of the road there was this squirrel.,S02E20,166
So you swerved to avoid it and you hit something?,S02E20,167
"No, I stopped and I honked.",S02E20,168
So then someone hit you?,S02E20,169
This is my accident.,S02E20,170
Let me tell it.,S02E20,171
"Anyway, I got out of my car and I tried to Chase it off,",S02E20,172
but it was stuck to this huge wad of gum.,S02E20,173
What flavor?,S02E20,174
Who cares?,S02E20,175
"By the way, to get back to the earlier conversation,",S02E20,176
P.,S02E20,177
J.,S02E20,178
Had the most bonding time.,S02E20,179
"Anyway, while I was staring at the squirrel,",S02E20,180
a garbage truck was backing out of an alley,S02E20,181
and it smashed right into the car.,S02E20,182
Do you think it can be fixed?,S02E20,183
"Honey, I'm afraid it's gonna cost more",S02E20,184
to fix than the car is worth.,S02E20,185
This is awful.,S02E20,186
What's Mr. Wentz gonna say when he finds out?,S02E20,187
Baby!,S02E20,188
I bet he says baby.,S02E20,189
Hey!,S02E20,190
It's my friend Jimmy's dad here to pick up my friend Jimmy.,S02E20,191
"Come in, say hi to my dad.",S02E20,192
"-Hi, I'm Mark.",S02E20,193
-Bob.,S02E20,194
I knew you guys would hit it off.,S02E20,195
So you're Jimmy's dad?,S02E20,196
Yeah.,S02E20,197
And your Gabe's.,S02E20,198
What don't you guys have in common?,S02E20,199
So where is Jimmy?,S02E20,200
"Dad, please, we're focusing on Jimmy's dad.",S02E20,201
Who is also wondering where Jimmy is.,S02E20,202
"Guys, enough with the Jimmy.",S02E20,203
"There are other things to talk about besides Jimmy,",S02E20,204
"like fishing, which I know you both love.",S02E20,205
Not me.,S02E20,206
I can't do anything outdoorsy.,S02E20,207
-Allergies.,S02E20,208
-Oh.,S02E20,209
Sure wish Jimmy would mentioned that in the pre-interview.,S02E20,210
"Hey oh, sorry.",S02E20,211
"Dad, I didn't realize you had company.",S02E20,212
Bring your guy in.,S02E20,213
My guy's not working out.,S02E20,214
I just remembered Jimmy left about an hour ago.,S02E20,215
Bye-bye.,S02E20,216
"Dad, there's somebody I am dying for you to meet.",S02E20,217
This is what's your name again?,S02E20,218
-Roger.,S02E20,219
-Right.,S02E20,220
"Roger, this is my dad Bob.",S02E20,221
-How you doing? -Hey.,S02E20,222
Tell my dad what you just ordered.,S02E20,223
"Dad, wait'll you hear this.",S02E20,224
This is going to blow your mind.,S02E20,225
The kwikki fishy combo.,S02E20,226
The guy comes into a chicken place and orders fish.,S02E20,227
He loves fish.,S02E20,228
You love to fish.,S02E20,229
"Roger, Bob, perfect together.",S02E20,230
"Actually, I ordered the fish for my wife.",S02E20,231
I hate fish.,S02E20,232
Tease.,S02E20,233
"All right, come on, let's go.",S02E20,234
"Gabe, what is going on?",S02E20,235
"What's going on is you better stop being so fussy, mister,",S02E20,236
or you're gonna end up alone.,S02E20,237
"Okay, Charlie, are you ready to have some fun?",S02E20,238
Because today is mommy and Charlie day.,S02E20,239
Yay!,S02E20,240
"Okay, let's try that again.",S02E20,241
Today is mommy and Charlie day.,S02E20,242
Yay!,S02E20,243
"Boy, we got some work to do.",S02E20,244
"All right, here's what we're gonna do.",S02E20,245
"We're gonna play hide and seek, okay?",S02E20,246
Cover your eyes and count to 10.,S02E20,247
"One, two here we come.",S02E20,248
"Ahh, you found me.",S02E20,249
On his farm he had a duck,S02E20,250
E-I-e-I-o! With a quack quack here,S02E20,251
"And a quack quack there, here a quack, there a quack",S02E20,252
"Everywhere a quack quack, old MacDonald had a farm",S02E20,253
E-I-e-I-o!,S02E20,254
What a day.,S02E20,255
Ooh!,S02E20,256
We laughed.,S02E20,257
We played.,S02E20,258
We sang.,S02E20,259
You are so gonna cry tomorrow.,S02E20,260
"Look who got out of bed, everybody.",S02E20,261
"-Hi, Mr.",S02E20,262
Wentz.,S02E20,263
"-Hello, Teddy.",S02E20,264
"Hello, Ivy.",S02E20,265
"Hello, Mary Lou.",S02E20,266
"Honey, we said our hellos",S02E20,267
"at the top of the stairs, remember?",S02E20,268
Right right.,S02E20,269
I came by to see how you're doing,S02E20,270
"and to say again,",S02E20,271
I'm so sorry about Gracie.,S02E20,272
"That's okay, Teddy.",S02E20,273
I guess it was just her time.,S02E20,274
I just wish I had a chance to say goodbye.,S02E20,275
"Hello, Mary Lou.",S02E20,276
"Okay, let's get you a cup of tea, okay?",S02E20,277
-Come on.,S02E20,278
-Bye.,S02E20,279
-Wow.,S02E20,280
-Yeah.,S02E20,281
This is awful.,S02E20,282
I wish there was some way I could help him.,S02E20,283
"Hey, your dad said that he just wanted to say goodbye, right?",S02E20,284
-Right.,S02E20,285
-So he just needs closure.,S02E20,286
I know how to do that.,S02E20,287
Uh-oh.,S02E20,288
You got that crazy look in your eye.,S02E20,289
"No, this isn't crazy at all.",S02E20,290
This is good.,S02E20,291
This could work.,S02E20,292
Did your dad and the car have a special song?,S02E20,293
"Okay, day number two.",S02E20,294
Not gonna be easy.,S02E20,295
"All right, Charlie, we had a lot of fun yesterday, didn't we?",S02E20,296
"Yeah, we did.",S02E20,297
"So today's gonna be really hard for you, okay?",S02E20,298
You might wanna cry.,S02E20,299
It's okay.,S02E20,300
It's okay if you wanna cry.,S02E20,301
But I was the Jack in the box.,S02E20,302
That's my baby.,S02E20,303
See that? She can't let go.,S02E20,304
"Oh hey, dad.",S02E20,305
Um what's this?,S02E20,306
We're just having a little mixer with the guys from Billy's bait and tackle shop.,S02E20,307
"Yeah, here, grab a drink.",S02E20,308
Mingle.,S02E20,309
Don't be shy.,S02E20,310
"Okay, you two in the kitchen now.",S02E20,311
We'll be right back.,S02E20,312
"If you guys get hungry, there are fish crackers and yummy worms.",S02E20,313
"Water, fresh or salt.",S02E20,314
"All right, what's going on?",S02E20,315
-Nothing.,S02E20,316
-Just a couple kids having a bait shop party.,S02E20,317
That's all.,S02E20,318
"You guys don't wanna go fishing with me, do you?",S02E20,319
"Well, I wanna go fishing with you.",S02E20,320
"-No, you don't.",S02E20,321
"-No, I really don't.",S02E20,322
"Do you think when I ask you to go fishing,",S02E20,323
it's cause I wanna go fishing?,S02E20,324
Careful.,S02E20,325
This has all the signs of a trick question.,S02E20,326
"Guys, I just wanna spend time with my sons.",S02E20,327
"I don't care what we do,",S02E20,328
just so long we do it together.,S02E20,329
So we can do something else besides fishing?,S02E20,330
"Guys, there's all sorts of things we can do.",S02E20,331
We can go golfing.,S02E20,332
We can go bowling.,S02E20,333
We can go to the movies.,S02E20,334
I don't care.,S02E20,335
-I vote for the movies.,S02E20,336
-Yeah.,S02E20,337
But we're not sitting with you.,S02E20,338
Why not?,S02E20,339
"Well, you know how popcorn affects your stomach?",S02E20,340
"And then you make that joke,",S02E20,341
this movie must be rated p.,S02E20,342
U.,S02E20,343
I got one for every venue.,S02E20,344
"Okay, all right, we're gonna get started, everyone.",S02E20,345
I'd like to thank you all for coming and joining us,S02E20,346
for a celebration of the life,S02E20,347
of Gracie Wentz.,S02E20,348
Now there's so many people here,S02E20,349
"that loved gracie her family, her friends,",S02E20,350
Roy from Roy's automotive.,S02E20,351
I know.,S02E20,352
I know.,S02E20,353
What can I say about Gracie?,S02E20,354
She was a giver.,S02E20,355
"In fact, she gave her life",S02E20,356
so that a squirrel could live.,S02E20,357
"Now unfortunately, that squirrel couldn't be with us today,",S02E20,358
"but if it could, I know it would say",S02E20,359
Thank you.,S02E20,360
Does anyone else have any memories they would like to share of Gracie?,S02E20,361
Ivy.,S02E20,362
"Come on, sweetie.",S02E20,363
You got it.,S02E20,364
My first memory of Gracie,S02E20,365
was when I was five years old.,S02E20,366
"We were in the garage and dad said,",S02E20,367
don't touch the car.,S02E20,368
That's right.,S02E20,369
He did.,S02E20,370
"Then when I was seven,",S02E20,371
"dad was washing her and he said to me,",S02E20,372
don't touch the car.,S02E20,373
"-Then when I was around nine -Oh oh oh,",S02E20,374
I-I think what Ivy is trying to say,S02E20,375
"is that even though she never touched the car,",S02E20,376
right? The car touched her.,S02E20,377
"No, I'm saying I wasn't allowed to touch the car.",S02E20,378
"Okay, Ivy, I think you're done.",S02E20,379
Now Mary Lou Wentz would like to dedicate a song,S02E20,380
to the memory of the dear departed Gracie.,S02E20,381
Amazing Gracie,S02E20,382
How sweet the car that Harry sold to T,S02E20,383
She smashed it up to save a squirrel,S02E20,384
And now she is so sorry.,S02E20,385
And that concludes our service. What?,S02E20,386
Read this for me.,S02E20,387
Thank you.,S02E20,388
"Apparently, C.",S02E20,389

"Well, Charlie, we both hit big milestones this week.",S02E20,393
You started preschool and I got my first car.,S02E20,394
"Unfortunately, my milestone only lasted",S02E20,395
A mile.,S02E20,396
"Anyway, turns out you very independent which is a good thing.",S02E20,397
not all Duncan kids let go so easily.,S02E20,398
Do it again.,S02E20,399
Do it again.,S02E20,400
"Of course I will, honey.",S02E20,401
Seen enough? I know I have.,S02E20,402
"Good luck, Charlie.",S02E20,403
Whoa!,S02E20,404
"Oh, that cottage cheese is funk-ay.",S02E20,405
Time to say goodbye.,S02E20,406
"Oh, when the cheese",S02E20,407
Smells really bad,S02E20,408
"Oh, when the cheese",S02E20,409
Smells really bad,S02E20,410
"Oh, it is time to dump it out",S02E20,411
And have a cup of yogurt instead.,S02E20,412
"Oh, but I I don't want yogurt.",S02E20,413
-She just wants cheese -Cottage cheese,S02E20,414
-She said cottage cheese -Cottage cheese,S02E20,415
It's because I had yogurt earlier,S02E20,416
Why don't you just wait,S02E20,417
Till dinner?,S02E20,418
'Cause I need a snack right now,S02E20,419
She needs a snack!,S02E20,420
I need a snack!,S02E20,421
Snack time!,S02E20,422
Yeah! Yeah!,S02E20,423
I need a snack,S02E20,424
Yeah,S02E20,425
"Ooh-oh, snack time",S02E20,426
Oh! Oh! It's snack time,S02E20,427
"Yeah, snack",S02E20,428
Snack time!,S02E20,429
Oh oh oh oh oh.,S02E20,430
"Hey, you know what I was thinking, honey?",S02E21,0
We should have a little romantic getaway.,S02E21,1
This weekend just you and me.,S02E21,2
"Guys, please, we're trying to eat here.",S02E21,3
I think that sounds fun. Where should we go?,S02E21,4
"Casper, Wyoming",S02E21,5
The most romantic city.,S02E21,6
In Wyoming.,S02E21,7
Is the bug convention in Casper this year?,S02E21,8
The bug convention?,S02E21,9
"Well, I'll just check the old calendar.",S02E21,10
Ha! Now that is a coincidence.,S02E21,11
"Hey, mom, I think you should go.",S02E21,12
Why? You planning to throw a party while we're gone?,S02E21,13
Now that is a coincidence.,S02E21,14
Oh.,S02E21,15
"Well, party's off.",S02E21,16
I'm not going.,S02E21,17
"Why not, mom?",S02E21,18
Bug convention sounds like a lot of,S02E21,19
I can't even get through it.,S02E21,20
What do you even do at a bug convention?,S02E21,21
Nothing.,S02E21,22
It's just a bunch of exterminators.,S02E21,23
In a cramped conference room talking about deadly gas.,S02E21,24
And then it gets boring.,S02E21,25
"First of all, honey, we are not a bunch.",S02E21,26
We are a swarm.,S02E21,27
Huh?!,S02E21,28
"We got a lot of fun bug-related lingo like that,",S02E21,29
"Like we don't get rooms, we nest.",S02E21,30
"We don't dine, we feed.",S02E21,31
"I can't believe I'm saying this, but can someone drive me to school?",S02E21,32
"All right, guys, you know what?",S02E21,33
Pest control is what I do for a living.,S02E21,34
"I know it just may be rats and roaches and maggots to you,",S02E21,35
But it's my bread and butter.,S02E21,36
And I'm done with my bread and butter.,S02E21,37
Today's all burnt toast ,S02E21,38
"Running late, and dad jokes",S02E21,39
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S02E21,40
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S02E21,41
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S02E21,42
There it is up on the roof,S02E21,43
"I've been there, I've survived",S02E21,44
So just take my advice,S02E21,45
"Hang in there, baby",S02E21,46
Things are crazy,S02E21,47
But I know your future's bright,S02E21,48
"Hang in there, baby",S02E21,49
There's no maybe,S02E21,50
Everything turns out all right,S02E21,51
Your life is up and down,S02E21,52
But trust me it comes back around,S02E21,53
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S02E21,54
"Hang in there, baby.",S02E21,55
"-Hey, mom.",S02E21,56
"-Hey, honey.",S02E21,57
Remember when I went off to college to K.,S02E21,58

"Kwikki chikki university, the we can trainning someone are",S02E21,62
I remember it well.,S02E21,63
"Well, back in those crazy college days",S02E21,64
Those two crazy college days.,S02E21,65
I met this guy named Gravy,S02E21,66
"And I told him , he could moved in town,",S02E21,67
He could stay with us.,S02E21,68
"And I just found out he's moving to Denver,",S02E21,69
And he's gonna be working at kwikki chikki.,S02E21,70
"Okay, I think I see what is this going, when is this happening?",S02E21,71
Party!,S02E21,72
Right about now.,S02E21,73
P.,S02E21,74
J.,S02E21,75
", I can't believe you.",S02E21,76
-Gravy! -P.,S02E21,77
J.,S02E21,78
!.,S02E21,79
That was the kwikki chikki handshake.,S02E21,80
I was hoping.,S02E21,81
"Dude, you didn't tell me your sister was so hot.",S02E21,82
"Gravy, stay as long as you like.",S02E21,83
Sweet crib!,S02E21,84
"Dude, I'm so psyched you're here, dude.",S02E21,85
-This is gonna be a blast. -Epic!,S02E21,86
-Just think of all those wild times at college.,S02E21,87
-Yeah.,S02E21,88
"Dude, remember the time the girls from hamburger tech",S02E21,89
came and partied with us?,S02E21,90
Yeah yeah!,S02E21,91
Or what about the time,S02E21,92
I think that's the only story we have.,S02E21,93
"Hey, mom, listen to this.",S02E21,94
It's from that advice column dear Tammy.,S02E21,95
"It says, dear Tammy,",S02E21,96
Recently a car I owned for 20 minutes.,S02E21,97
Was sadly wrecked.,S02E21,98
How do I ask my parents for another one?,S02E21,99
-That's almost exactly what happened to you.,S02E21,100
-I know.,S02E21,101
"So then dear Tammy replied,",S02E21,102
"if your parents love you, they will buy you a new car.",S02E21,103
And be glad they did.,S02E21,104
-That is so strange.,S02E21,105
-Yeah.,S02E21,106
Because dear Tammy passed away three years ago.,S02E21,107
"Well, that's a pretty good answer for a dead lady, right?",S02E21,108
"Mom, please,",S02E21,109
owning that car was the best 20 minutes of my life.,S02E21,110
"Honey, if it were up to me, I'd buy you a new car.",S02E21,111
The problem is your father.,S02E21,112
He's been on a tear lately about saving money.,S02E21,113
What is wrong with him?,S02E21,114
He's always saving and planning for the future.,S02E21,115
What did grandma and grandpa do to him?,S02E21,116
How badly do you want this car?,S02E21,117
-Really badly.,S02E21,118
-Sit down.,S02E21,119
"Teddy,",S02E21,120
Your father is a simple man.,S02E21,121
"-Yes, I'm with you so far.",S02E21,122
-Okay.,S02E21,123
"If you want something from him,",S02E21,124
Then you need to do something he wants to do.,S02E21,125
"Then when he's in his happy place, just strike like a cobra.",S02E21,126
"Okay, what are you talking about?",S02E21,127
"The bug convention, Teddy",S02E21,128
The bug convention.,S02E21,129
You go there with your father and he will be so happy,S02E21,130
He will buy you a car.,S02E21,131
Perfect.,S02E21,132
I'll go to the bug convention.,S02E21,133
How bad could it be?.,S02E21,134
You have no idea.,S02E21,135
I went to one convention.,S02E21,136
I still have the dreams.,S02E21,137
"Hey, Gabe, guess what I got.",S02E21,138
"Last time we played this game, it was lice.",S02E21,139
My mom gave me this cool new video camera.,S02E21,140
For getting cut from the baseball team.,S02E21,141
How does getting cut from the team get you a camera?,S02E21,142
"She felt bad for me,",S02E21,143
and my dad gave me a skateboard for trying out.,S02E21,144
I love sports.,S02E21,145
This is pretty cool.,S02E21,146
-We should make a movie.,S02E21,147
-Yeah.,S02E21,148
The camera does not love you.,S02E21,149
But it does love me.,S02E21,150
So I should be the star.,S02E21,151
"Dude, you're getting more like your mom every day.",S02E21,152
So what kind of movie should we make?,S02E21,153
How about a romantic comedy?,S02E21,154
Everyone loves a good romcom.,S02E21,155
I thought of something while you were talking.,S02E21,156
Let's make a monster movie.,S02E21,157
"Cool, but where are we gonna find a scary monster?",S02E21,158
Boo!,S02E21,159
I think we found our monster.,S02E21,160
"Done, done",S02E21,161
And not done.,S02E21,162
"How are you doing, A. Dunc?",S02E21,163
A. Dunc?,S02E21,164
"Oh, yeah.",S02E21,165
That's my new name for you.,S02E21,166
Amy just wasn't kind of working for me.,S02E21,167
Aren't you loving him?,S02E21,168
Loving? No no.,S02E21,169
Liking? No.,S02E21,170
Getting on my very last nerve?,S02E21,171
Ding ding ding! We have a winner.,S02E21,172
"Gravy honey, did you forget something in the kitchen?",S02E21,173
"No, I'm good.",S02E21,174
I meant your pants.,S02E21,175
"Yeah, I know.",S02E21,176
I just like to take those off when I get home.,S02E21,177
It's kind of how I unwind.,S02E21,178
"Okay, look, I get it that you're trying to be comfortable.",S02E21,179
That is not how we roll in the Duncan house.,S02E21,180
"Dude, you're right.",S02E21,181
This is so much more comfortable.,S02E21,182
"Honey, you're not gonna believe this.",S02E21,183
Teddy wants to go to the bug convention with me.,S02E21,184
Are we going pantsless now?,S02E21,185
This is the best day ever!,S02E21,186
"attack of the 50-foot baby,",S02E21,187
"Scene 1, take 1.",S02E21,188
"Okay, you're a mad scientist. Action!",S02E21,189
"Now that I've finished my super growth formula,",S02E21,190
It's time to test it out on an ordinary grape.,S02E21,191
Cut.,S02E21,192
Action.,S02E21,193
"It works on fruit, It works on fruit,",S02E21,194
But what about on human beings?,S02E21,195
I'll test it out myself.,S02E21,196
But first let me check on my baby.,S02E21,197
"Baby. Oh, baby!",S02E21,198
"Charlie, come here.",S02E21,199
Come here.,S02E21,200
-Can you go drink the stuff now? -No.,S02E21,201
It's just juice.,S02E21,202
And cut.,S02E21,203
"Dude, what's your sister's problem? She's gotta drink the stuff.",S02E21,204
She's two.,S02E21,205
"When I was two, I drank everything.",S02E21,206
Just let me talk to her.,S02E21,207
"Charlie sweetheart,",S02E21,208
You're doing great.,S02E21,209
The picture's gonna look terrific.,S02E21,210
Here's the thing.,S02E21,211
"When we say drink the stuff,",S02E21,212
"You gotta drink the stuff, okay?",S02E21,213
"Okay, great.",S02E21,214
Here we go.,S02E21,215
"Are you ready to Jake, what are you doing?",S02E21,216
We need that for the movie.,S02E21,217
I'm doing an experiment.,S02E21,218
I wanna see if it turns my pee blue.,S02E21,219
P.,S02E21,220
J.,S02E21,221
!.,S02E21,222
"Hey, mom, what's up?",S02E21,223
What's up?,S02E21,224
Look at what Gravy has done to this place.,S02E21,225
"Hey, he tidied up.",S02E21,226
I've had it.,S02E21,227
He's disgusting.,S02E21,228
He's a slob.,S02E21,229
I can't take it anymore.,S02E21,230
I want him out.,S02E21,231
Is this about the onion ring in the toilet?,S02E21,232
'cause he needs a target.,S02E21,233
"Either you tell him by the end of the day tomorrow,",S02E21,234
Or I do it.,S02E21,235
But he's my best friend from college.,S02E21,236
"Chicken college, a two-day chicken college!",S02E21,237
"All right, okay.",S02E21,238
But this has to be done the right way,S02E21,239
'cause gravy's actually really sensitive.,S02E21,240
"All right, bad news, guys.",S02E21,241
I just drank a gallon of water and we are out of onion rings.,S02E21,242
"Casper, Wyoming,",S02E21,243
"Bug convention, guys in overalls.",S02E21,244
You talk now.,S02E21,245
"Hey, hors d'oeuvres.",S02E21,246
"Help yourself, honey.",S02E21,247
Okay.,S02E21,248
This is good.,S02E21,249
It's crunchy.,S02E21,250
Freeze-dried ants.,S02E21,251
All the food here is insect-based. Isn't that fun?,S02E21,252
-Bob.,S02E21,253
-Murray.,S02E21,254
"Hey, I would like to introduce you to my daughter Teddy.",S02E21,255
"Hi. Hey, dad, do I have any legs in my teeth?",S02E21,256
She's a charmer.,S02E21,257
"So, Bob, you gonna pop by my speech?",S02E21,258
"Keynote address, whatever.",S02E21,259
"Yeah, I got a new way to kill termites",S02E21,260

"Well, I'm sure it will be very clear after the presentation.",S02E21,270
"I've seen your presentations, Duncan.",S02E21,271

"Well, I told you, we madean album.",S02E22,87
"Dad, I am so sorry.",S02E22,88

It's my fault for having sweet memories,S02E22,90
And kids.,S02E22,91

Not a good idea to wear a patch on both eyes.,S02E22,93

"Great, thanks to Leo's awesome lemonade recipe.",S02E22,95

"Fine, we'll split the quarter.",S02E22,117
12 cents?,S02E22,118
Why do you get the extra Penny?,S02E22,119
Because it was my idea.,S02E22,120
I'm the brains of this operation.,S02E22,121
"Yeah, but I'm the eye candy.",S02E22,122
"Okay, this is stupid.",S02E22,123
"The next time we have an extra Penny, you can have it.",S02E22,124
-I want this one.,S02E22,125
-This one's mine.,S02E22,126

This partnership is over.,S02E22,131
Fine.,S02E22,132

I don't need you.,S02E22,134
I don't need anybody.,S02E22,135
I need your mom.,S02E22,136
She's my ride.,S02E22,137

"Uh, we need to talk.",S02E22,139
"Sure thing, homecoming date. She's my homecoming date!",S02E22,140
Maybe not.,S02E22,141
Here we go.,S02E22,142
Let's just sit.,S02E22,143
So in that video your exact words were,S02E22,144

Unless you had a girlfriend.,S02E22,146
-So? -So I'm gonna get you one.,S02E22,147
"Oh, that's funny.",S02E22,148
"No no, I'm serious.",S02E22,149
There's this new girl in school,S02E22,150
and I think she's perfect for you.,S02E22,151
What makes her perfect?,S02E22,152
She doesn't know anything about you.,S02E22,153
So her name is Alicia.,S02E22,154
She's very sweet.,S02E22,155
She is very attractive.,S02E22,156
So I just have to figure out a way to make you,S02E22,157
Appealing.,S02E22,158
Is it gonna be easy? No.,S02E22,159
Is it gonna be doable?,S02E22,160
It has to be.,S02E22,161
"Hey, dad! Come up here.",S02E22,162

P.,S02E22,175
J.,S02E22,176
", this is fantastic.",S02E22,177
"Hey, did you track down madman Marty?",S02E22,178
Yeah yeah.,S02E22,179

The Bob Duncan experience is back!,S02E22,186
How how long do we do this?,S02E22,187
Until the imaginary applause dies down.,S02E22,188
Kind of quiet around here.,S02E22,189
Want to know why?,S02E22,190
Leo's lemonade lounge? You're competing with me?,S02E22,191
Competing would imply competition.,S02E22,192
"And from what I see, hmph, I don't have any.",S02E22,193
The s in leo's is backwards.,S02E22,194
I did that on purpose.,S02E22,195
It's cuter.,S02E22,196
Is that why you put two ms in lemonade?,S02E22,197
I did?,S02E22,198
"Check your spelling, eye candy.",S02E22,199
Forget that.,S02E22,200
Wait till you see what else I have.,S02E22,201
I'm gonna squeeze you out of business.,S02E22,202
Like you squeeze a lemon.,S02E22,203
"-You know, because to make lemonade -Yeah, I got it.",S02E22,204
"This isn't over, Leo.",S02E22,205
"Oh, but I think it is.",S02E22,206
He's evil.,S02E22,207
He's diabolical.,S02E22,208
I despise him.,S02E22,209
The backwards s sure is cute though.,S02E22,210
"Okay, there she is.",S02E22,211
"Oh, I don't know about this, Teddy.",S02E22,212
-Alicia might be too hot for me. -Wh,S02E22,213

"Okay, so here's what you're gonna do.",S02E22,216
"You walk over to alicia and you say, I'm Emmett.",S02E22,217
I've seen you around and I just wanted to say hi.,S02E22,218
-Then what? -Then you just walk away.,S02E22,219
"Oh, okay. What kind of walk are you looking for?",S02E22,220
Like a moonwalk or like a robot or like a shuffle,S02E22,221
"Oh, none none none of the above.",S02E22,222
You just leave.,S02E22,223
You're creating mystery.,S02E22,224
"-Oh, one more thing. -Wait, what are you doing?",S02E22,225

"When life hands you lemons,",S02E22,455
You go to homecoming with Emmett.,S02E22,456

-And it's just one dance.,S02E22,459
-Until prom.,S02E22,460
"Wait, what? What do you have on me?",S02E22,461
"-Oh, not much. -Oh!",S02E22,462
Teddy says yes to prom.,S02E22,463
Teddy says yes to marriage?,S02E22,464
That one took a bit of editing.,S02E22,465
"If he thinks that's gonna happen,",S02E22,466
"He's gonna need some good luck, Charlie.",S02E22,467

Just like touchy.,S02E23,14
"Ivy, why are people calling me gigi?",S02E23,15
I don't know.,S02E23,16
Maybe it's a nickname.,S02E23,17
Are they saying gigi like the name gigi,S02E23,18
Or the letters G.,S02E23,19
G.,S02E23,20
?.,S02E23,21
I don't know.,S02E23,22
Probably the second one.,S02E23,23

Glamorous gal.,S02E23,27
Golden goddess.,S02E23,28
Genetic greatness.,S02E23,29
Goody-goody.,S02E23,30
It means goody-goody.,S02E23,31
Goody-goody why would they call me that?,S02E23,32
Maybe it's because you always play by the rules.,S02E23,33
And never do anything bad.,S02E23,34
Or something like that.,S02E23,35
"Okay, but I am so not a goody-goody.",S02E23,36
"If anything, I am a baddy-baddy.",S02E23,37
"T, only a goody-goody.",S02E23,38
Would say baddy-baddy.,S02E23,39
I've been bad.,S02E23,40
I've broken rules.,S02E23,41
-Like when? -Like the time,S02E23,42
"-Okay, I've bent rules. -Like when?",S02E23,43
Like the time,S02E23,44

I am a G.,S02E23,46
G.,S02E23,47
"I'm glad you came around, girl.",S02E23,48
'Cause I'm the one who started it.,S02E23,49
Today's all burnt toast ,S02E23,50
"Running late, and dad jokes",S02E23,51
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S02E23,52
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S02E23,53
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S02E23,54
There it is up on the roof,S02E23,55
"I've been there, I've survived",S02E23,56
So just take my advice,S02E23,57
"Hang in there, baby",S02E23,58
Things are crazy,S02E23,59
But I know your future's bright,S02E23,60
"Hang in there, baby",S02E23,61
There's no maybe,S02E23,62
Everything turns out all right,S02E23,63
Your life is up and down,S02E23,64
But trust me it comes back around,S02E23,65
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S02E23,66
"Hang in there, baby.",S02E23,67
"Gabe, I need your help.",S02E23,68
So I just found out I have this horrible nickname.,S02E23,69
You mean G.,S02E23,70
G.,S02E23,71
?.,S02E23,72
How do you know about that?,S02E23,73
I helped Ivy come up with it.,S02E23,74
"Okay, well, I'm not a goody-goody.",S02E23,75
And I wanna do something naughty to prove it.,S02E23,76
"First, stop using words like naughty.",S02E23,77
Got it.,S02E23,78
"Now I'll help you be bad, But you gotta help me with something.",S02E23,79
"-What? -Well, I'm grounded,",S02E23,80
But I need to get ungrounded by Saturday.,S02E23,81
Jake invited me to super adventure land.,S02E23,82
Super adventure land reopened?,S02E23,83
"Yeah, that's why I got there before they close down again.",S02E23,84
Now how do I get mom and dad to let me go?,S02E23,85
"Well, you could try behaving better.",S02E23,86
"All right, I don't have time for joke.",S02E23,87
I need answers.,S02E23,88
Why don't you just do something nice for them?,S02E23,89
-Like? -I was in the garage last week.,S02E23,90
And I found this old poem the dad wrote to mom Back In High School.,S02E23,91
"I was gonna give it to her for her birthday,",S02E23,92
But you could do it now.,S02E23,93
Then they'll be putty in my hands.,S02E23,94
"-Thanks, G.",S02E23,95
G.,S02E23,96
-Stop calling me that.,S02E23,97
"-Hi, Charlie.",S02E23,98
"-Hi, G.",S02E23,99
G.,S02E23,100
Argh!,S02E23,101

P.,S02E23,103
J.,S02E23,104
", do we need to talk?.",S02E23,105
About what?,S02E23,106
About why you want me to make you a dress.,S02E23,107
I don't want you to.,S02E23,108
I need you to.,S02E23,109
"Honey, can't you just borrow one of mine?",S02E23,110
This could just be a phase.,S02E23,111
The dress isn't for me.,S02E23,112
It's for Charlie.,S02E23,113
I got an assignment in my home ec class to make an outfit.,S02E23,114
For someone in my family.,S02E23,115
"Okay, next time lead with that.",S02E23,116
So will you do it?,S02E23,117
"Nope, if I do it, how will you learn?",S02E23,118
"Mom, I took this class to meet girls,",S02E23,119
Not to learn stuff.,S02E23,120
"It's my third year taking home ec,",S02E23,121
And I still don't know what ec means.,S02E23,122
"Sorry, kiddo.",S02E23,123
You're on your own.,S02E23,124
"Fine. Well, then will you help me with my civil war report?",S02E23,125
Nope.,S02E23,126
Will you at least tell me who won?,S02E23,127
I've got a daring new plan.,S02E23,128
That's gonna blow away my goody-goody image forever.,S02E23,129
Are you ready for this?,S02E23,130
"Tomorrow,",S02E23,131
-I say we ditch school.,S02E23,132

"Ivy, I don't think you understand what I'm proposing here.",S02E23,134
I'm saying tomorrow.,S02E23,135
We're not going to be in school.,S02E23,136
When school is going on.,S02E23,137
"T, I'm familiar with the concept of ditching.",S02E23,138
So where are we going?,S02E23,139
-Super adventure land.,S02E23,140
-I'm in.,S02E23,141
"Okay, Ivy, it's settled.",S02E23,142

Agggghh!,S02E23,156
"Okay, Charlie, I'm gonna design a dress for you.",S02E23,157
Now don't worry.,S02E23,158
I just watched 10 hours of fashion reality shows.,S02E23,159
So I'm highly qualified.,S02E23,160
Now let's start by taking a look at what you usually wear.,S02E23,161
"Okay, no.",S02E23,162
Wrong.,S02E23,163
"Hate it. Girlfriend, what are you thinking?",S02E23,164
Owls are so last year.,S02E23,165
"Honey, we need to create a whole new look for you,",S02E23,166
Something that screamingcharlie!,S02E23,167
"Oh, sorry I screamed charlie.",S02E23,168
"If I'm gonna make you the perfect dress,",S02E23,169
I need to know more about you.,S02E23,170
So tell me what you like.,S02E23,171
I like toys.,S02E23,172
Toys.,S02E23,173
Fun.,S02E23,174
Youth.,S02E23,175
I'm getting something.,S02E23,176
Wait a second.,S02E23,177
Yes.,S02E23,178
Yes!.,S02E23,179
That's your new look.,S02E23,180
No.,S02E23,181
You are such a diva.,S02E23,182
I love it.,S02E23,183
"Mom, dad, I was feeling so bad.",S02E23,184
About whatever I did to get grounded.,S02E23,185
You sprayed Mrs.,S02E23,186
Dabney with a garden hose.,S02E23,187
It was an accident.,S02E23,188
She was in her kitchen.,S02E23,189
"Anyway, I felt so bad about that,",S02E23,190
That I decided to clean the garage.,S02E23,191
And I found this in one of mom's little boxes.,S02E23,192
-And framed it for you. -What is it?,S02E23,193
It's a love poem dad wrote to mom in High School.,S02E23,194
No no no.,S02E23,195
"You don't have to read it, Gabe.",S02E23,196
"my dearest Amy, how does a dream leave footprints in the sand?",S02E23,197
How does a flower kindle a memory.,S02E23,198
Or candlelight whisper your name?,S02E23,199
"Pretty good so far, huh?",S02E23,200
Pretty good? I'm a plate of soup.,S02E23,201
I don't remember writing that.,S02E23,202
It doesn't even rhyme like a good poem should.,S02E23,203
Look at that.,S02E23,204
That's not even my handwriting.,S02E23,205
"Dad, you wrote it.",S02E23,206
It's signed Bob D.,S02E23,207
Who else would Bob D. be?,S02E23,208
Diddlebock.,S02E23,209
"Hey, dad, watch the language.",S02E23,210
Why would Bob diddlebock.,S02E23,211
Write you a love poem?,S02E23,212
"Okay, during that brief time.",S02E23,213
"In High School when we were broken up,",S02E23,214
I dated Bob diddlebock.,S02E23,215
It was no big deal.,S02E23,216
Not to Bob diddlebock.,S02E23,217
You were a dream that left footprints.,S02E23,218
In his sand.,S02E23,219
I do have that effect on men.,S02E23,220
"Whoa whoa! So the minute we break up,",S02E23,221
You go out and find another guy?,S02E23,222
What was I supposed to do? Go home and cry all day?,S02E23,223
I did.,S02E23,224
"Bob, it's been 20 years.",S02E23,225
Let it go.,S02E23,226
Like you let the poem go?,S02E23,227
We were on a break.,S02E23,228
-How about we take another one? -Works for me.,S02E23,229
"Guys, this was supposed.",S02E23,230
To be a happy moment.,S02E23,231
For me!,S02E23,232
Oh! School's just starting.,S02E23,233
First period is happening right now.,S02E23,234
"Congratulations, t.",S02E23,235
You're officially ditching.,S02E23,236
How does it feel to be bad?,S02E23,237
Great.,S02E23,238
Does your stomach hurt as much as mine?,S02E23,239
"Howdy, young ladies!",S02E23,240
I'm the mayor of super adventure land.,S02E23,241
-Who are you? -I'm Ivy.,S02E23,242
Uh I'm Claudette.,S02E23,243
I'm from Oklahoma.,S02E23,244
My parents aren't here right now.,S02E23,245
They're taking my brothers Rusty and Dusty to the bathroom.,S02E23,246
"Well, that's a little more information.",S02E23,247
"Than I needed, darling.",S02E23,248
"What is wrong with you, Claudette?",S02E23,249
"I'm new at this, okay?",S02E23,250
A cop is staring at us.,S02E23,251
He totally knows we're ditching.,S02E23,252
"T, will you stop? He doesn't care about us.",S02E23,253
Then why is he coming over here?,S02E23,254
Just be cool.,S02E23,255
Nobody's in trouble.,S02E23,256
"Young ladies, you're under arrest.",S02E23,257
We're under arrest?,S02E23,258
-Afraid so. -For what?,S02E23,259
For not having enough fun.,S02E23,260
"And as sheriff of super adventure land,",S02E23,261
I'm gonna have to give you a ticket.,S02E23,262
For a free smoothie.,S02E23,263
Now can we please go have some fun?,S02E23,264
I wanna ride terror in the sky.,S02E23,265
Really?,S02E23,266
'cause I was thinking Mr.,S02E23,267
Chipmunk's kooky clown cars.,S02E23,268
"Yeah, I'm gonna go find Rusty and Dusty.",S02E23,269
"Dad, check out this old photo album I found in the garage.",S02E23,270
You stay out of the garage.,S02E23,271
It's full of misery.,S02E23,272
Let's look at all the great times you and mom have had.,S02E23,273
"Hey, there's you and mom and some handsome guy at the prom.",S02E23,274
That's Bob diddlebock.,S02E23,275
Moving on.,S02E23,276
"Hey, where'd mom get that really cool sports car?",S02E23,277
That's Bob diddlebock's.,S02E23,278
He had two.,S02E23,279
"All right, let's try one more.",S02E23,280
Any chance you had a boat.,S02E23,281
Called the s.,S02E23,282
S.,S02E23,283
Diddlebock?.,S02E23,284
"You know,",S02E23,285
I just can't believe she kept his poem all these years.,S02E23,286
"Anyway, thanks for cheering me up, Gabe.",S02E23,287
"Handsome, smart and rich.",S02E23,288
"Oh, Amy, how did you let him get away?",S02E23,289
"Hey, mom.",S02E23,290
You know what would be a really cool thing to do before Saturday?,S02E23,291
-What's that? -Rip up Bob diddlebock's poem in front of dad.,S02E23,292
Show him it means nothing to you.,S02E23,293
"Gabe, I'm not gonna do that.",S02E23,294
Why?,S02E23,295
Because you still have feelings for him?,S02E23,296
So now you're lurking in the kitchen?,S02E23,297
"Hey, I am always in the kitchen.",S02E23,298
I just happened to be lurking this one time.,S02E23,299
You just answer the question.,S02E23,300
"No, I do not have feelings for Bob diddlebock.",S02E23,301
Then why did you keep his stupid poem all these years?,S02E23,302
Because it's the only love poem anyone ever wrote me.,S02E23,303
That's why.,S02E23,304
"Oh, yeah? Well, that's that's",S02E23,305
That's a pretty good reason.,S02E23,306
"Man, now I just feel bad.",S02E23,307
"You know, the best way to get over feeling bad is.",S02E23,308
To make someone else feel good.,S02E23,309
I can be that someone.,S02E23,310
No? Okay.,S02E23,311
So where should we go next?,S02E23,312
Say cheese!,S02E23,313
Have a super day!,S02E23,314
Ivy!,S02E23,315
-Did you see that? -See what?,S02E23,316
Who wants to take a picture with me? Step right up.,S02E23,317
"Hey, I saw what you did!",S02E23,318
You stole that woman's wallet.,S02E23,319
I don't know what you're talking about. Toodle-oo!,S02E23,320
"Hey, come back here.",S02E23,321
What in tarnation is going on here?,S02E23,322
"The mayor, he's a thief.",S02E23,323
He stole a woman's wallet.,S02E23,324
"-What? -Careful, Bill.",S02E23,325
She's been acting up all day.,S02E23,326
Might be a code 6.,S02E23,327
-Let's go.,S02E23,328
-Wait a minute.,S02E23,329
What's a code 6?,S02E23,330
Possible wacko!,S02E23,331
Why isn't Charlie in preschool?,S02E23,332
I had to pull her out.,S02E23,333
We have work to do.,S02E23,334
Why aren't you in school?,S02E23,335
"Charlie's dress isn't done, and I'm on a deadline.",S02E23,336
"Okay, are any of my kids in school?",S02E23,337
At least I know Teddy is.,S02E23,338
"Mom, I'm freaking out. Would you mind taking a look at my dress?",S02E23,339
"Sure, let's see what you got.",S02E23,340
It's all Charlie's fault.,S02E23,341
She's not selling it.,S02E23,342
Don't blame the model.,S02E23,343
I said be fierce. Is that fierce?,S02E23,344
I don't know.,S02E23,345
"No, you don't, do you?",S02E23,346
This this is a disaster.,S02E23,347
"Ivy, you gotta get me out of here.",S02E23,348
I am not cut out for the slammer.,S02E23,349
Don't worry.,S02E23,350
I've got this.,S02E23,351
Okay.,S02E23,352
"Howdy, sheriff.",S02E23,353
Whoops.,S02E23,354
"Sheriff, I think you dropped 200 fun bucks there.",S02E23,355
Are you trying to bribe me?,S02E23,356
Maybe I am.,S02E23,357
With pink money that has absolutely no monetary value?,S02E23,358
Sheriff.,S02E23,359
I'm on my way.,S02E23,360
"Well, it's your lucky day.",S02E23,361
We're understaffed.,S02E23,362
We just got a code 12.,S02E23,363
What's that?,S02E23,364
Some kid just barfed on the tilt-a-whirl.,S02E23,365
Now you're free to go.,S02E23,366
Thank goodness.,S02E23,367
P.,S02E23,368
J.,S02E23,369
", we're waiting.",S02E23,370
All right.,S02E23,371
Say hello.,S02E23,372
To Charlie.,S02E23,373
Her kicky summer dress is perfect for the 2 year old.,S02E23,374
Who plays all day and parties all night.,S02E23,375
"From nap time to snack time,",S02E23,376
This dress says it all.,S02E23,377
"And if there's an oopsie with a juice box,",S02E23,378
No problem.,S02E23,379
It's washable.,S02E23,380
I have to say I am impressed.,S02E23,381
"Clean lines, nice stitching.",S02E23,382
Excellent job.,S02E23,383
"Thank you and thank you, Charlie.",S02E23,384
Yeah.,S02E23,385
Is that a price tag?,S02E23,386
"All right, b minus.",S02E23,387
"Really? Oh, because buying the dress.",S02E23,388
Is a creative way to solve the problem?,S02E23,389
"No, because this is your third time in my class.",S02E23,390
We're done.,S02E23,391
Hello!,S02E23,392
Can I borrow someone's notes?,S02E23,393
"Sorry, I don't know if you guys noticed.",S02E23,394
I wasn't here yesterday.,S02E23,395
That's right.,S02E23,396
Ditching.,S02E23,397
"Yeah, you told us that.",S02E23,398
"We went to super adventure land,",S02E23,399
"Had a bit of a run-in with the cops,",S02E23,400
Ended up in jail.,S02E23,401
"T, look.",S02E23,402
"-What is he doing here? -Teddy Duncan, would you come up here, please?",S02E23,403
"Hello, I am the sheriff of super adventure land.",S02E23,404
"And because of this young lady,",S02E23,405
We uncovered a ring of pickpockets.,S02E23,406
"That sadly included our own mayor,",S02E23,407
The town crier.,S02E23,408
"And yes, sal the squirrel.",S02E23,409
"And now on behalf of super adventure land,",S02E23,410
"And our parent company, famfunco industries, north America,",S02E23,411
I'm proud to present this super citizen medal.,S02E23,412
To Teddy Duncan.,S02E23,413
I'm not a super citizen.,S02E23,414
I'm a ditcher.,S02E23,415
I'm bad.,S02E23,416
"Well, whatever you are,",S02E23,417
Thank you for saving good wholesome clean family fun.,S02E23,418

"-What is it, Bob? -Something I want you to hear.",S02E23,438
"Okay, I wrote this for you.",S02E23,439
"To my wonderful wife,",S02E23,440
"The love of my life,",S02E23,441
Here is a poem from your bobby-boo.,S02E23,442
I love your sweet hugs.,S02E23,443
Even more than my bugs.,S02E23,444
And your kisses more than chili or stew.,S02E23,445
You do love your stew.,S02E23,446
"Okay, here, there's more.",S02E23,447
There's more.,S02E23,448
Okay.,S02E23,449
"and though our future's unwritten,",S02E23,450
I still remain smitten.,S02E23,451
And will till the end of all time.,S02E23,452
This poem may be late.,S02E23,453
"I know it's not great,",S02E23,454
But at least I know how to rhyme.,S02E23,455
That's very sweet.,S02E23,456
"Thank you, bobby-boo.",S02E23,457
"Eww. I mean, what's going on?",S02E23,458
I have a new poem for my frame.,S02E23,459
"Yes, and it rhymes.",S02E23,460
You guys made up.,S02E23,461
That's just fantastic.,S02E23,462
"You know, we should celebrate.",S02E23,463
How about a trip to super adventure land?,S02E23,464
"Yeah, why not? We haven't been there in a while.",S02E23,465
"-Yeah, sounds good to me. -Yes!",S02E23,466
"Hey, P.",S02E23,467
J.,S02E23,468
", guess what.",S02E23,469
The whole family's going to super adventure land.,S02E23,470
"Oh, didn't you hear?",S02E23,471
There's a big scandal involving the mayor.,S02E23,472
Super adventure land's closed.,S02E23,473
No!,S02E23,474
"Well, Charlie, mom and dad found out I ditched.",S02E23,475
And now I'm grounded.,S02E23,476
It's called consequences.,S02E23,477
Something you get used to when you're a baddy-baddy.,S02E23,478
"Darn, I'm still wearing the medal.",S02E23,479
"Teddy, what are you doing?",S02E23,480
No video diary while you're grounded.,S02E23,481
No video diary while I'm grounded?,S02E23,482
That seems kind of lame.,S02E23,483
I don't know how else to punish you.,S02E23,484
You don't really do anything.,S02E23,485
So you don't think I'm bad?,S02E23,486
"Mom, I'm bad.",S02E23,487
"I'm so bad I'm not even gonna say good luck, Charlie.",S02E23,488
-You just did. -Oh!,S02E23,489
The story you have just seen it's true.,S02E23,490
The outcomes are completely made up.,S02E23,491
"The mayor was found guilty of lying, stealing",S02E23,492
And talking in a ridiculous cartoony voice.,S02E23,493
Ridiculous?! I think not.,S02E23,494
Gabe Duncan eventually made it to super adventure land.,S02E23,495
He was thrown in jail three minutes later,S02E23,496
For spitting off the monorail.,S02E23,497
PJ Duncan did not go on a career in fashion design.,S02E23,498
Amy Duncan,S02E23,499
Just likes having a picture-taken.,S02E23,500
Looking forward to it.,S02E24,0
"Okay, see you then, buddy.",S02E24,1
Clump nugget!,S02E24,2
-Who's a clump nugget? -Mike Gogan.,S02E24,3
"Uh-oh, must be time for bowling with the Gogans.",S02E24,4
Don't you mean losing to the gogans?,S02E24,5
"Hey, come on, let's have a positive attitude.",S02E24,6
"I mean, sure we've lost to them five years in a row,",S02E24,7
And sure we've never come within 50 pins.,S02E24,8
Sure.,S02E24,9
Dad gives the worst pep talks in history.,S02E24,10
"Hey, that's not the way winners talk.",S02E24,11
"Mom, if I knew how winners talked",S02E24,12
my name would be Teddy Gogan.,S02E24,13
"Well now, I don't know if I ever told you kids this,",S02E24,14
But I was the star of the southwest Denver.,S02E24,15
Women's bowling team.,S02E24,16
You were?,S02E24,17
"Oh, gee, I'd love to hear about that.",S02E24,18
Seems like you were on every club and team at that school.,S02E24,19
How did you have time for classes?,S02E24,20
I'm not even sure that school had classes.,S02E24,21
"To me, it was more of an activity center.",S02E24,22
"Dad, I'm sorry to say this,",S02E24,23
But I think I'm too busy for bowling this year.,S02E24,24
"Oh, man.",S02E24,25
I was thinking Gabe could replace me.,S02E24,26
"Okay, I guess we'll just muddle through,",S02E24,27
But believe me.,S02E24,28
You're gonna be missed.,S02E24,29
Thanks for understanding.,S02E24,30
"Thanks, guys.",S02E24,31
Yes! We finally have a chance to win!,S02E24,32
Yeah!,S02E24,33
Why are your arms in the air?,S02E24,34
We're,S02E24,35
Stretching.,S02E24,36
Why are you stretching?,S02E24,37
Because we're happy you're not bowling this year.,S02E24,38
Today's all burnt toast ,S02E24,39
"Running late, and dad jokes",S02E24,40
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S02E24,41
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S02E24,42
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S02E24,43
There it is up on the roof,S02E24,44
"I've been there, I've survived",S02E24,45
So just take my advice,S02E24,46
"Hang in there, baby",S02E24,47
Things are crazy,S02E24,48
But I know your future's bright,S02E24,49
"Hang in there, baby",S02E24,50
There's no maybe,S02E24,51
Everything turns out all right,S02E24,52
Your life is up and down,S02E24,53
But trust me it comes back around,S02E24,54
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S02E24,55
"Hang in there, baby.",S02E24,56
"-You ready, Ivy? -Ready.",S02E24,57
This is Teddy Duncan performing the national anthem,S02E24,58
"Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light",S02E24,59
What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming,S02E24,60
Whose broad stripes and bright st .,S02E24,61
And that was Mary Lou wentz.,S02E24,62
"I'm sorry, Teddy.",S02E24,63
I just love that song.,S02E24,64
It always moves me.,S02E24,65
Can it move you right out of the room?,S02E24,66
Why are you recording it?,S02E24,67
It's for this contest the winner gets a car.,S02E24,68
And the winner also gets to sing the national anthem.,S02E24,69
At a Denver nuggets game.,S02E24,70
And then win a car.,S02E24,71
"Well, good luck.",S02E24,72
I sure do love that song.,S02E24,73
"Yeah, you know, Mrs. Wentz,",S02E24,74
"I'd suggest that you enter the contest,",S02E24,75
But I wanna win a car.,S02E24,76
"T, my mom's not interested.",S02E24,77
Who said I'm not interested?,S02E24,78
"You know, when I was younger,",S02E24,79
It was my dream to become a professional singer.,S02E24,80
Really? What happened?,S02E24,81
"Oh, I got married, then we had Ivy.",S02E24,82
So you're blaming me? I killed your dreams?,S02E24,83
"Of course not, sweetie.",S02E24,84
It was you and your father.,S02E24,85
"If we both entered, we'd have two chances to win.",S02E24,86
"I would love to enter the contest, Teddy,",S02E24,87
But I don't need another car.,S02E24,88
Exactly.,S02E24,89
"If I win, I get the car.",S02E24,90
"If you win, I get the car.",S02E24,91
-I could use a car.,S02E24,92
-Stay out of this.,S02E24,93
"Hey, mom, whatcha doing?",S02E24,94
"Well, guess who just joined her very first social network?",S02E24,95
That's right.,S02E24,96
I'm on buddy page.,S02E24,97
So buddy page is officially not cool anymore.,S02E24,98
-What? -Nothing.,S02E24,99
"So if you ever wanna send me a message, ims, whatevs,",S02E24,100
Just hit me up.,S02E24,101
"Ooh, look who else is on here",S02E24,102

I don't know.,S02E24,108
Should I be buddies with P.,S02E24,109
J.,S02E24,110
?.,S02E24,111
He would love that.,S02E24,112
"Yeah, and after we're buddies",S02E24,113
I could post one of his baby pictures on his page.,S02E24,114
Why post one when you can post them all?,S02E24,115
That is a cute one.,S02E24,116
"Okay, send P.",S02E24,117
J.,S02E24,118
Duncan a buddy request.,S02E24,119

"Okay, hit that button right there.",S02E24,121

"ha ha! Good job, Charlie.",S02E24,123
You did it.,S02E24,124
Hey.,S02E24,125
New buddy request.,S02E24,126
From,S02E24,127
Mom.,S02E24,128

You're never gonna believe this.,S02E24,130
-What? -Yay! Whoo!,S02E24,131
I won the contest!,S02E24,132
Is that what you were gonna say?,S02E24,133
No. I was gonna say I won a car!,S02E24,134
Whoo! I've got to figure out what to wear!,S02E24,135
Isn't it great?,S02E24,136
"Sure, for now.",S02E24,137
for now? What's that supposed to mean?,S02E24,138
"T, you don't know my mom.",S02E24,139
Something always goes wrong.,S02E24,140
My dad and I call it the blip.,S02E24,141
"-The blip? -Yeah,",S02E24,142
"With Mary Lou wentz, there's always a blip.",S02E24,143
I've got it!,S02E24,144
I'll wear an American flag dress.,S02E24,145
"And a red, white and blue hat.",S02E24,146
With sparklers on top.,S02E24,147
So is that the blip?,S02E24,148
"No, that's just crazy.",S02E24,149
"All right, practice time.",S02E24,150
Let's see what you got.,S02E24,151
"-Oh, yes! -Yeah!",S02E24,152
Yeah!,S02E24,153
"Ah, great.",S02E24,154
Here comes Mike gogan.,S02E24,155
And I'll be in the arcade.,S02E24,156
"-Bob! -Hey, Mike!",S02E24,157
Always a pleasure beating you.,S02E24,158
"I mean, meeting you.",S02E24,159
"No, I mean beating you.",S02E24,160
"Well, Mike, if you're so sure you're gonna beat us,",S02E24,161
What say we make this interesting?,S02E24,162
Say 50 bucks.,S02E24,163
-Let's make it $100.,S02E24,164
-Let's make it $500.,S02E24,165
"-Let's make it $1,000.",S02E24,166
-Let's go back to $50.,S02E24,167
Deal.,S02E24,168
"Gabe, let's go.",S02E24,169
In a minute.,S02E24,170
Gotta get the mystery box.,S02E24,171
-What's in it? -Let me repeat the name.,S02E24,172
Mystery box.,S02E24,173
You know it's probably something stupid like a whistle.,S02E24,174
A whistle?,S02E24,175
"Dad, I know a kid from school that knows a kid.",S02E24,176
Whose cousin won a mystery box.,S02E24,177
And do you wanna know what was in it? An mp3 player.,S02E24,178
"Yeah? Well, I know a kid who has a dad who doesn't care.",S02E24,179
Let's go.,S02E24,180
"-Hey, mom.",S02E24,181
"-Hey, P.",S02E24,182
J.,S02E24,183
", you know what?.",S02E24,184
You must have hit the wrong key on your buddy page.,S02E24,185
Because you accidentally declined my buddy request.,S02E24,186
"No, I meant to do that.",S02E24,187
What?,S02E24,188
You don't wanna be my buddy? Why not?,S02E24,189
"Mom, I really love you, but it's kind of lame.",S02E24,190
"See, buddy page is for interacting with my friends.",S02E24,191
And cute girls who would never otherwise talk to me.,S02E24,192
"Okay, it's lame to be buddies with the woman who gave birth to you?",S02E24,193
Now you're getting it.,S02E24,194
"But, P.",S02E24,195
J.,S02E24,196
", if we're buddies,.",S02E24,197
We can post fun stuff on each other's page.,S02E24,198
And then I can find out about what's going on in your life.,S02E24,199
You are so good at explaining why this is a bad idea.,S02E24,200
Thank you.,S02E24,201
"-Hey, Charlie? -Yeah?",S02E24,202
"If you were on buddy page, you'd be my buddy, wouldn't you?",S02E24,203
"No, mama.",S02E24,204
Here I come!,S02E24,205
Mrs.,S02E24,206
"Wentz, that is quite an outfit.",S02E24,207
Wait till you see the hat.,S02E24,208
The batteries are still charging.,S02E24,209
How's my face? Do I look okay?,S02E24,210
"Yeah, you look great.",S02E24,211
I can't wait to see you on the jumbotron.,S02E24,212
Jumbo-what?,S02E24,213
The giant screen at the arena.,S02E24,214
"How else are 20,000 fans gonna be able to see you?",S02E24,215
"20,000?",S02E24,216
All looking at me?,S02E24,217
"-Are you okay, mom? -I did not think this through.",S02E24,218
Why are you putting down your purse?,S02E24,219
Because I'm staying here where there is no jumbotron.,S02E24,220
"-You're not going? -No, I am not.",S02E24,221
"No, okay, it's totally normal to be a little bit nervous.",S02E24,222
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna drive to the arena.,S02E24,223
You're gonna sing the song.,S02E24,224
I'm gonna win a car.,S02E24,225
Everyone's gonna be happy.,S02E24,226
Whoa! No.,S02E24,227
"-That was the sound of a lock, wasn't it? -Yes, it was.",S02E24,228
"-She is not coming out, is she? -No, she's not.",S02E24,229
-Blip? -Blip.,S02E24,230
"Mrs. Wentz, you wanna come out now?",S02E24,231
"No, thank you.",S02E24,232
"If you don't come out, your dream won't come true.",S02E24,233
The dream where you get a car?,S02E24,234
"Yeah, yeah, that's the one.",S02E24,235
"Ivy, say something.",S02E24,236
"Can't blame this one on me and dad, can you?",S02E24,237
"Okay, Mrs. Wentz,",S02E24,238
You made a commitment.,S02E24,239
To show up and sing the national anthem.,S02E24,240
Now you are refusing.,S02E24,241
To honor that commitment.,S02E24,242
"To our nation, the United States of America.",S02E24,243
Now is that what you wanna do?,S02E24,244
Let down the entire country?,S02E24,245
Okay.,S02E24,246
"Hey, mom, how you doing?",S02E24,247
"To be honest, I'm kind of upset.",S02E24,248
Great great. Wanna hand me that remote?,S02E24,249
P.,S02E24,250
J.,S02E24,251
Rejected me as a buddy on buddy page.,S02E24,252
Makes me think he's hiding something.,S02E24,253
He's a teenager.,S02E24,254
Of course he's hiding something.,S02E24,255
Not like us preteens.,S02E24,256
We're an open book.,S02E24,257
I wish there was some way I could view his buddy page.,S02E24,258
There is.,S02E24,259
I could confirm you as a buddy.,S02E24,260
And since I'm P.,S02E24,261
J.,S02E24,262
"'s buddy,.",S02E24,263
You'd be able to look at his page and he'll never know.,S02E24,264
You would do that for me?,S02E24,265
"Sure, I'll just delete some things, confirm you,",S02E24,266
And you're all set.,S02E24,267
It is so nice having a child.,S02E24,268
Who will help me spy on my other children.,S02E24,269
I can't take all the credit.,S02E24,270
I had to get my evil genes from someone.,S02E24,271
"Mary Lou wentz, I am done fooling around.",S02E24,272
Now I want you to unlock that door.,S02E24,273
And get your butt in the car now!,S02E24,274
"Teddy, that's funny.",S02E24,275
Do it again.,S02E24,276
It was pretty good.,S02E24,277
You know what? I give up.,S02E24,278
"I'm sorry, Teddy.",S02E24,279
I just can't sing in front of all those people.,S02E24,280
"Wait, what if you didn't have to sing.",S02E24,281
-In front of all those people? -I'm listening.,S02E24,282
"Okay, I have an idea, but we really do have to go,",S02E24,283
So can I explain it to you in the car? Will you trust me?,S02E24,284
"-Okay, I trust you, Teddy.",S02E24,285
-Okay.,S02E24,286
Teddy gets the trust.,S02E24,287
Teddy gets the car.,S02E24,288
"-Ivy, get my purse.",S02E24,289
-Ivy gets the purse.,S02E24,290
"Whoa, yeah! Good roll, honey.",S02E24,291
"Take that, Duncan.",S02E24,292
"-You're up, honey.",S02E24,293
-Okay.,S02E24,294
Does she have to do this every time?,S02E24,295
Don't talk or she will start over.,S02E24,296
"Come on, precious.",S02E24,297
"Mama needs you now, baby girl.",S02E24,298
-Yeah! -Yeah!,S02E24,299
-Whoo! -All right!,S02E24,300
Let's keep it going.,S02E24,301
"Gabe, get ready.",S02E24,302
Your turn's coming up.,S02E24,303
Where is Gabe?,S02E24,304
"Gabe, come on.",S02E24,305
It's your turn.,S02E24,306
-My turn to what? -To bowl.,S02E24,307
Is that still going on?,S02E24,308
"Gabe, look, this is just a silly game.",S02E24,309
Your family is counting on you.,S02E24,310
"Thanks, dad, since you were talking,",S02E24,311
I grabbed a bunny.,S02E24,312
I got 12 of these.,S02E24,313
Gimme another token.,S02E24,314
"No, you're cut off.",S02E24,315
Let's go.,S02E24,316
I just gotta get this mystery box.,S02E24,317
"No, come on, dad!",S02E24,318
Yes!,S02E24,319
-You got a strike.,S02E24,320
"-Yeah, yeah, whatever.",S02E24,321
Come here.,S02E24,322
"Hey, how you doing? Good. Got any tokens?",S02E24,323
No.,S02E24,324
"Come on, dude, help a brother out.",S02E24,325
I don't have any tokens.,S02E24,326
"You got money, right?",S02E24,327
I wanna sell you some valuable information.,S02E24,328
What kind of valuable information?,S02E24,329
Let me see the money.,S02E24,330
Mom's looking at your buddy page to spy on you.,S02E24,331
What? That's just,S02E24,332
"Mom's looking at my buddy page, huh?",S02E24,333
Bet I could have some fun with this.,S02E24,334
First I better delete some stuff.,S02E24,335
It's almost time to go. Are you okay?,S02E24,336
"I'm okay, but are you sure this is going to work?",S02E24,337
Totally.,S02E24,338
You're gonna be awesome.,S02E24,339
Speaking of awesome.,S02E24,340
"Yeah, I think we're gonna go.",S02E24,341
Without the hat.,S02E24,342
-Yes! -Yes yes!,S02E24,343
Yes! All Gabe has gotta do is just knock down two pins.,S02E24,344
"We win. You can do that in your sleep, right, Gabe?",S02E24,345
What happened?,S02E24,346
I ran out of tokens.,S02E24,347
And now my arm's stuck.,S02E24,348
"Okay, I'll scoot over and you reach up in there.",S02E24,349
And get that box.,S02E24,350
"Little problem, Duncan?",S02E24,351
"Hey, man, you got any tokens?",S02E24,352
"If your kid can't bowl, the Duncans forfeit.",S02E24,353
"Hey, we are not gonna forfeit.",S02E24,354
"Well, we only have the lane for another 10 minutes.",S02E24,355
Where are you going to find another Duncan?,S02E24,356
"It's a long shot,",S02E24,357
But there's one Duncan left.,S02E24,358
"Okay, Charlie, the whole family's counting on you.",S02E24,359
"All you have to do is just knock down two pins,",S02E24,360
And we're not gonna be losers anymore.,S02E24,361
"-Okay, go ahead.",S02E24,362
-Go ahead.,S02E24,363
Go ahead.,S02E24,364
"Okay, it's okay.",S02E24,365
Shake it off.,S02E24,366
All right.,S02E24,367
We're down to our last ball.,S02E24,368
It's a very special ball.,S02E24,369
"Ladies and gentlemen,",S02E24,370
"Please rise for the singing of our national anthem,",S02E24,371
Which will be performed tonight by Denver housewife mary Lou wentz!,S02E24,372
"Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light",S02E24,373
What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming,S02E24,374
We'll take that.,S02E24,375
"Good job, Charlie.",S02E24,376
And the home of the brave,S02E24,377
 yeah! ,S02E24,378
 I said the home ,S02E24,379
 I said the home ,S02E24,380
of the brave.,S02E24,381
.,S02E24,382
"Okay, Charlie, mommy looked on P.",S02E24,383
J.,S02E24,384
's buddy page.,S02E24,385
And found out they're throwing a surprise party for me.,S02E24,386
"-Why, mama? -Well, as P.",S02E24,387
J.,S02E24,388
"Put it,.",S02E24,389
It's a spontaneous celebration of the world's best mom.,S02E24,390
"Now when we walk in, don't forget to act surprised.",S02E24,391
"Hi, everybody, I'm home.",S02E24,392
They must be in the kitchen.,S02E24,393
"Hi, everybody, I'm home.",S02E24,394
The basement.,S02E24,395
Definitely the basement.,S02E24,396
"Hi, everybody,",S02E24,397
I'm home.,S02E24,398
"-Hey, mom. -Where's the",S02E24,399
Where's the what?,S02E24,400
"I mean, what are you talking about?",S02E24,401
I'm talking about you snooping on my buddy page.,S02E24,402
Anything you wanna say to me?,S02E24,403
I hate the Internet.,S02E24,404
"Well, Charlie, Mary Lou sang the national anthem,",S02E24,405
And I won the car.,S02E24,406
"Well, you won the car.",S02E24,407
Seems the contest was sponsored by a toy company.,S02E24,408
I really gotta read the fine print.,S02E24,409
"So not only did you win the car,",S02E24,410
You also won the bowling tournament.,S02E24,411
I don't know why I'm leaving these video diaries for you.,S02E24,412
You should be leaving them for me.,S02E24,413
"Good luck, Teddy, huh?",S02E24,414
I'm kidding.,S02E24,415
"Good luck, Charlie.",S02E24,416
I can't wait to open this mystery box.,S02E24,417
There could be anything in here.,S02E24,418
A whistle?!,S02E24,419
I spent 500 tokens on a whistle?,S02E24,420
"Hello, master.",S02E24,421
Whoa!,S02E24,422
A genie.,S02E24,423
"Hey, you look kind of familiar.",S02E24,424
People say I look like Brad pitt.,S02E24,425
I'm here to grant you three wishes.,S02E24,426
You have one minute.,S02E24,427
Go!.,S02E24,428
"Okay, I wish I knew what to ask for.",S02E24,429
That's one.,S02E24,430
"That counted? Man, I wish I hadn't done that.",S02E24,431
-That's two.,S02E24,432
-Okay.,S02E24,433
Ugh!.,S02E24,434
"Okay, really gotta be careful on this one.",S02E24,435
"Hey, wait, what's going on?",S02E24,436
"-Shh! Not now, not now.",S02E24,437
"-But, P.",S02E24,438
J.,S02E24,439
I wish you've leave me alone.,S02E24,440
And that's three.,S02E24,441
Still got a whistle though.,S02E24,442
"Honey, you are going to lovemy Halloween costume this year.",S02E25,0
But not as much as you are gonna love mine.,S02E25,1
"No, you're gonna love mine more.",S02E25,2
"-No, you're gonna love mine more. -Guys!",S02E25,3
Save the creepiness for tonight.,S02E25,4
"By the way, I can't take Charlie trick-or-treating this year.",S02E25,5
I've got plans.,S02E25,6
Ivy and I can take her.,S02E25,7
"We're going to a party, but that's not until later.",S02E25,8
You wanna know what my plans are?,S02E25,9
"Okay, you forced it out of me.",S02E25,10
I am going out.,S02E25,11
With a girl.,S02E25,12
So is Emmett going as Beyonce again?,S02E25,13
"Her name is Zoey, and I met her while delivering chicken",S02E25,14
"Two piece, dark meat, gravy on the side.",S02E25,15
"-Wow, she sounds great.",S02E25,16
-I know.,S02E25,17
She's a lot of fun.,S02E25,18
You're gonna love her.,S02E25,19
Love her already.,S02E25,20
Stop that.,S02E25,21
"Well, I for one am glad to hear.",S02E25,22
That P.,S02E25,23
J.,S02E25,24
Has gotten over Skyler and has found a new girl.,S02E25,25
"Hey, so long as I don't have to look.",S02E25,26
"At Beyonce Emmett, I'm happy.",S02E25,27
Today's all burnt toast ,S02E25,28
"Running late, and dad jokes",S02E25,29
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S02E25,30
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S02E25,31
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S02E25,32
There it is up on the roof,S02E25,33
"I've been there, I've survived",S02E25,34
So just take my advice,S02E25,35
"Hang in there, baby",S02E25,36
Things are crazy,S02E25,37
But I know your future's bright,S02E25,38
"Hang in there, baby",S02E25,39
There's no maybe,S02E25,40
Everything turns out all right,S02E25,41
Your life is up and down,S02E25,42
But trust me it comes back around,S02E25,43
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S02E25,44
"Hang in there, baby.",S02E25,45
"-Happy Halloween, Mrs.",S02E25,46
Dabney.,S02E25,47
-What do you want?.,S02E25,48
I see you put on witch Halloween costume early this year.,S02E25,49
And I see you're going as evil monster devil child again.,S02E25,50
"Oh, you added the word evil this year.",S02E25,51
Nice touch.,S02E25,52
I like to keep it fresh.,S02E25,53
"Anyhoo, I'm here to talk about the trouble.",S02E25,54
That you always have on Halloween.,S02E25,55
You mean the trouble that started 11 years ago.,S02E25,56
About the same time you learned to walk?,S02E25,57
"Every year, your trees get toilet paper",S02E25,58
and your house gets egged.,S02E25,59
"For just $50, I can make sure that stops.",S02E25,60
So you're offering me protection,S02E25,61
From you.,S02E25,62
From an unnamed hooligan.,S02E25,63
Named Gabe.,S02E25,64
Who hurt you so bad that you can't trust?,S02E25,65
"All right, fine.",S02E25,66
I guess I have no choice.,S02E25,67
-You've got a deal.,S02E25,68
-All right.,S02E25,69
I'll just take that 50 and we'll move on with our lives.,S02E25,70
I don't have that kind of money just sitting around.,S02E25,71
I'm gonna need a little time.,S02E25,72
All right.,S02E25,73
You better hurry.,S02E25,74
It gets dark very early this time of year.,S02E25,75
I love Halloween.,S02E25,76
So do I.,S02E25,77
"Well, Charlie, as you can probably see.",S02E25,78
Us Duncans take Halloween.,S02E25,79
Very seriously.,S02E25,80
I'm home.,S02E25,81
"Oh, I wonder who that could be.",S02E25,82
"Wow, it's dad!",S02E25,83
"Hi, I'm Bob.",S02E25,84
Of Bob's bugs be gone.,S02E25,85
How's your vermin?,S02E25,86
I'm home!,S02E25,87
"Well, if it isn't Ashley Tisdale?",S02E25,88
"I'm mom,",S02E25,89
And I'm a star.,S02E25,90
Ba-bam!,S02E25,91
"Yeah? Well well, I'm not an exterminator.",S02E25,92
I'm a pest control specialist.,S02E25,93
Did I ever tell you about the time,S02E25,94
I went to southwest Denver community college?,S02E25,95
Me want donut.,S02E25,96
Me want donut.,S02E25,97
"Well, things are getting a little ugly.",S02E25,98
We'll see you at Thanksgiving.,S02E25,99
"Hey, Gabe. You gonna put on your costume?",S02E25,100
"Hey, everybody.",S02E25,101
-What are you supposed to be? -I'm a goth wearing a mustache.,S02E25,102
That's kind of a weird costume.,S02E25,103
Not as weird as little bo peep.,S02E25,104
"Well, actually, the little bo peep costume wasn't appropriate",S02E25,105
"There was not enough bo, a little too much peep.",S02E25,106
-Hmm.,S02E25,107
"-No, I'm Mary.",S02E25,108
From Mary Had a Little Lamb .,S02E25,109
Oh! But I seem to be missing something.,S02E25,110
"Oh, little lamb.",S02E25,111
"-Go ahead, Charlie, say it.",S02E25,112
-Baa.,S02E25,113
Carrots? Where's the candy?,S02E25,114
"Oh, we're not giving out candy this year.",S02E25,115
I thought it would be fun to hand out healthy snacks instead.,S02E25,116
We're gonna be that house?,S02E25,117
Our first trick-or-treater.,S02E25,118
Carrots? You're that house?,S02E25,119
"Ivy, we're going to a costume party. Where is your costume?",S02E25,120
"Oh, I've got a costume.",S02E25,121
That is so real.,S02E25,122
"I was gonna put the cleaver on my head,",S02E25,123
But I didn't wanna compete with all this.,S02E25,124
"-Trick or treat! -Oh my gosh, a Teddy bear.",S02E25,125
That is so adorable.,S02E25,126
"You know, my name is Teddy.",S02E25,127
Trick or treat!,S02E25,128
"Here you go, Teddy bear.",S02E25,129
"Carrots. You're kidding, right?",S02E25,130
Teddy bear's got a little tude.,S02E25,131
-Happy Halloween.,S02E25,132
-Thanks.,S02E25,133
Don't bother.,S02E25,134
Mrs. Dabney?,S02E25,135
Go away! This is a recording!,S02E25,136
It's Gabe!,S02E25,137
"Huh! Ironic,",S02E25,138
Considering all the times I've thought about removing your head.,S02E25,139
I'm here for my 50 bucks.,S02E25,140
-First sign this. -What is it?,S02E25,141
A contract guaranteeing.,S02E25,142
That nothing's gonna happen to my house tonight.,S02E25,143
Now go away before you attract the treat-or-trickers.,S02E25,144
You mean the trick-or-treaters?,S02E25,145
Whatever.,S02E25,146
I hate this holiday.,S02E25,147
I've got it.,S02E25,148
-Hey.,S02E25,149
-Hi.,S02E25,150
"Zoey, I'd like you to meet my mom I mean my dad",S02E25,151
"Guys, your costumes are too good.",S02E25,152
-Hi.,S02E25,153
-Hi.,S02E25,154
-Hey.,S02E25,155
-And your costume is blowing my mind.,S02E25,156
"-Right? -Well, I guess.",S02E25,157
"Um, who exactly are you supposed to be?",S02E25,158
My sister.,S02E25,159
She looks like this.,S02E25,160
Wow.,S02E25,161
Now I get it.,S02E25,162
My parents are dressed as each other.,S02E25,163
-Yeah.,S02E25,164
-You remind me a lot of my parents.,S02E25,165
Do they like to have fun too?,S02E25,166
"No, I meant that there are two of them.",S02E25,167
"Well, we should get going.",S02E25,168
-Have fun.,S02E25,169
-Yeah.,S02E25,170
Bye.,S02E25,171
"Wow, she's a spark plug.",S02E25,172
"Hey, Beyonce Emmett's looking better and better.",S02E25,173
"Hey, kiddo, that your second costume?",S02E25,174
It's kinda lame.,S02E25,175
"Yeah, who cares? Second time around is all about volume.",S02E25,176
-What do you want? -I want to show you something.,S02E25,177
What? I didn't do this.,S02E25,178
"Someone did, and I paid you $50 to protect my house.",S02E25,179
But it wasn't me.,S02E25,180
But it will be you cleaning it up.,S02E25,181
Huh! I don't I don't think so.,S02E25,182
Let's take a closer look at the contract you signed.,S02E25,183
Right there.,S02E25,184
"if provider, Gabe Duncan, fails to protect said residence,",S02E25,185
"The provider, Gabe Duncan, agrees to work for Mrs.",S02E25,186
Dabney.,S02E25,187
For one full day work for you doing what?,S02E25,188
-Keep reading.,S02E25,189
-Doing whatever Mrs.,S02E25,190
Dabney tells him to.,S02E25,191
-You tricked me.,S02E25,192
-And that's my treat.,S02E25,193
Oh.,S02E25,194
"-Go ahead, Charlie.",S02E25,195
Go get a piece of candy.,S02E25,196
-Go ahead.,S02E25,197
-Charlie! -I'll get her.,S02E25,198
That was hilarious!,S02E25,199
"No, it wasn't. What is wrong with you?",S02E25,200
What's wrong with you? It's Halloween.,S02E25,201
"Yeah, but scaring a two-year-old isn't funny.",S02E25,202
-It's mean. -She's only two?,S02E25,203
I'm sorry.,S02E25,204
I didn't know.,S02E25,205
"-Here, take some extra candy.",S02E25,206
-Thank you.,S02E25,207
Oh! What?,S02E25,208
"Karl, one; Trick-or-treaters, zero.",S02E25,209
"Oh, what is that horrible smell?",S02E25,210
I added some rotten eggs to the fake blood.,S02E25,211
It's kind of my secret sauce.,S02E25,212
I can't go to a party smelling like this.,S02E25,213
A party? I'm sorry.,S02E25,214
I didn't know.,S02E25,215
Reach into the cauldron.,S02E25,216
There's some perfume in there.,S02E25,217
"Oh, reach into your own cauldron, you clump nugget!",S02E25,218
I hate that Karl kid!,S02E25,219
"I mean, no one would even talk to me at the party.",S02E25,220
Can you blame them? Mary had a little smell.,S02E25,221
We need to teach Karl a lesson.,S02E25,222
"Well, can you teach it from over there? You've still got a little stink on.",S02E25,223
"Ivy,",S02E25,224
I want revenge.,S02E25,225
"Okay, so what's your plan?",S02E25,226
How about this?,S02E25,227
"I get a library card in Karl's name,",S02E25,228
I check out a lot of books.,S02E25,229
And I keep them well past their due dates.,S02E25,230
"Okay, I'm no good at this.",S02E25,231
Help me.,S02E25,232
"Okay, fasten your seat belt.",S02E25,233
Ivy's gonna introduce you to,S02E25,234
the dark side.,S02E25,235
I hate November 1st.,S02E25,236
"Yeah, that's the problem with malted milk balls",S02E25,237
"One's too many and 1,000 aren't enough.",S02E25,238
No more candy ever again.,S02E25,239
-Right after this piece.,S02E25,240
-Nuh-uh.,S02E25,241
That's it.,S02E25,242
I'm throwing the rest out.,S02E25,243
"Ooh, caramel.",S02E25,244
"Hey, everybody.",S02E25,245
"Uh, you do know Halloween's over.",S02E25,246
Why are you still wearing your costume?,S02E25,247
This isn't my costume.,S02E25,248
This is my new look.,S02E25,249
So you weren't in costume last night?,S02E25,250
"Well, sure I was. Hello, fake mustache?",S02E25,251

", you're a goth now? -That's right,.",S02E25,254
"And because I'm the total opposite of what I used to be,",S02E25,255
From now on call me J.,S02E25,256
P.,S02E25,257
"If you're the total opposite,",S02E25,258

Albert who?,S02E25,260
P.,S02E25,261
J.,S02E25,262
", I don't understand.",S02E25,263

-What else you got? -Shave Mr.,S02E25,277

"Here, Kitty Kitty.",S02E25,279
That Cat of yours does not like taking baths.,S02E25,280
I know.,S02E25,281
That's why I had you do it.,S02E25,282
"All right, what what's next?",S02E25,283
You need to give kaboodle his vitamin.,S02E25,284
Is he supposed to swallow this?,S02E25,285
"Oh no, that goes in the other end.",S02E25,286
And if you thought he didn't like baths?,S02E25,287
Ooh!,S02E25,288
"Hey, Zoey and I are going out now.",S02E25,289
Don't wait up.,S02E25,290

She has problems,S02E25,341
Anger problems.,S02E25,342

At 11:00 at night when you could be at home in bed.,S02E25,403
"-I do like to go to bed early. -I know,",S02E25,404
Because you're not a nighttime person.,S02E25,405

Aw.,S02E25,408

"Say, has anyone ever told you.",S02E25,448
You're the bee's knees?,S02E25,449
"Uh, my great-grandfather.",S02E25,450
How would you like to make time with a ghost?,S02E25,451
"Oh, Zeke, that's really flattering,",S02E25,452
"And if I was 90 years older and dead,",S02E25,453
I'd be all over that.,S02E25,454
Since I'm not,S02E25,455
"Next time, a simple note Thank you will suffice.",S02E25,456
"All right, everyone, here's the schedule.",S02E26,0

"Okay, 10:41 a.",S02E26,19
M.,S02E26,20
Mom throws up.,S02E26,21
In Wally walrus trash receptacle.,S02E26,22

Which we'll be riding at 10:39.,S02E26,25
Then I guess this is right.,S02E26,26
"Hey, I don't see patriotic Plaza on this thing.",S02E26,27
I want to see the new founding-fathers exhibit.,S02E26,28

"Oh, man, that's today? I was gonna look for a job.",S02E26,34
"Well, do it tomorrow.",S02E26,35
Today's a big day.,S02E26,36
I want the whole family together.,S02E26,37
"You just want me there for the big-family discount, right?",S02E26,38
- And there's that.,S02E26,39
- Yep.,S02E26,40
"All right, can we move this along?",S02E26,41
I only budgeted three minutes for an argument about dad's pness.,S02E26,42
"Oh, hey, with the time we save, maybe a visit to patriotic a",S02E26,43
We're not going!,S02E26,44
Today's all burnt toast ,S02E26,45
"Running late, and dad jokes",S02E26,46
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S02E26,47
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S02E26,48
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S02E26,49
There it is up on the roof,S02E26,50
"I've been there, I've survived",S02E26,51
So just take my advice,S02E26,52
"Hang in there, baby",S02E26,53

But trust me it comes back around,S02E26,60
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S02E26,61
"Hang in there, baby.",S02E26,62
Can't believe we're finally here.,S02E26,63
All right.,S02E26,64
Time for some family fun.,S02E26,65
Right.,S02E26,66
See ya.,S02E26,67
That frog is staring at you.,S02E26,68

Oh good.,S02E26,79
So you're not just cruising around super adventureland.,S02E26,80
- In a frog costume? - Nope.,S02E26,81
- I'm actually hoppy the frog. - Hoppy?,S02E26,82
"Every time somebody says my name, I have to hop.",S02E26,83
Other than that it's a great job.,S02E26,84
"I just walk around, do a five minutes show once an hour.",S02E26,85
And it pays really well.,S02E26,86
"Oh hey, are there any openings?",S02E26,87
Because I've been trying to save up for a car.,S02E26,88
Actually someone just quit. Want me to see if I can get you in?,S02E26,89
Yeah.,S02E26,90
"Thanks, Emmett.",S02E26,91
That would make me hoppy.,S02E26,92
Would you please stop following me? I am not a giant.,S02E26,93
That was awesome!,S02E26,94
This has been the best day ever.,S02E26,95
What are you doing?,S02E26,96
"Honey, I stood in line for six hours.",S02E26,97
I've been upside down three times.,S02E26,98
I'm sitting.,S02E26,99
All right.,S02E26,100
I want to go on one more ride before we go home.,S02E26,101
I love super adventureland!,S02E26,102

I'm the director of marketing here for super adventureland.,S02E26,106
How would you like to be in a commercial?,S02E26,107
Really? But I'm not an actor.,S02E26,108
"Yeah, no no, we don't want actors.",S02E26,109
We want real kids who really love super adventureland.,S02E26,110
"And if you do it, I could throw in a free one-year pass,",S02E26,111
"Not good on weekends, holidays; rides not included.",S02E26,112
All right.,S02E26,113
Whoa whoa whoa whoa. What's going on?,S02E26,114
"Mom, this guy wants me to be in a commercial for super adventureland.",S02E26,115
Whoa whoa.,S02E26,116
"Slow down, everybody.",S02E26,117
"Okay look, I'm not agreeing to anything.",S02E26,118
"Now I've had some experience in show business,",S02E26,119
And I don't want my son anywhere near it.,S02E26,120
"Oh, that's too bad really,",S02E26,121
Because it was going to be a commercial about the boy and his mother.,S02E26,122
I'll do it.,S02E26,123
"Wait, we'll do it.",S02E26,124
Whatever. Where do I sign?,S02E26,125
Oh.,S02E26,126
"Hey, P.",S02E26,127

"Go on, try it.",S02E26,131
Whoa.,S02E26,132
"Whoa, this is not your mother's meat loaf.",S02E26,133
"I mean, this has got, um um um what's the word?",S02E26,134
- Flavor.,S02E26,135
- Flavor! Yes.,S02E26,136
Mom was working late at the hospital.,S02E26,137
"The ingredients were all here, so I gave it a shot.",S02E26,138
You gave it a shot?,S02E26,139
"Kid, you just hit a home run.",S02E26,140
A home run?,S02E26,141
"Come on, dad, I think you're exaggerating.",S02E26,142
I helped.,S02E26,143
Yes.,S02E26,144
"Yes, you did.",S02E26,145
I did most of the work.,S02E26,146
P.,S02E26,147
J.,S02E26,148
", you you have a real gift.",S02E26,149
"- Hey, you think you can do this again? - Well, I don't know.",S02E26,150
"Because I'm pretty sure your mother's going to be working late again,",S02E26,151
Especially if I call her supervisor.,S02E26,152
"Oh, my brownies are done.",S02E26,153
Brownies?,S02E26,154
Be right back.,S02E26,155
I'm calling the hospital.,S02E26,156
Welcome to the super adventureland family!,S02E26,157
- I got the job? - Hug?,S02E26,158
Answer the question.,S02E26,159
"Yes, you got the job.",S02E26,160
Oh yay!,S02E26,161
You're gonna be playing a princess.,S02E26,162
Ooh! A princess? I like it.,S02E26,163
"Actually we do a little show together, just the two of us.",S02E26,164
Why would they put a princess in a show with a frog?,S02E26,165
Oh yeah.,S02E26,166
"Emmett, please tell me this isn't the story.",S02E26,167
Where the princess kisses the frog and turns him into a prince.,S02E26,168
Eight times a day.,S02E26,169
And nine on sundays.,S02E26,170
Why didn't you tell me I'd have to kiss you?,S02E26,171
I thought it would affect your decision.,S02E26,172
"Well yeah, it totally would affect my decision.",S02E26,173
Is this why the last girl quit?,S02E26,174
Oh yeah.,S02E26,175
"Gabe, they just sent over the script for the commercial.",S02E26,176
"- Cool, let's read it.",S02E26,177
- Okay.,S02E26,178
A boy and his mother.,S02E26,179
Walk through super adventureland.,S02E26,180
"Then I say, I love the new super adventureland.",S02E26,181
The rides are faster and the lines are shorter.,S02E26,182
the mom smiles and nods.,S02E26,183
"Then I say, the new super adventureland is awesome.",S02E26,184
"And I say, and safer too.",S02E26,185
What?,S02E26,186
"What, that's it? That's my only line?",S02E26,187
"Well, mom, the commercial's for kids.",S02E26,188
And kids kind of start zoning out when the adults start talking.,S02E26,189
That is not true. Adults can be very,S02E26,190
Gabe!,S02E26,191
I think we need to make a few changes.,S02E26,192
Wait.,S02E26,193
"Hold on, mom.",S02E26,194
Can we do that?.,S02E26,195
Of course.,S02E26,196
Everyone knows the script is just an outline.,S02E26,197
We'll just make a couple of small tweaks.,S02E26,198
"Hi, I'm Amy Duncan,",S02E26,199
Real-life mother of four.,S02E26,200
"And these days, when your entertainment dollar.",S02E26,201
"Is stretched tighter than a drum,",S02E26,202
It's important to make the right choice for your family's fun.,S02E26,203
"That's why I, Amy Duncan,",S02E26,204
Always choose super adventureland.,S02E26,205
When you're looking to smile{\i0},S02E26,206
Let me give you a hand{\i0},S02E26,207
It's super adventureland.{\i0},S02E26,208
And safer too.,S02E26,209
That is so much better.,S02E26,210
"- Hey, P.",S02E26,211
J.,S02E26,212
"- Hey, dad.",S02E26,213
Whatcha doin'?,S02E26,214
Homework.,S02E26,215
Homework?,S02E26,216
Before dinner? That doesn't sound right.,S02E26,217
"Well, I've got a lot to do.",S02E26,218
"Ah, got it.",S02E26,219
Got it.,S02E26,220
"Whoa whoa whoa, I'm sorry. Did you hear that?",S02E26,221
Hear hear what?,S02E26,222
Tummy's grumbling.,S02E26,223
"You know, what with your mother working late and all",S02E26,224
"Okay, dad, I'd cook something for you,",S02E26,225
But I've really gotta finish.,S02E26,226
Or you could cook.,S02E26,227
And I could do your homework.,S02E26,228
And you know what? I happen to be very good at trigometry.,S02E26,229
It's my second love.,S02E26,230
"Dad, your second love.",S02E26,231
Is pronounced trigonometry.,S02E26,232
"And even if I wanted to cook, we don't have anything to make.",S02E26,233
"Oh, man, I wish I had stopped off at the store on the way home.",S02E26,234
"Oh, wait a minute.",S02E26,235
I did.,S02E26,236
"Okay, come on, you get up there and you start cooking.",S02E26,237
And I will hit the books.,S02E26,238
"- Dad, are you sure about this? - Absolutely.",S02E26,239
Wow.,S02E26,240
"Number and letters, huh?",S02E26,241
It's fun.,S02E26,242
"If you kiss me, I'll turn into a prince.",S02E26,243
The princess wasn't sure what to do.{\i0},S02E26,244
No kidding.,S02E26,245
But at last she decided to kiss the frog.{\i0},S02E26,246
Emmett?,S02E26,247
- You're a prince.,S02E26,248
- You finally noticed.,S02E26,249
I've never felt this way before.,S02E26,250
That's because you've been looking at me like a frog.,S02E26,251
When all along I've really been your prince.,S02E26,252
Whoa!,S02E26,253
I had the craziest dream last night.,S02E26,254
"Well, I'd love to hear about it.",S02E26,255
While you help me fold the boys' undies.,S02E26,256
"Uh, I dreamed that I kissed this guy.",S02E26,257
And I fell instantly in love with him,S02E26,258
A guy that I could never possibly be in love with.,S02E26,259
Is it the guy who delivers our water?,S02E26,260
"My my dream, mom, not yours.",S02E26,261
Batman.,S02E26,262
"Oh, the lone ranger.",S02E26,263
It was Emmett.,S02E26,264
Oh.,S02E26,265
"Well, but that's ridiculous, right?",S02E26,266
I can't possibly be in love with Emmett.,S02E26,267
I've known him since we were kids and he's always been super annoying.,S02E26,268
"I don't know, Teddy.",S02E26,269
Life can be pretty funny.,S02E26,270
"Yeah, but not that funny, right?",S02E26,271
"Okay, I'm gonna tell you a little story.",S02E26,272
"All through school, there was this really annoying kid who liked me.",S02E26,273
And I wanted nothing to do with him.,S02E26,274
Then in High School I agreed to go out with him.,S02E26,275
"After a few dates, we kissed.",S02E26,276
And suddenly everything changed.,S02E26,277
You know who that fellow was?,S02E26,278
Please say Batman.,S02E26,279
- It was your father.,S02E26,280
- No! That's not what I wanted to hear.,S02E26,281
"Well sorry, that's what happened.",S02E26,282
"What, so Emmett might be my true love?",S02E26,283
And future father of your four children.,S02E26,284
Ah!,S02E26,285
Something smells good.,S02E26,286
I'm making chili.,S02E26,287
It'll be ready in a minute.,S02E26,288
Ah. That that all the chili you made?,S02E26,289
"Yeah. It's just the two of us, right?",S02E26,290
Well actually,S02E26,291
It's the five of us.,S02E26,292
"This is Billy, Joe, Barney, and they are mighty hungry.",S02E26,293
Okay.,S02E26,294
Okay.,S02E26,295
"Bobby, Jim, Barbie, could you excuse us?",S02E26,296
- Dad! - What?,S02E26,297
So I'm supposed to magically turn chili for two into chili for five?,S02E26,298
Thank you.,S02E26,299
This is gonna take hours.,S02E26,300
And I have a book report due on wuthering heights.,S02E26,301
Anybody read wuthering heights?,S02E26,302
Anybody see the movie? Barney.,S02E26,303
You got a book report due.,S02E26,304
I need five pages by dessert.,S02E26,305
"Bob Duncan, you are so lucky I bought extra beans.",S02E26,306
"I'm ready for my close-up, Mr.",S02E26,307
Flufferman.,S02E26,308
"Yeah, about that, I got your email,",S02E26,309
Saw that you made some changes to the script.,S02E26,310
- You're welcome.,S02E26,311
- Yeah.,S02E26,312
Actually we also made some changes some casting changes.,S02E26,313
- What? - Oh.,S02E26,314
"Oh, give me a minute.",S02E26,315
"Gabe, honey, they're replacing you.",S02E26,316
"Oh, no.",S02E26,317
No no no no.,S02E26,318
"No, we're not replacing him.",S02E26,319
We're replacing you.,S02E26,320
What? Me?,S02E26,321
Me?,S02E26,322
I'm the star of the commercial.,S02E26,323
"Uh, you may be the star of your commercial.",S02E26,324
He's the star of our commercial.,S02E26,325
"Go easy on her, Danny.",S02E26,326
She means well.,S02E26,327
"Well, good luck finding someone.",S02E26,328
Who can replace this.,S02E26,329
"Um, hey, you speak English?",S02E26,330
- Yes.,S02E26,331
- You've been replaced.,S02E26,332
"Wow, you actually look more like my mom than she does.",S02E26,333
Okay.,S02E26,334
Come on in.,S02E26,335
Is something wrong?,S02E26,336
Why would you think something's wrong?,S02E26,337
'Cause you called and invited me over.,S02E26,338
You've never done that before.,S02E26,339
Why don't you have a seat?,S02E26,340
"Oh no, something is wrong.",S02E26,341
Okay.,S02E26,342
"So, um, here's the thing.",S02E26,343
I had a dream.,S02E26,344
And you were in it.,S02E26,345
And your glasses are fogging up so,S02E26,346
"Anyway, in in the dream,",S02E26,347
We kissed.,S02E26,348
And it was a good kiss.,S02E26,349
There go your glasses again.,S02E26,350
"Anyway, I thought.",S02E26,351
"Since we have to kiss in the show,",S02E26,352
Maybe it might be a good idea if we kiss here first.,S02E26,353
"You know, like a like a rehearsal.",S02E26,354
That way we can find out if it means anything.,S02E26,355
What are you doing?,S02E26,356
Trying to say okay.,S02E26,357
"All right, okay.",S02E26,358
"Well, let's get this over with then.",S02E26,359
I can't believe this is really happening.,S02E26,360
I've been dreaming about this since I was nine years old.,S02E26,361
I'm really gonna kiss Teddy Duncan.,S02E26,362
And it's gonna be perfect.,S02E26,363
Here goes nothing.,S02E26,364
- Wait. - What?,S02E26,365
What if it isn't?,S02E26,366
- What if what isn't? - The kiss what if it isn't perfect?,S02E26,367
"Well, then we'll know that there's nothing between us.",S02E26,368
- Now pucker up.,S02E26,369
"- No, Teddy.",S02E26,370
"If the kiss isn't perfect, I lose my dream.",S02E26,371
"Less yakking, more smacking.",S02E26,372
No no no! I'm not gonna kiss you.,S02E26,373
Yes you are! I need to know.,S02E26,374
And I need to not know.,S02E26,375
- Kiss me! - No! Leave me alone!,S02E26,376
"Well, you're gonna have to kiss me at work.",S02E26,377
- No I won't.,S02E26,378
I quit.,S02E26,379
- Ah!.,S02E26,380
"Get back here and kiss me, you little wimp!",S02E26,381
"Hi, Mrs.",S02E26,382

Walking.,S02E26,392
"Okay, we said that you could be an extra.",S02E26,393
"And that means you walk, all right? And not in place.",S02E26,394
"Okay, everybody back to one.",S02E26,395
Let's go.,S02E26,396
From the top.,S02E26,397
Here we go.,S02E26,398
And action.,S02E26,399

Great news I am getting an F,S02E26,425
In trigometry.,S02E26,426

Nine pounds.,S02E26,438
We gotta get back to the way it was.,S02E26,439
When you were slim and I was getting solid Ds.,S02E26,440
I guess you're right.,S02E26,441
"Charlie, can you cook for daddy?",S02E26,442
"No, daddy.",S02E26,443
Oh hi.,S02E26,444
Hi.,S02E26,445

And kissing together.,S02E26,449
I'm so glad they brought someone new in here.,S02E26,450
Things got kind of complicated with the old frog.,S02E26,451
"So with you and me, it's gonna be nice and simple.",S02E26,452
"Hey, Teddy.",S02E26,453
Spencer?,S02E26,454
"Aw, you gotta be kidding me.",S02E26,455
"Well, Charlie, it's been a strange week.",S02E26,456
"Um, I had a dream that my frog was a prince.",S02E26,457
And then my ex-prince showed up as a frog.,S02E26,458
And now I have to kiss him over and over.,S02E26,459
Stay tuned.,S02E26,460
"Hey, mom, what you doin'?",S02E26,461
Just walking.,S02E26,462
In place?,S02E26,463
Don't you ever do that?,S02E26,464
Keep moving.,S02E26,465
Go on.,S02E26,466
"Well, that's our mom.",S02E26,467
She sees a camera and she can't help herself.,S02E26,468
"Good luck, Charlie.",S02E26,469
And how.,S02E26,470
"Hey, what is that thing?",S02E26,471
I bought it at the super adventureland gift shop.,S02E26,472
- It's a time machine.,S02E26,473
"- Oh, for heaven's sakes, Bob.",S02E26,474
Why would you waste your money on something as stupid as that?,S02E26,475
"The guy said it works. Hey, you know what?",S02E26,476
I'm gonna set it back for a couple of days ago.,S02E26,477
"All right, everyone, here's the schedule.",S02E26,478

"Ok people, P.",S02E27,0
J.,S02E27,1
's birthday is this Saturday.,S02E27,2
And everyone needs to buy him a present.,S02E27,3
"And by everyone, I mean Gabe.",S02E27,4
"And by buy him a present, she means actually purchase one.",S02E27,5
Not borrow or steal it.,S02E27,6
Why are you guys peeking on me.,S02E27,7
I always get P.,S02E27,8
J.,S02E27,9
a present.,S02E27,10
"Last year, you wrapped up one of his shirts and gave it to him.",S02E27,11
And he loved it.,S02E27,12
I can't believe my baby boy is turning 18.,S02E27,13
"Hey guys, what're you talking about?",S02E27,14
Nothing!,S02E27,15
What are you whistling about?,S02E27,16
Not my birthday.,S02E27,17
That's for sure.,S02E27,18
Hey P.,S02E27,19
J.,S02E27,20
", how would you like a pair of pants exactly like those?.",S02E27,21
Oh man!,S02E27,22
Teddy. Are you ok?,S02E27,23
I'm just bummed out that I have to kiss Spencer.,S02E27,24
Your ex-boyfriend Spencer? The one who cheated on you?,S02E27,25
"No, dad, the other Spencer in my life.",S02E27,26
"Well, why would you want to kiss that guy?",S02E27,27
Because I need a car.,S02E27,28
Tell him more.,S02E27,29
He's lost.,S02E27,30
"Ok, I've got a new job at Super Adventure Land.",S02E27,31
"I have to play the princess, princess has to kiss to frog and the frog is",S02E27,32
Spencer.,S02E27,33
"Teddy honey, I feel for you.",S02E27,34
I know how uncomfortable it is to kiss your ex.,S02E27,35
I remember this one time in college,S02E27,36
Today's all burnt toast ,S02E27,37
"Running late, and dad jokes",S02E27,38
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S02E27,39
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S02E27,40
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S02E27,41
There it is up on the roof,S02E27,42
"I've been there, I've survived",S02E27,43
So just take my advice,S02E27,44
"Hang in there, baby",S02E27,45
Things are crazy,S02E27,46
But I know your future's bright,S02E27,47
"Hang in there, baby",S02E27,48
There's no maybe,S02E27,49
Everything turns out all right,S02E27,50
Sure life is up and down,S02E27,51
But trust me it comes back around,S02E27,52
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S02E27,53
"Hang in there, baby.",S02E27,54
Charlie.,S02E27,55
Did you do something with daddy's can.,S02E27,56
No daddy.,S02E27,57
Well did you see where it went?,S02E27,58
It's a secret.,S02E27,59
"Well, do you want to tell daddy the secret?",S02E27,60
Gabe.,S02E27,61
That's why you are my favorite.,S02E27,62
Gabe.,S02E27,63
Did you just steal my can.,S02E27,64
Can? I don't know anything about the can.,S02E27,65
Step away from the cabin.,S02E27,66
"No, no, dad.",S02E27,67
"-Come on.  -Dad, I really don't think you want to",S02E27,68
do that.,S02E27,69
What's going on?,S02E27,70
I'm recycling.,S02E27,71
-No kid.,S02E27,72
-Yeah.,S02E27,73
I'm I'm concerned about the environment.,S02E27,74
I'm gonna be on this planet for a really long time.,S02E27,75
"Now you, you've got nothing to worry about.",S02E27,76
"So, all this sudden interest in recycling",S02E27,77
has nothing to do with the fact that maybe,S02E27,78
you think you can make a little money off it.,S02E27,79
"Ahh, is that right?",S02E27,80
I did not know that.,S02E27,81
"Well, here's something else you don't seem to know,",S02E27,82
"In the state of Colorado, they don't give you money for aluminum cans.",S02E27,83
"Oh, yeah, I knew that.",S02E27,84
"Oh, dad, by the way, can you give me a ride?",S02E27,85
"Sure, where to?",S02E27,86
Kansas.,S02E27,87
"Hey mom, guess what? I join Spanish club.",S02E27,88
Is it about taking a school trip or meeting girls.,S02E27,89
It's about taking a trip,S02E27,90
with girls or as we say in Spanish: con-girls.,S02E27,91
Anyway I may need a passport to go to Mexico so I need my birth certificate.,S02E27,92
-You need your birth certificate.,S02E27,93
-Yes.,S02E27,94
"You got it, right?.",S02E27,95
Yeah,S02E27,96
It's,S02E27,97
It's in my files.,S02E27,98
I will take it out for you.,S02E27,99
-Thanks.,S02E27,100
"-Yeah, no problem.",S02E27,101
"Bob, it finally happened.",S02E27,102
P.,S02E27,103
J.,S02E27,104
wants to see his birth certificate.,S02E27,105
We knew this day would come.,S02E27,106
"Oh, stop whimpering and man up!",S02E27,107
Hey!,S02E27,108
Hey.,S02E27,109
"So, today is the day of the big kiss. Huh?",S02E27,110
"Yeah, it's so.",S02E27,111
You look great in that outfit.,S02E27,112
"Oh, I know.",S02E27,113
I mean thanks.,S02E27,114
"Look! Spencer, there is no reason why it has to be awkward.",S02E27,115
Well It's not you and I kissing.,S02E27,116
It's just our characters.,S02E27,117
I mean we're professionals.,S02E27,118
Right?.,S02E27,119
You are right. I'm as professional as a guy in,S02E27,120
frog suit making minimum wage it can be.,S02E27,121
"Well, that's our cue.",S02E27,122
See you out there.,S02E27,123
And when their joyous dance came to an end.,S02E27,124
The prince and the princess seal their love with a kiss.,S02E27,125
"Wait, Teddy.",S02E27,126
And the prince and the princess walk off together and live happily ever after.,S02E27,127
"Bob, you had 18 years to change P.",S02E27,128
J.,S02E27,129
's birth certificate.,S02E27,130
Why didn't you?,S02E27,131
"For once, can we not play the blaming game.",S02E27,132
It's the only game we know.,S02E27,133
"Ok, look.",S02E27,134
There is a there is a very simple solution.,S02E27,135
We'll just tell P.,S02E27,136
J.,S02E27,137
we can't afford to send him to Mexico.,S02E27,138
You want me to lie to him?,S02E27,139
I'm in.,S02E27,140
Hola padre.,S02E27,141
Hola madre.,S02E27,142
Hola Sr.,S02E27,143
and Sra.,S02E27,144
Duncan.,S02E27,145
Hola Emmett. Cómo estás?,S02E27,146
What's she saying?,S02E27,147
I have no idea.,S02E27,148
P.,S02E27,149
J.,S02E27,150
", hey.",S02E27,151
"Eh, listen.",S02E27,152
"Look, we've got some bad news about the trip",S02E27,153
which is heartbreaking considering how well you're doing with the Spanish.,S02E27,154
Honey.,S02E27,155
We can't afford to pay for your trip to Mexico.,S02E27,156
I'm so sorry.,S02E27,157
"Actually, the Spanish club is having fund raised all year.",S02E27,158
The trip is paid for.,S02E27,159
Yeah.,S02E27,160
"no cost of a dime, it's a free trip to our neighbour to the north.",S02E27,161
It's south.,S02E27,162
"Umm, not on the way back.",S02E27,163
Spencer.,S02E27,164
"Hey, eh. Can we talk?",S02E27,165
"I eh, just want to make sure you are ok.",S02E27,166
Well I'm not ok.,S02E27,167
"Teddy, I felt terrible about this, alright?",S02E27,168
You are in the job first,S02E27,169
and kissing me makes you feel that bad then I'm just going to quit.,S02E27,170
"No, Spencer.",S02E27,171
It's not that the kiss was bad.,S02E27,172
It's the kiss was.,S02E27,173
Good.,S02E27,174
Ohh.,S02E27,175
You know.,S02E27,176
I didn't I didn't want it to be good.,S02E27,177
"In fact, I was all prepared to be disgusted.",S02E27,178
Thanks.,S02E27,179
Now I don't know what to do.,S02E27,180
Teddy,S02E27,181
Hurting you was the stupidest thing I've did.,S02E27,182
Could you please give me another chance?,S02E27,183
Did you notice that every time we kiss balloons appear?,S02E27,184
It was good to see them too.,S02E27,185
"Come on Charllie, say it.",S02E27,186
I love you!,S02E27,187
"Isn't that adorable, grandma?",S02E27,188
"Yes, she made me call just so she could tell you that.",S02E27,189
"Hey listen, grandma.",S02E27,190
While I got you on the horn a thought occured to me.,S02E27,191
Every year you send me a Christmas check for 50$.,S02E27,192
And you know what? I'm thinking about it.,S02E27,193
Won't it be easier for you to send me the next 10 checks for all at once?,S02E27,194
"You know, like a prepay plan.",S02E27,195
-Gabe!  -Got to go.,S02E27,196
"Ok, out with it.",S02E27,197
What do you try to get this money for?,S02E27,198
Alright.,S02E27,199
The truth is I want the ZCube 6.,S02E27,200
A new game system? I just got you the ZCube 5 last year.,S02E27,201
"Yeah, last year!",S02E27,202
It doesn't even have 3D graphics.,S02E27,203
I might have used it as a food store.,S02E27,204
"Ok, you are gonna have to find another way to make money",S02E27,205
without shaking down your relatives.,S02E27,206
Hello.,S02E27,207
"Oh, hey Aunt Diane.",S02E27,208
"Yeah, thanks for calling back.",S02E27,209
"Oh, what did I want?",S02E27,210
"Eh, eh just just say I I love ya.",S02E27,211
See what you're making me do.,S02E27,212
"Eh, P.",S02E27,213
J.,S02E27,214
There is something I need to tell you.,S02E27,215
"Now before I say anything,",S02E27,216
I just want you to know your mother and I would love you very much.,S02E27,217
That doesn't sound good. What's going on?,S02E27,218
P.,S02E27,219
J.,S02E27,220
", we've been keeping a secret from you.",S02E27,221
-What is it?  -It's about your name.,S02E27,222
"As you know, you were named after your great grandfather Patrick John.",S02E27,223
"Yeah, they gave and usually called me Patty John.",S02E27,224
"Yeah, yeah, ok, here is what you don't know.",S02E27,225
"Uhm, when you were born,",S02E27,226
I filled out the papers and I was really nervous and,S02E27,227
I-I-I think my hand was shaking a little and here.,S02E27,228
That is your legal birth certificate.,S02E27,229
That's what P.,S02E27,230
J.,S02E27,231
stands for.,S02E27,232
I'm afraid so.,S02E27,233
My name is Potty John.,S02E27,234
"Legally, yes!",S02E27,235
Potty John.,S02E27,236
I'm named after two toilets.,S02E27,237
"Legally, yeah!",S02E27,238
And you never bother to fix this.,S02E27,239
But we always meant to.,S02E27,240
"I just, we just never got around to it.",S02E27,241
Kinda like the upstairs potty huh?,S02E27,242
Too soon?,S02E27,243
So your dad and I were talking and,S02E27,244
we felt really bad that you have to go to work every day,S02E27,245
and kiss that horrible Spencer.,S02E27,246
Yeah.,S02E27,247
Horrible is kinda a strong word.,S02E27,248
"Anyway, since the only reason you're doing this is to get money for a car.",S02E27,249
Well,S02E27,250
Come with me.,S02E27,251
Tada!,S02E27,252
-Ooh.,S02E27,253
What's this?  -It's your new car.,S02E27,254
Shut up!,S02E27,255
One of the other nurses was selling it and I got a great price.,S02E27,256
Now it's all yours.,S02E27,257
Aww! I don't know what to say. Thank you thank you,S02E27,258
Get in.,S02E27,259
And the best part is now you can quit your job,S02E27,260
so that you never have to go near that jerk Spencer ever again.,S02E27,261
Yay.,S02E27,262
You should give it a name.,S02E27,263
Oh I know. How about the Now I don't have to kiss Spencer anymore mobile?,S02E27,264
Or Ed.,S02E27,265
I kinda like Ed.,S02E27,266
Come on in guys.,S02E27,267
Right this way.,S02E27,268
The fun begins in a minute.,S02E27,269
"-Err, Gabe.",S02E27,270
-Yep.,S02E27,271
Who're these kids.,S02E27,272
I've never seen them before.,S02E27,273
You've never seen them,S02E27,274
because these are the kids who never get invited anywhere.,S02E27,275
"Ok, so why are they here.",S02E27,276
What's in it for you.,S02E27,277
The satisfaction of bringing joy to a few sad misfits.,S02E27,278
Excuse me!,S02E27,279
Yes!,S02E27,280
Do I give you the twenty dollars now or when the play date is over?,S02E27,281
-Now is good.,S02E27,282
-Awesome.,S02E27,283
Gabe.,S02E27,284
Did you see the smile on the little scamp's face.,S02E27,285
"Mom, I had the craziest dream last night.",S02E27,286
"Ooh, me too.",S02E27,287
I was in high school.,S02E27,288
Only I had wings and all the cheerleaders were really jealous,S02E27,289
because I kept flying around during our routine.,S02E27,290
"Then out of nowhere, Lady Gaga appeares throwing her shoe at me.",S02E27,291
"Ok mom, can we stay on me.",S02E27,292
"Anyway, in my crazy dream,",S02E27,293
Spencer and I got back together.,S02E27,294
And then you guys found out and you took my car away.,S02E27,295
Oh duh.,S02E27,296
"You know Teddy, my dream is a lot more entertaining than yours.",S02E27,297
"Mom, I have to tell you something.",S02E27,298
Did you know that this car has a satellite radio?,S02E27,299
-It does?  -Uh-huh.,S02E27,300
Over 100 stations.,S02E27,301
You were saying?,S02E27,302
"Right, right, ok.",S02E27,303
Here is the thing.,S02E27,304
I.,S02E27,305
Is that the mp3 hookup?,S02E27,306
This baby is fully loaded.,S02E27,307
Oh men.,S02E27,308
You are not making this easier.,S02E27,309
"Speaking of making things easier, ba-bam, your very own gas card.",S02E27,310
Huh.,S02E27,311
"And, so you don't get lost.",S02E27,312
"Ba-bam, your very own GPS.",S02E27,313
Now what was that you wanted to tell me?,S02E27,314
"Mom, I want to tell you that I'm in love",S02E27,315
with Ed.,S02E27,316
"Alright, this is from Gabe.",S02E27,317
A 10-dollar gift card for frozen yogurt.,S02E27,318
Probably about 6 dollars left on it.,S02E27,319
I was feeling snacky!,S02E27,320
"Ok, here is mine.",S02E27,321
It's a journal for your trip to Mexico.,S02E27,322
"Everyday you can write what you did, what you saw, how you felt about it.",S02E27,323
"-Aw, I love it.",S02E27,324
-Yeah.,S02E27,325
You'll never get a gift secret for decision?,S02E27,326
No.,S02E27,327
Okay.,S02E27,328
Here is a little something from mom and dad.,S02E27,329
"Oh, wow, guys.",S02E27,330
This is so generous.,S02E27,331
Just a little spending money for Mexico.,S02E27,332
Enjoy your dinaro.,S02E27,333
"Oh, do I have to spend it on dinaro.",S02E27,334
Can I use it for breakfast-o or lunch-o?,S02E27,335
"Sweetie, when you're down there, stay close to the teacher.",S02E27,336
There is one more thing we got you.,S02E27,337
Went down to the court house this morning.,S02E27,338
Finally got your birth certificate fixed.,S02E27,339
You are now officially P.,S02E27,340
J.,S02E27,341
Duncan.,S02E27,342
"Dad, did you double check this.",S02E27,343
"No! Why, how can anybody possibly mess up P.",S02E27,344
J.,S02E27,345
Don't ask me.,S02E27,346
According to this my name is PP Duncan.,S02E27,347
"Turn out, it's not looking so bad now, is it?",S02E27,348
"Well, looks like that's all the presents. PP, happy birthday!!",S02E27,349
"Oh wait, wait.",S02E27,350
There's one left.,S02E27,351
It says it's from Charlie.,S02E27,352
Charlie! You don't have to give me anything.,S02E27,353
What? A new guitar!,S02E27,354
This is just what I wanted. How do you guys know?,S02E27,355
Did you do that?,S02E27,356
Awww.,S02E27,357
It's so cool.,S02E27,358
Hey Gabe.,S02E27,359
How are you liking that new ZCube?,S02E27,360
"Oh, I decided not to get it, the ZCube 7's coming out soon.",S02E27,361
You used that money to buy that new guitar for your bro.,S02E27,362
I don't know what you're talking about.,S02E27,363
Oh come on Gabe.,S02E27,364
If you tell anybody about this I will never forgive you.,S02E27,365
Why would you want to keep that a secret?,S02E27,366
Because,S02E27,367
I can't let people think that I've gone soft or that I love my brother.,S02E27,368
Alright alright.,S02E27,369
Your secret is safe with me.,S02E27,370
I'm proud of you.,S02E27,371
You're a good kid.,S02E27,372
See! That's the exact kind of talk I was afraid of.,S02E27,373
Hey guys.,S02E27,374
-Hey.,S02E27,375
-Hi honey.,S02E27,376
There are the keys dad.,S02E27,377
I'm giving em back.,S02E27,378
What? Why?,S02E27,379
Oh because you're gonna taking him back anyway.,S02E27,380
Why would we do that?,S02E27,381
There is a secret that I've been keeping from you guys.,S02E27,382
Come on in.,S02E27,383
Hi Mr.,S02E27,384
and Mrs.,S02E27,385
Duncan.,S02E27,386
Spencer and I are dating again.,S02E27,387
"Ok, at first I didn't want to tell you guys",S02E27,388
because I was afraid that you would take away the car.,S02E27,389
I figured that I had a choice to make either Ed,S02E27,390
or Spencer so after thinking about it for a long time.,S02E27,391
A really long time.,S02E27,392
I chose Spencer.,S02E27,393
I decided to give him another chance.,S02E27,394
"So, we're back together now and I'm very happy.",S02E27,395
Well.,S02E27,396
I'm just glad that you could be honest with us.,S02E27,397
And.,S02E27,398
If you're happy I guess that's all that really matter.,S02E27,399
Thanks.,S02E27,400
You're letting me keep the car.,S02E27,401
We're letting you pay for the car.,S02E27,402
With the job that you're going to keep.,S02E27,403
Fair enough.,S02E27,404
Welcome back to the family Spencer.,S02E27,405
And if you ever,S02E27,406
hurt my little girl again,S02E27,407
Ba-Bam.,S02E27,408
"Hey Charlie, so, big news.",S02E27,409
This week I got a new old boyfriend named Spencer,S02E27,410
and an old new car named Ed.,S02E27,411
"And someday if I take good care of him, you could have him.",S02E27,412
"Oh Ed, not Spencer.",S02E27,413
That would be just weird.,S02E27,414
Excuse me!,S02E27,415
Who are you?,S02E27,416
I'm Eliot.,S02E27,417
I paid Gabe for another play date for playing hide and seek.,S02E27,418
But I've been hiding for almost 5 hours.,S02E27,419
He went to baseball practice.,S02E27,420
"Oh, I'll wait.",S02E27,421
"Well, I guess there's only one thing left to say.",S02E27,422
"Oh hey, you are here why don't you say it?",S02E27,423
Good luck Charlie.,S02E27,424
Teddy!,S02E27,425
Who said that?,S02E27,426
"It's me, your car.",S02E27,427
"Ed, you can talk?",S02E27,428
I prefer Edward.,S02E27,429
And yes.,S02E27,430
"Huh, so I have a talking car?",S02E27,431
Oh does that mean we're going on an adventure and solve crimes and stuff.,S02E27,432
"Well, that sounds kind of dangerous",S02E27,433
I've thought we'd just drive carefully and stay within speed limit and stuff.,S02E27,434
Oh man.,S02E27,435
So I have a talking car who's boring.,S02E27,436
"Oh uh, one other thing I have to tell you.",S02E27,437
I don't feel so good.,S02E27,438
"Edward, Edward talk to me.",S02E27,439
Gotcha.,S02E27,440
"Not so boring now, am I?",S02E27,441
"Hey, dad, you gonna eat your last piece of bacon?",S02E28,0
Nice.,S02E28,1
"Oh, dad, by the way I'm having career day at my school,",S02E28,2
And I was wondering if you could come.,S02E28,3
Really? You want me to come in and talk about my job?,S02E28,4
- That's fantastic.,S02E28,5
"- Easy, big guy.",S02E28,6
You're a time filler.,S02E28,7
"Nothing more, nothing less.",S02E28,8
That's a little less fantastic.,S02E28,9
"Hey, how come I never came in and spoke to one of your classes?",S02E28,10
We didn't have career day back then.,S02E28,11
It's a whole new idea.,S02E28,12
Really? They had career day when I was a kid.,S02E28,13
Must have skipped a generation.,S02E28,14
"Hey, Gabe.",S02E28,15
Why aren't you asking me to career day this year?,S02E28,16
Because of what happened last year.,S02E28,17
We see a lot of interesting things in the emergency room.,S02E28,18
This is what can happen when you don't follow the directions.,S02E28,19
On the chainsaw.,S02E28,20
"Kids, kids, hold your reactions till the end.",S02E28,21
We've got a lot of pictures here.,S02E28,22
So now severed limbs are off-limits to 11-year-olds?,S02E28,23
What?,S02E28,24
Today's all burnt toast ,S02E28,25
"Running late, and dad jokes",S02E28,26
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S02E28,27
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S02E28,28
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S02E28,29
There it is up on the roof,S02E28,30
"I've been there, I've survived",S02E28,31
So just take my advice,S02E28,32
"Hang in there, baby",S02E28,33
Things are crazy,S02E28,34
But I know your future's bright,S02E28,35
"Hang in there, baby",S02E28,36
There's no maybe,S02E28,37
Everything turns out all right,S02E28,38
Your life is up and down,S02E28,39
But trust me it comes back around,S02E28,40
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S02E28,41
"Hang in there, baby.",S02E28,42
"'And cheesy,  the sad little pizza said,",S02E28,43
'I just feel so plain.',S02E28,44
"And pepe, his friend the pepperoni pizza said,{\i0}",S02E28,45
"'but, cheesy, that's why kids love you.'",S02E28,46
And cheesy felt all better.{\i0},S02E28,47
The end.,S02E28,48
Mom.,S02E28,49
"Candace, thank you so much for this story, we really enjoyed it.",S02E28,50
I heard you snoring.,S02E28,51
"The important thing is Charlie liked, right Charlie?",S02E28,52
"No, mommy.",S02E28,53
She's right.,S02E28,54
It was not a good book.,S02E28,55
I could write a better story than that.,S02E28,56
I wish you would. I working in children's Publishing,S02E28,57
And I am always on the look out for new talent.,S02E28,58
"Anyway, we'll see you guys next week.",S02E28,59
"- Bye, Candace.",S02E28,60
- See ya.,S02E28,61
- That gives me an idea.,S02E28,62
- Me too.,S02E28,63
I should write a children's book!,S02E28,64
What do you know about writing?,S02E28,65
What do you know about children?,S02E28,66
Maybe we could write a book together.,S02E28,67
And then we could read it at next week's story time.,S02E28,68
"And the kids will go crazy. Candace will publish it,",S02E28,69
And I'll be on good morning Denver.,S02E28,70
Right now let's just focus on writing a good story for the kids.,S02E28,71
You're right.,S02E28,72
You're right.,S02E28,73
It's all about the kids.,S02E28,74
"Oh, great.",S02E28,75
I guess dinner's here.,S02E28,76
And a happy kwikki chikki hello to you.,S02E28,77
"- I heard that, Scott.",S02E28,78
"- I'm sure that you heard, but when I ask.",S02E28,79
"For a home-cooked meal, you suddenly go deaf.",S02E28,80
I'm not a housewife.,S02E28,81
I work too.,S02E28,82
Do you want me to come back later?,S02E28,83
"No, then the food will be cold.",S02E28,84
Don't worry.,S02E28,85
It's already cold.,S02E28,86
Let's ask this guy. What do you think?,S02E28,87
"Come on, we want your opinion.",S02E28,88
Who is responsible for dinner?,S02E28,89
That is a tough question. I've seen my parents have the very same argument,S02E28,90
'cause they both have jobs too.,S02E28,91
- How do they work it out? - Very loudly.,S02E28,92
"But at least they're communicating,",S02E28,93
Which is maybe what you guys need to do.,S02E28,94
But we are communicating.,S02E28,95
Are you? Are you really?,S02E28,96
"No, we're not.",S02E28,97
Maybe it's time to start.,S02E28,98
I just want things to go back to the way they were when we first got married.,S02E28,99
I want that too.,S02E28,100
"I'm sorry, honey.",S02E28,101
I'm sorry too.,S02E28,102
"Well, I guess there's only one thing left to say.",S02E28,103
That'll be $14.,S02E28,104
95.,S02E28,105
"Okay, tell me what you think of this.",S02E28,106
"actress, singer, dancer, comedian, entertainer, nurse,",S02E28,107
"Wife, mother of four, Amy Duncan now adds author.",S02E28,108
To her long list of credits.,S02E28,109
What is that?,S02E28,110
It's my bio for the book jacket.,S02E28,111
Too long?,S02E28,112
'cause I could lose wife and mother of four.,S02E28,113
"Hey, I have an idea.",S02E28,114
"Instead of a book jacket, let's write a book.",S02E28,115
"Okay, seems kind of backwards to me, but okay, sure.",S02E28,116
Let's just brainstorm and see what we come up with.,S02E28,117
Excellent idea.,S02E28,118
Brainstorming.,S02E28,119
Stormy brain.,S02E28,120
"Thinking, thoughts, ideas, words",S02E28,121
"Mom, brainstorms are usually quiet.",S02E28,122
Sorry.,S02E28,123
"And remember, an idea can come from anywhere.",S02E28,124
- Got it! - What?,S02E28,125
Trashy.,S02E28,126
Trashy?,S02E28,127
Trashy the trash can.,S02E28,128
I was staring at the trash can and it just came to me.,S02E28,129
"Okay, trashy.",S02E28,130
So what's his story?,S02E28,131
"Teddy, I can't do all the work.",S02E28,132
I came up with trashy.,S02E28,133
"Yeah, but what's he trying to teach the kids?",S02E28,134
"Oh, okay.",S02E28,135
"Um, well, when trashy.",S02E28,136
"Sees someone litter,",S02E28,137
"He says, enh-enh-enh-enh.",S02E28,138
I do that really well.,S02E28,139
I should do hjs voice for the movie.,S02E28,140
"Hey, mom, let's think of some other ideas.",S02E28,141
Really?,S02E28,142
'cause I'm loving me some trashy.,S02E28,143
"Okay okay, well, maybe we should work separately,",S02E28,144
Then get together tomorrow with some new ideas.,S02E28,145
That aren't based off of the first thing you looked at.,S02E28,146
- Fine.,S02E28,147
- Good.,S02E28,148
- Whatever.,S02E28,149
- Great.,S02E28,150
Enh-enh-enh.,S02E28,151
I can see it on a t-shirt.,S02E28,152
"Okay, dad, career day is tomorrow.",S02E28,153
What's your plan?,S02E28,154
- My plan? - Yeah.,S02E28,155
To wing it.,S02E28,156
"Dad, this isn't a toast to mom on your anniversary.",S02E28,157
This is important.,S02E28,158
Now you can't just get up there and talk aboutour job.,S02E28,159
You gotta put on a show.,S02E28,160
"This is all about the sizzle, not the steak.",S02E28,161
I get it.,S02E28,162
"You want me to bring in a couple of critters that I caught,",S02E28,163
Like a rat or a possum.,S02E28,164
"Is there any chance you could catch something exciting,",S02E28,165
Like an alligator or a lion.,S02E28,166
Or a polar bear? Yeah.,S02E28,167
"Well, those might be tough since career day is tomorrow.",S02E28,168
And we live in Denver.,S02E28,169
"All right, dad, whatever you do,",S02E28,170
Just don't embarrass me.,S02E28,171
That means shirt tucked in and your most dependable belt.,S02E28,172
"Hey, that's not gonna happen again.",S02E28,173
"Man, you ruin one little league game",S02E28,174
Hi again.,S02E28,175
"Ooh, something smells good.",S02E28,176
- I'm making pork chops. - Then why'd you order chicken?,S02E28,177
"Actually, we were hoping you could help us with another problem.",S02E28,178
"Oh, well, come on out.",S02E28,179
"Have a seat, make yourselves at home.",S02E28,180
Talk to me.,S02E28,181
The thing is Christine's mother wants to come and stay with us.,S02E28,182
For two weeks.,S02E28,183
"I wanted to ask her to come for less time,",S02E28,184
But,S02E28,185
But what?,S02E28,186
"Come on, tell the chicken guy.",S02E28,187
- But I'm afraid of her.,S02E28,188
"There, I said it.",S02E28,189
"- Yeah, but just because.",S02E28,190
Hold on.,S02E28,191
We're working with Christine now.,S02E28,192
"Now, Christine, how did that make you feel?",S02E28,193
"Well, it makes me feel sad, and I want Scott",S02E28,194
"- Scott, feedback. - I feel that I'd like to help Christine,",S02E28,195
- So she wouldn't be so sad.- How can you help?,S02E28,196
Well but you asked me.,S02E28,197
Don't question my process.,S02E28,198
I'll tell you how you can help.,S02E28,199
Date night.,S02E28,200
- Date night.,S02E28,201
"- Yeah, make sure you guys schedule some alone time.",S02E28,202
While your mother's here.,S02E28,203
Your needs are important too.,S02E28,204
- Date night.,S02E28,205
That's a great idea.,S02E28,206
- Yeah.,S02E28,207
Thank you so much.,S02E28,208
"Hey, it's what I do.",S02E28,209
Now let's take a look at those pork chops.,S02E28,210
"Now before we share our book ideas,",S02E28,211
Let's remember to be kind.,S02E28,212
That's right.,S02E28,213
There are no bad ideas.,S02E28,214
I'll go first.,S02E28,215
Ba-bam!,S02E28,216
"Hey, trashy's back.",S02E28,217
I know.,S02E28,218
"Try as I might, I could not top him.",S02E28,219
Can I share one of my ideas now?,S02E28,220
"Y-yeah, of course.",S02E28,221
Go ahead.,S02E28,222
Okay.,S02E28,223
So my idea is a story.,S02E28,224
About a little tin can and his name is,S02E28,225
Tim can.,S02E28,226
So the story begins with Tim on the shelf at the store.,S02E28,227
Then he goes on some amazing adventures.,S02E28,228
That teach kids all about recycling. What do you think?,S02E28,229
I think I was wrong.,S02E28,230
There are bad ideas.,S02E28,231
"Honey, don't get too down on yourself.",S02E28,232
I set the bar pretty high with trashy.,S02E28,233
Are you kidding? You just you pointed at a trash can.,S02E28,234
And gave it a stupid name.,S02E28,235
I could do that.,S02E28,236
Let's write a story about tabley or blendery.,S02E28,237
"Blendery? Okay, that's just silly.",S02E28,238
What would a blender say? chop chop chop?,S02E28,239
Even I can't make that work.,S02E28,240
You know what doesn't work? This.,S02E28,241
You know what you are jealous.,S02E28,242
"Yes, I am,",S02E28,243
Of people that don't have to work with you.,S02E28,244
Then fine.,S02E28,245
Don't work with me.,S02E28,246
I'll write trashy by myself.,S02E28,247
"Okay, well, I'll write tim can by myself,",S02E28,248
"Then next week at story time, we'll let the kids decide which one's best.",S02E28,249
Oh yeah yeah. They'll decide To feed your book to trashy!,S02E28,250
"When mommy finishes reading her book at story time,",S02E28,251
"I want you to jump up and yell, yay, trashy!",S02E28,252
"- Can you do that for me? - Yay, trashy!",S02E28,253
Yay!,S02E28,254
- What are you doing? - Nothing.,S02E28,255
You're coaching Charlie.,S02E28,256
"Mom, that's cheating.",S02E28,257
I am her mother.,S02E28,258
It is my job to tell her what stuff to like.,S02E28,259
"Okay, so trashy's the right stuff?",S02E28,260
Enh-enh-enh.,S02E28,261
"Even though you're mocking me,",S02E28,262
It still works.,S02E28,263
"Okay, Charlie, now repeat after me,",S02E28,264
"Tim can, I love Tim can.",S02E28,265
"Yay, trashy!",S02E28,266
Gahhh!,S02E28,267
"Guys, what are you doing here?",S02E28,268
- This is my mother Elaine.,S02E28,269
- We need you.,S02E28,270
"We tried ordering chicken,",S02E28,271
But they said you weren't working today.,S02E28,272
"Well, I guess I could fit you in.",S02E28,273
Have a seat.,S02E28,274
"Okay, talk to me.",S02E28,275
I didn't come halfway across this country.,S02E28,276
So these two could go out on a date night.,S02E28,277
Then feel free to go back.,S02E28,278
"Scott, that is my mother.",S02E28,279
"Okay okay, I see what's going on here.",S02E28,280
"You guys are talking at each other, not with each other.",S02E28,281
"Now you talk to me, and I'll talk to him.",S02E28,282
And he'll talk to me and I'll talk to her.,S02E28,283
"She'll talk to me, and I'll talk to you.",S02E28,284
"That's you to me, me to him, him to me,",S02E28,285
"Me to her, her to me, me to you.",S02E28,286
It's just that simple.,S02E28,287
It's kind of hard to take you seriously without the hat.,S02E28,288
"Oh, sorry.",S02E28,289
Let's get to work.,S02E28,290
I was just afraid of losing you.,S02E28,291
You'll never lose me.,S02E28,292
"And you can stay here as long as you like, {\i1}mom.{\i0}",S02E28,293
What's going on in here?,S02E28,294
Healing.,S02E28,295
What's going on in here is healing.,S02E28,296
"Thank you, Mr.",S02E28,297
Turtlebaum.,S02E28,298
Oh.,S02E28,299
Of turtlebaum & turtlebaum accounting:,S02E28,300
A professional corporation.,S02E28,301
Right.,S02E28,302
Now let's give a warm room six welcome.,S02E28,303
"To my dad, Bob Duncan.",S02E28,304
- Hey.,S02E28,305
- Dazzle me.,S02E28,306
"Hey, everybody, I am Bob Duncan of Bob's bugs be gone.",S02E28,307
And I am here today.,S02E28,308
To talk to you.,S02E28,309
About the fine art of pest control.,S02E28,310
"Yes. Now in my typical day,",S02E28,311
I come across all sorts of insects,S02E28,312
"Ants, roaches, mice.",S02E28,313
"wait, Mr. Duncan, you say,",S02E28,314
mice aren't insects. They are,S02E28,315
Anybody?,S02E28,316
That's right.,S02E28,317
They are rodents.,S02E28,318
Not here to learn.,S02E28,319
"Anyway, I've brought along some animals.",S02E28,320
"That, although I've never seen them on the job,",S02E28,321
I could quite possibly catch.,S02E28,322
If we were living in a different climate.,S02E28,323
On a different continent.,S02E28,324
For example,S02E28,325
{\i1}Look at that guy{\i0},S02E28,326
That is an emperor scorpion.,S02E28,327
"Now some people say that its sting is no worse than a bee's,",S02E28,328
"And others, well, they're not around to say anything.",S02E28,329
Ow!,S02E28,330
I'm just kidding.,S02E28,331
I'm just kidding.,S02E28,332
"Hey, you thought that was cool, huh?",S02E28,333
Wait until you check out this guy.,S02E28,334
Whoa.,S02E28,335
"Look at him, huh?",S02E28,336
This is a corn snake.,S02E28,337
"Pretty cool, huh? That's my dad.",S02E28,338
"Hello, everybody, welcome to story time.",S02E28,339
"My name is Teddy, and today we have a special treat.",S02E28,340
You're gonna hear two stories.,S02E28,341
"The first one is written by me, and it's called.",S02E28,342
Tim can and his amazing journey.,S02E28,343
Tin can?,S02E28,344
Tim.,S02E28,345
{\i0} Tim can.,S02E28,346
"All right, now before we begin,",S02E28,347
"Just a reminder, as of today,",S02E28,348
This story has not been published.,S02E28,349
Okay.,S02E28,350
"Once upon a time, there was a little can of soup.",S02E28,351
And his name was Tim.,S02E28,352
Tim lived at the grocery store hoping someday someone would buy him.,S02E28,353
One day a nice woman did.,S02E28,354
Her name was Candace.,S02E28,355
Oh! Hey! That's your name.,S02E28,356
-That's funny.,S02E28,357
-Okay.,S02E28,358
"Candace took Tim home,",S02E28,359
"Poured his soup in a pot,",S02E28,360
Then tossed him in the recycling bin.,S02E28,361
Tim was sad.,S02E28,362
Is that all there is?  he wondered.,S02E28,363
That's what I'm wondering.,S02E28,364
"Poor plumber, having to follow me.",S02E28,365
"I guess somebody had to go on after Elvis, right?",S02E28,366
"You did great, dad, and more importantly,",S02E28,367
- So did your belt.,S02E28,368
- Yeah.,S02E28,369
"Gabe, your old man wasn't gonna let you down.",S02E28,370
Have you seen the scorpion?,S02E28,371
- What? You lost a scorp - Wait wait wait wait.,S02E28,372
Let's just find it quietly by ourselves.,S02E28,373
"All right. Scorpions aren't poisonous, right?",S02E28,374
How should I know? I just rented it this morning.,S02E28,375
I thought I saw something on tv that said a scorpion can paralyze you.,S02E28,376
That might have been a nice thing to mention.,S02E28,377
Before I let it walk on me.,S02E28,378
I think they found it.,S02E28,379
and after Tim had been recycled into Tim pie plate.,S02E28,380
"And Tim aluminum foil,",S02E28,381
He went back to being Tim can.,S02E28,382
And lived happily ever after.,S02E28,383
The end.,S02E28,384
Yay!,S02E28,385
"Well, kids, wasn't that better than cheesy and pepe pizza?",S02E28,386
Yeah!,S02E28,387
"Hey, kids, here comes trashy!{\i0}",S02E28,388
"Hey, everybody,",S02E28,389
I'm trashy the trash can.,S02E28,390
But I'm not just any trash can.,S02E28,391
"No, I'm a trash can that gives out candy.",S02E28,392
Whoo!,S02E28,393
And the best part about trashy.,S02E28,394
Is that he has magical powers.,S02E28,395
So that he never runs out of candy.,S02E28,396
"Yeah, eat it up.",S02E28,397
"Yeah, eat it up.",S02E28,398
And that's the story of trashy the trash can.,S02E28,399
The end.,S02E28,400
That's not a story.,S02E28,401
You're just throwing candy at the kids so they'll like your book better.,S02E28,402
"Well, let's see if it works. Who likes trashy better than Tim can?",S02E28,403
- Me! - Ooh ooh ooh! Yeah yeah!,S02E28,404
"Mm-hmm. - Oh, yeah?",S02E28,405
"Well, I forgot to tell you one thing about Tim can.",S02E28,406
He is gonna take all of you kids in the library.,S02E28,407
Out for ice cream.,S02E28,408
"Okay, everybody repeat after me.",S02E28,409
Trashy! Trashy! Trashy!,S02E28,410
- Tim can! Tim can! Tim can! - Trashy! Trashy! Trashy!,S02E28,411
"Oh, Candace, do you wanna buy my story?",S02E28,412
Or do you wanna buy story?,S02E28,413
What I want is to find a new library for story time.,S02E28,414
Great. What am I supposed to do with 500 of these?,S02E28,415
And what seems to be the problem tonight?,S02E28,416
There's no problem.,S02E28,417
Everything's great.,S02E28,418
Aren't we past this? Let's dive in.,S02E28,419
"No, seriously, we're fine.",S02E28,420
We worked out all our issues.,S02E28,421
Then why'd you order chicken?,S02E28,422
Because we're hungry.,S02E28,423
"But if you guys are fine,",S02E28,424
Then I'm just the chicken guy.,S02E28,425
Pretty much.,S02E28,426
Thanks.,S02E28,427
Keep the change.,S02E28,428
I'll be back!,S02E28,429
I forgot your sides.,S02E28,430
Gabe.,S02E28,431
Can I talk to you for a minute?,S02E28,432
Kinda busy with my string cheese.,S02E28,433
"Buddy, I'm really sorry about today.",S02E28,434
All you asked me to do was not embarrass you.,S02E28,435
And that's exactly what I did.,S02E28,436
"Dad, you didn't embarrass me.",S02E28,437
"Thanks to you, everybody loves me.",S02E28,438
What?,S02E28,439
"Yeah, after the scorpion stung you, and then you passed out,",S02E28,440
And then Mr.,S02E28,441
Turtlebaum tried to suck the poison out of you.,S02E28,442
And then he passed out.,S02E28,443
What?,S02E28,444
"In all the confusion, the snake got loose.",S02E28,445
"Yeah, backup. Turtlebaum did what?",S02E28,446
"And then while you were at the hospital,",S02E28,447
The fire department came and the whole school was evacuated for the day.,S02E28,448
I am a hero because of you.,S02E28,449
"Thanks, dad.",S02E28,450
Now I'm gonna need an answer on that turtlebaum question.,S02E28,451
"Well, Charlie, needless to say,",S02E28,452
"I'm still unpublished,",S02E28,453
But the good news is so is mom.,S02E28,454
I think we learned a very important lesson.,S02E28,455
I look good even in a trash can.,S02E28,456
"Well, that's one of the lessons.",S02E28,457
"- So - I just feel so empty,",S02E28,458
So abandoned.,S02E28,459
I guess it'd be safe to say I feel used.,S02E28,460
You know what I'm saying?,S02E28,461
"PJ, the poor kid been here for 10 minutes.",S02E28,462
Pay him already.{\i0},S02E28,463
"Hey, see you tomorrow?",S02E28,464
"Sometimes there's nothing left to say but good luck, Charlie.",S02E28,465
Poor me.,S02E28,466
"I don't have any toppings,",S02E28,467
Just cheese.,S02E28,468
"You're a loser, cheesy.",S02E28,469
"Look at me, all covered in pepperoni.",S02E28,470
There must be something good about being so plain.,S02E28,471
"Oh yeah, when you think of it, let me know.",S02E28,472
Uh-oh.,S02E28,473
Plain old cheese or delicious pepperoni?,S02E28,474
No!,S02E28,475
"Huh, I guess there is something good.",S02E28,476
About being plain.,S02E28,477
It'd be a shame to leave just one.,S02E28,478
I was afraid of that.,S02E28,479
"Great news, everybody!",S02E29,0
"This year for once, I don't have to work on Thanksgiving.",S02E29,1
So we can all be together!,S02E29,2
And I can cook Thanksgiving dinner.,S02E29,3
- All right.,S02E29,4
- Yay.,S02E29,5
"Okay, what happened there?",S02E29,6
"Honey, come on, it's just that cooking",S02E29,7
Thanksgiving dinner is a lot of work.,S02E29,8
"Yeah, are you sure we shouldn't just eat out?",S02E29,9
"I mean, for your sake.",S02E29,10
No way.,S02E29,11
Every Thanksgiving I have to eat Turkey sandwiches.,S02E29,12
Out of the hospital vending machine.,S02E29,13
And you guys have to go to the old time buffet.,S02E29,14
"This year we're gonna be together,",S02E29,15
And I am gonna cook.,S02E29,16
Old time buffet offers quality and value.,S02E29,17
"Yeah, and their chicken fingers, mwah!",S02E29,18
Right?,S02E29,19
We are having dinner here and that is final.,S02E29,20
"All right, okay.",S02E29,21
"Actually, you know, I have a Thanksgiving announcement.",S02E29,22
This year we are going to be joined by grandpa.,S02E29,23
Grandpa Duncan.,S02E29,24
Yeah.,S02E29,25
"Hurts, doesn't it?",S02E29,26
"Oh, come on, you guys.",S02E29,27
- My dad has some good qualities. - Such as?,S02E29,28
"You know what? He exhales carbon dioxide, which is needed by plants.",S02E29,29
"All right, well, we've got bigger problems.",S02E29,30
Mom's cooking Thanksgiving dinner.,S02E29,31
"Oh, no no no no no.",S02E29,32
The best chef in the house,S02E29,33
P.,S02E29,34
J.,S02E29,35
Is cooking Thanksgiving dinner.,S02E29,36
I am? She's never gonna let me.,S02E29,37
That's why you have to trick her.,S02E29,38
"Give her the illusion that she's cooking, when in reality,",S02E29,39
You're the one doing all the work.,S02E29,40
"Got it, got it.",S02E29,41
Just one question.,S02E29,42
What does illusion mean?,S02E29,43
Three words,S02E29,44
Cook Thanksgiving dinner.,S02E29,45
Right now?,S02E29,46
"Relax, dad.",S02E29,47
Just messing with you.,S02E29,48
"Oh, by the way, thanksgiving two words.",S02E29,49
Today's all burnt toast ,S02E29,50
"Running late, and dad jokes",S02E29,51
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S02E29,52
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S02E29,53
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S02E29,54
There it is up on the roof,S02E29,55
"I've been there, I've survived",S02E29,56
So just take my advice,S02E29,57
"Hang in there, baby",S02E29,58
Things are crazy,S02E29,59
But I know your future's bright,S02E29,60
"Hang in there, baby",S02E29,61
There's no maybe,S02E29,62
Everything turns out all right,S02E29,63
Your life is up and down,S02E29,64
But trust me it comes back around,S02E29,65
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S02E29,66
"Hang in there, baby.",S02E29,67
"What you drawing there, Charlie?",S02E29,68
A Turkey.,S02E29,69
- Are you sure? - Yeah.,S02E29,70
It looks a bit more like mashed potatoes.,S02E29,71
"Look, big Thanksgiving sale at the gizmo hut.",S02E29,72
They're selling mytabs for $49? That's awesome!,S02E29,73
I know! But we have to get in line early.,S02E29,74
Because they'll only have 10 of these at that price.,S02E29,75
So we have to wait in line on Thanksgiving day?,S02E29,76
"Yes, the sale starts at midnight.",S02E29,77
Why did they have to make it so hard?,S02E29,78
All we wanna do is celebrate.,S02E29,79
The true meaning of Thanksgiving,S02E29,80
Buying electronics at terrific prices.,S02E29,81
I'm saying.,S02E29,82
Turkey.,S02E29,83
Why do you always answer the door when I come over?,S02E29,84
How about you stop coming over and I'll stop answering the door?,S02E29,85
"Hi, Mrs.",S02E29,86
Dabney.,S02E29,87
"Amy, I have a question for you.",S02E29,88
Do you know where I can get a small Turkey for one?,S02E29,89
It's just me this year.,S02E29,90
"Oh, well, where's Mr. Dabney?",S02E29,91
Didn't you hear? I divorced his sorry butt.,S02E29,92
"Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.",S02E29,93
I'm not.,S02E29,94
We were just making each other miserable.,S02E29,95
Now I can be the happy-go-lucky person I always was.,S02E29,96
You are?,S02E29,97
"I mean I mean, you can.",S02E29,98
You are?,S02E29,99
"So anyway, I'll be eating.",S02E29,100
"That tiny Turkey in that big empty house,",S02E29,101
"All alone, by myself,",S02E29,102
Just me.,S02E29,103
"Well, it'll be good practice for Christmas.",S02E29,104
After you.,S02E29,105
"Mrs. Dabney, would you like to",S02E29,106
Mrs.,S02E29,107
"Dabney, would you like to join us.",S02E29,108
For Thanksgiving dinner?,S02E29,109
"Well, this is coming out of nowhere.",S02E29,110
I'll have to check my schedule.,S02E29,111
Bye now.,S02E29,112
Why did you do that?,S02E29,113
I was being gracious.,S02E29,114
And I was being neighborly.,S02E29,115
"All right, well, that better end by Christmas.",S02E29,116
"Hey, mom, what you got there?",S02E29,117
It's the menu for Thanksgiving.,S02E29,118
Talk about great timing.,S02E29,119
Because I was gonna volunteer to help you cook.,S02E29,120
P.,S02E29,121
J.,S02E29,122
", that is so sweet, but actually I was gonna ask Teddy.",S02E29,123
"Mom, Teddy does not have time.",S02E29,124
She is off in her own little world.,S02E29,125
With the dolls and the horses.,S02E29,126
And the dress-up.,S02E29,127
"You do know she's not seven, right?",S02E29,128
Whatever.,S02E29,129
Let me see the list.,S02E29,130
"Okay, I'm just gonna put a little check.",S02E29,131
Next to the things I like to cook.,S02E29,132
"Yeah, yes.",S02E29,133
"Ooh, definitely.",S02E29,134
"Oh oh oh oh, yeah.",S02E29,135
"Honey, you checked everything but the rolls.",S02E29,136
"Oh, right, sorry.",S02E29,137
rolls.,S02E29,138
"Okay, fine, you can cook all that other stuff,",S02E29,139
But I am definitely cooking the Turkey.,S02E29,140
"Wait, that wasn't on the list.",S02E29,141
"Well, I thought it was obvious.",S02E29,142
"I got bogged down on the side dishes, lost my focus.",S02E29,143
So how did it go?,S02E29,144
I've got some bad news.,S02E29,145
What?,S02E29,146
She's making one dish.,S02E29,147
Please say broccoli.,S02E29,148
Please say broccoli.,S02E29,149
It rhymes with schmurkey.,S02E29,150
It's Turkey.,S02E29,151
"- Hey, everybody, grandpa's here. - Hey!",S02E29,152
"Yeah yeah, my, how you've grown.",S02E29,153
Blah blah blah.,S02E29,154
I don't believe you've met Charlie.,S02E29,155
Now why is he dressed like a girl?,S02E29,156
"Well, because she is a girl.",S02E29,157
"Yes, Charlie is short for Charlotte.",S02E29,158
Then why isn't she called {\i1}Sharlie?{\i0},S02E29,159
"Seriously, I don't get it.",S02E29,160
"You give the girls boys' names. He should be Teddy,",S02E29,161
"He should be Charlie, and she should be P.",S02E29,162
J.,S02E29,163
"We're not renaming the kids, dad.",S02E29,164
"Good news. I checked my schedule,",S02E29,165
And it turns out I am available on Thanksgiving.,S02E29,166
"All right, really? Who left the door open?",S02E29,167
Mrs.,S02E29,168
"Dabney, this is my father-in-law Frank Duncan.",S02E29,169
"Frank, Estelle Dabney.",S02E29,170
"Bob, I was wondering if you could come over.",S02E29,171
And look at my garbage disposal.,S02E29,172
- It's not working right.,S02E29,173
"- Oh, I'll do it.",S02E29,174
Had my own plumbing business for 30 years.,S02E29,175
"Plumbing, now that's a man's job.",S02E29,176
"You want someone to catch a butterfly,",S02E29,177
Call my son.,S02E29,178
Let's go.,S02E29,179
"Yes, we're numbers nine and 10!",S02E29,180
- You're nine and I'm 10? - Yeah.,S02E29,181
Why don't I get to be nine?,S02E29,182
What difference does it make? We're both getting mytabs.,S02E29,183
Then I'm nine.,S02E29,184
"Oh, great, I gotta spend the rest of the day in line.",S02E29,185
Behind you two losers.,S02E29,186
"Well well well,",S02E29,187
"If it isn't Karl, the neighborhood jerk.",S02E29,188
"If you were planning on getting a mytab,",S02E29,189
You're out of luck.,S02E29,190
You're number 11.,S02E29,191
Not if I outrun you.,S02E29,192
"And when I get my mytab, I'm gonna go online to the losers site.",S02E29,193
And post something on your loser page.,S02E29,194
"That says, hey, loser!",S02E29,195
This is gonna be a long day.,S02E29,196
"Excuse me, Karl.",S02E29,197
I'm gonna zip up the invisible wall now.,S02E29,198
So we don't have to listen to you.,S02E29,199
You can still hear me.,S02E29,200
I know you can.,S02E29,201
"Hey, invisible walls stupid.",S02E29,202
"I'm sorry, what?",S02E29,203
"T, you should get going so you can make it home for your Thanksgiving dinner.",S02E29,204
"Yeah, you're right.",S02E29,205
"Well, I'll be back at 4:00 so you can go to your dinner.",S02E29,206
- See ya.,S02E29,207
- See ya.,S02E29,208
"Hey, Ivy,",S02E29,209
"Now that Teddy's gone,",S02E29,210
I can finally admit that I'm not really a jerk.,S02E29,211
I'm just a vulnerable kid who's too scared to admit.,S02E29,212
That he needs a friend.,S02E29,213
"Oh, really?",S02E29,214
"No, I'm a jerk. Loser!",S02E29,215
"Yep, a real long day.",S02E29,216
"Oh, man, this is just weird.",S02E29,217
- What is? - Grandpa.,S02E29,218
He seems happy.,S02E29,219
It's very unsettling.,S02E29,220
"Peek-a-boo, I see you.",S02E29,221
Peek-a-boo.,S02E29,222
"All right, you know what? We'd better go make sure he's okay.",S02E29,223
Here we go. I'm gonna get ya!,S02E29,224
Here he comes. Whooo!,S02E29,225
"Oh, she's a cutie pie!",S02E29,226
"And you were cute, too, when you were at that age, Gabe.",S02E29,227
Boop.,S02E29,228
"Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!",S02E29,229
Happy Thanksgiving.,S02E29,230
"She's acting weird, too?",S02E29,231
"Okay, something's not right.",S02E29,232
This is such a wonderful day.,S02E29,233
I have so much to be thankful for.,S02E29,234
Like what?,S02E29,235
"Well, I am thankful.",S02E29,236
That I have a new man in my life.,S02E29,237
And I am thankful to be that man.,S02E29,238
Um So you two are together now?,S02E29,239
That's right.,S02E29,240
After Frank unclogged my disposal,S02E29,241
He unclogged my heart.,S02E29,242
So it looks like I'll be sticking around.,S02E29,243
For a while.,S02E29,244
"And who knows, Gabe? Someday soon,",S02E29,245
You might be calling me grandma.,S02E29,246
"Gabe, let's go for a catch.",S02E29,247
- A what? - Just go outside.,S02E29,248
"All right, what are we gonna do?",S02E29,249
There's only one thing we can do.,S02E29,250
We gotta split em up.,S02E29,251
"Oh, that sounds evil.",S02E29,252
I like it.,S02E29,253
"Hey, you know what?",S02E29,254
All we have to do is just help them to get to know each other.,S02E29,255
"I mean, once we do that",S02E29,256
Then they'll hate each other.,S02E29,257
- Exactly. - Yeah!,S02E29,258
Wait wait wait. Should we do this?,S02E29,259
They are older people.,S02E29,260
This may be their last chance at happiness.,S02E29,261
You mean your new mom's last chance at happiness?,S02E29,262
"Yeah, they're going down.",S02E29,263
"- What happened? - Honey, I shrunk the Turkey.",S02E29,264
"Oh no, you must have flash roasted it.",S02E29,265
Flash roasted? What's that?,S02E29,266
"Well, it's complicated.",S02E29,267
It's what happens when you simultaneously.,S02E29,268
Over-breast and under-roast.,S02E29,269
"Put simply, it shrinks everything.",S02E29,270
- Even the bones? - Especially the bones.,S02E29,271
P.,S02E29,272
J.,S02E29,273
", what are we gonna do?.",S02E29,274
"Well, I'm just thinking on my feet here,",S02E29,275
"- But we do have a deep fryer. - Yeah, so?",S02E29,276
"So if we deep fry a Turkey, dinner could be ready in 90 minutes.",S02E29,277
Where are we gonna get another bird on Thanksgiving?,S02E29,278
I have a spare Turkey in the garage.,S02E29,279
Why do you have a spare Turkey in the garage?,S02E29,280
Why don't you have a spare Turkey in the garage?,S02E29,281
- Go get it.,S02E29,282
- Okay.,S02E29,283
"Hey, mom, are we gonna eat soon?",S02E29,284
'cause everyone's really hungry.,S02E29,285
And would love to be done by 4:00.,S02E29,286
"Actually, dinner has been delayed.",S02E29,287
P.,S02E29,288
J.,S02E29,289
Flash roasted the Turkey.,S02E29,290
And now we have to start all over.,S02E29,291
"Ivy, hi, it's me.",S02E29,292
"Listen, my mom ruined the Turkey.",S02E29,293
"And blamed it on my brother,",S02E29,294
So I'm gonna be late.,S02E29,295
"Yeah, no, okay.",S02E29,296
"Don't worry, though.",S02E29,297
I'll think of something.,S02E29,298
Just you stay in line.,S02E29,299
I'll be there as soon as I can.,S02E29,300
Okay.,S02E29,301
"Mom, oh mom,",S02E29,302
I have a headache.,S02E29,303
Wow.,S02E29,304
So maybe I should rest in my room for a bit.,S02E29,305
"So if you don't see me for, like, two hours or so just remember,",S02E29,306
I'm in my room.,S02E29,307
"Well, honey, you're probably hungry.",S02E29,308
"Here, nibble on the flash Turkey.",S02E29,309
"Yeah, I'll be in my room.",S02E29,310
"If I boil you, will you plump back up?",S02E29,311
Who are you talking to?,S02E29,312
The mini Turkey.,S02E29,313
"Estelle, you make me feel like a new man.",S02E29,314
- Woof! - Meow.,S02E29,315
"Hey, you know what? I got a really fun game.",S02E29,316
Called let's not make animal sounds.,S02E29,317
"So, Mrs. Dabney",S02E29,318
"Oh, Gabe, baby, why so formal?",S02E29,319
Call me Nana.,S02E29,320
Or better yet gam-gam.,S02E29,321
"So, ha ha ha, gam-gam",S02E29,322
"It's interesting that you meowed,",S02E29,323
Because we know how much you love your Cat caboodle.,S02E29,324
"And dad doesn't like cats at all. Isn't that right, dad?",S02E29,325
- Hate em.,S02E29,326
- Then caboodle's gone.,S02E29,327
But you love that Cat more than anything.,S02E29,328
- I thought I did.,S02E29,329
- Oh.,S02E29,330
"Hey, did you know my dad snores so loud,",S02E29,331
He rattles the whole house?,S02E29,332
"Good, Mr.",S02E29,333
Dabney was one of those silent sleepers.,S02E29,334
"At least with a snorer,",S02E29,335
You know there's a man in the house.,S02E29,336
And I hope he's there for a long time.,S02E29,337
Me too.,S02E29,338
- Woof.,S02E29,339
- Meow.,S02E29,340
"Hey, how we doing out here? Everyone's really hungry.",S02E29,341
Dinner should be ready in 90 minutes.,S02E29,342
You think you could speed it up?,S02E29,343
Grandpa Frank keeps tracing finger hearts on Mrs.,S02E29,344
Dabney's back.,S02E29,345
I guess I could whip up some little sandwiches.,S02E29,346
"- Watch the bird, okay? - Yeah, sure.",S02E29,347
I'm gonna watch it cook twice as fast.,S02E29,348
"Charlie, are you gonna eat your sandwich?",S02E29,349
"- Yes. - Well, can I have just a bite?",S02E29,350
"No, daddy.",S02E29,351
I'll buy you a doll.,S02E29,352
"Okay, everyone,",S02E29,353
Dinner will be ready in 10 minutes.,S02E29,354
"No, it won't.",S02E29,355
The Turkey's gotta cook for another hour.,S02E29,356
That's where you're wrong.,S02E29,357
I turned up the heat.,S02E29,358
"- You did what? - Turned up the heat, cut the cooking time in half.",S02E29,359
"You can't do that. If the oil gets too hot, then the Turkey might",S02E29,360
Explode.,S02E29,361
"Oh, look at that Turkey go!",S02E29,362
"Oh no, it's coming back down.",S02E29,363
- Whoa whoa whoa! - No no no!,S02E29,364
"Okay, Ivy, I'm on my way.",S02E29,365
"Yeah, see ya.",S02E29,366
"How you feeling, sweetie?",S02E29,367
What happened to me again?,S02E29,368
Turkey fell out of the sky on you.,S02E29,369
But turkeys can't fly. Can they?,S02E29,370
"No, I guess in cartoons they can.",S02E29,371
"Oh, I like cartoons.",S02E29,372
"Okay, everybody.",S02E29,373
Fresh from the vending machine.,S02E29,374
- Happy Thanksgiving.,S02E29,375
"- Well, at least they're Turkey.",S02E29,376
Or may contain Turkey.,S02E29,377
"Hey, honey, I'm sorry.",S02E29,378
You gotta eat Turkey sandwiches in the hospital again.,S02E29,379
I know this isn't the Thanksgiving you wanted.,S02E29,380
"Well, it's not.",S02E29,381
But you know what? We're all together.,S02E29,382
Teddy's okay.{\i0},S02E29,383
And that is what I'm thankful for.,S02E29,384
"Yeah. Hey, you know what?",S02E29,385
I am thankful for everybody in this room.,S02E29,386
- Me too.,S02E29,387
- Me too.,S02E29,388
I'm thankful that the patient in room 212 ordered ice cream.,S02E29,389
I wonder how the lovebirds are doing.{\i0},S02E29,390
You can't talk to me that way.{\i0},S02E29,391
"I can talk to you any way I want, dimwit.{\i0}",S02E29,392
That sounds promising.,S02E29,393
"Hey, what's going on?",S02E29,394
He's an idiot.,S02E29,395
She's a battleaxe.,S02E29,396
"Yeah, we knew that, but what happened?",S02E29,397
We spent an hour alone together.,S02E29,398
Longest hour of my life.,S02E29,399
So you two aren't a couple anymore?,S02E29,400
"No, we are not.",S02E29,401
"And to think, I was gonna move to Arizona with you.",S02E29,402
Say what now?,S02E29,403
Wait wait.,S02E29,404
There's still time.,S02E29,405
You guys can work this out.,S02E29,406
"I mean, you're perfect for each other.",S02E29,407
"- Oh! - Wait wait, come back!",S02E29,408
Gam-gam!,S02E29,409
"Well, Charlie, another Duncan family Thanksgiving.",S02E29,410
Has come and gone.,S02E29,411
The good news is grandpa Duncan.,S02E29,412
Has also come and gone.,S02E29,413
"Hey, Teddy, tell me what you think about this.",S02E29,414
"Dear Mrs. Dabney,",S02E29,415
I'm sorry for our ugly words.,S02E29,416
Please forgive me.,S02E29,417
Sell your house and move to Phoenix immediately.,S02E29,418
Do not call first.,S02E29,419
Just surprise me.,S02E29,420
"Forever yours, grandpa.",S02E29,421
I think you'd sign it Frank.,S02E29,422
"Oh, yeah, that's good.",S02E29,423
I could use that.,S02E29,424
"Anyway, since we never got a Thanksgiving dinner,",S02E29,425
P.,S02E29,426
J.,S02E29,427
Is about to deep fry another Turkey.,S02E29,428
So just to be on the safe side.,S02E29,429
"Wish me good luck, Charlie.",S02E29,430
That was the worst shopping experience.,S02E29,431
- Of my life.,S02E29,432
- Mine too.,S02E29,433
"I mean, I heard those sales were brutal,",S02E29,434
But I didn't know they were this bad.,S02E29,435
And we were so close to getting that last mytab.,S02E29,436
Then that monster came in.,S02E29,437
And started throwing us around like ragdolls.,S02E29,438
What just happened in there?,S02E29,439
"Karl, are you crying?",S02E29,440
Somebody stepped on my neck.,S02E29,441
C'mon.,S02E29,442
And is it really worth treating people like this to get a stupid mytab?,S02E29,443
Yes.,S02E29,444
Okay.,S02E30,0
"Hey, dad, can I go away with Ivy and her family this weekend?",S02E30,1
Ivy says they have a nice house on the Lake.,S02E30,2
A weekend getaway?,S02E30,3
House on the Lake? Crackling fire?,S02E30,4
Can you bring a friend?,S02E30,5
Or a dad?,S02E30,6
Kind of it's not a getaway unless I get away from,S02E30,7
Me?,S02E30,8
Thanks for understanding.,S02E30,9
- Have fun. - Love you!,S02E30,10
"Hey, dad.",S02E30,11
"- Hey, dad. - How are you doing?",S02E30,12
Anything you boys care to tell me?,S02E30,13
What makes you think we want to tell you something?,S02E30,14
That.,S02E30,15
"Well well well, Mrs.",S02E30,16
Dabney.,S02E30,17
With a baseball and a satellite dish.,S02E30,18
- What do I owe you? - Don't worry about it.,S02E30,19
I still have your credit card number on file.,S02E30,20
Today's all burnt toast ,S02E30,21
"Running late, and dad jokes",S02E30,22
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S02E30,23
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S02E30,24
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S02E30,25
There it is up on the roof,S02E30,26
"I've been there, I've survived",S02E30,27
So just take my advice,S02E30,28
"Hang in there, baby",S02E30,29
Things are crazy,S02E30,30
But I know your future's bright,S02E30,31
"Hang in there, baby",S02E30,32
There's no maybe,S02E30,33
Everything turns out all right,S02E30,34
Your life is up and down,S02E30,35
But trust me it comes back around,S02E30,36
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S02E30,37
"Hang in there, baby.",S02E30,38
"Hey, Charlie.",S02E30,39
- Whatcha doing? - Timeout.,S02E30,40
- What happened? - I was bad.,S02E30,41
Could I talk to you in here for a minute?,S02E30,42
That's a timeout chair?,S02E30,43
This whole time I thought it was just Gabe's chair.,S02E30,44
What's going on?,S02E30,45
"Bob, I am so upset.",S02E30,46
Charlie said a bad word at school today.,S02E30,47
What? What did she say?,S02E30,48
Whoa.,S02E30,49
Our little girl said that?,S02E30,50
"Well, apparently she was making.",S02E30,51
"A macaroni necklace when some kid pushed her,",S02E30,52
Knocked her macaroni and out came the word.,S02E30,53
"Well, at least she used it correctly.",S02E30,54
Actually her teacher said she's swearing at a second-grade level.,S02E30,55
I just can't picture our little angel saying something like that.,S02E30,56
Me neither.,S02E30,57
"No, I'm sorry. You know what?",S02E30,58
"Until I hear that myself, I don't believe it.",S02E30,59
You're right.,S02E30,60
I mean Charlie is the perfect combination of all of our kids.,S02E30,61
"She's got the intelligence of Teddy,",S02E30,62
The sweetness of P.,S02E30,63
J.,S02E30,64
And none of Gabe.,S02E30,65
"To the mountains we will go, the mountains we will go",S02E30,66
To our cabin in the mountains,S02E30,67
The Wentzes and Teddy will go.,S02E30,68
"How was that one, Teddy?",S02E30,69
"Oh, best one yet.",S02E30,70
Are they gonna do this the whole way?,S02E30,71
"If you just said, do they do this the whole way?",S02E30,72
The answer is yes.,S02E30,73
"So, Teddy, what do you think about the new car?",S02E30,74
"- Oh, it's it's nice.",S02E30,75
Bought this one right after you wrecked.,S02E30,76
My old car Gracie in less than 20 minutes.,S02E30,77
- Remember that? - Sure do.,S02E30,78
"I had such a bad feeling when I saw you drive her away that day,",S02E30,79
But I didn't say anything.,S02E30,80
I'll never forgive myself for that.,S02E30,81
To the mountains we will go,S02E30,82
The mountains we will go,S02E30,83
To the,S02E30,84
"Okay, Charlie,",S02E30,85
"Mommy and daddy want to talk to you today about words,",S02E30,86
- Especially new words.,S02E30,87
- Okay.,S02E30,88
So let's say somebody.,S02E30,89
Knocked over your juice.,S02E30,90
Now what would you say to that?,S02E30,91
Oopsy.,S02E30,92
But if you really didn't like it?,S02E30,93
Uh-oh.,S02E30,94
"Okay okay, let's",S02E30,95
Let's say somebody took your juice.,S02E30,96
Huh? What would you say then?,S02E30,97
Or if somebody took your juice.,S02E30,98
And then did this all over you?,S02E30,99
Are we trying to get her to say the word or me to say the word?,S02E30,100
"-Bob, this is silly. -I know!",S02E30,101
She's not saying it now because she never said it in the first place.,S02E30,102
"Exactly, she never said it.",S02E30,103
"Come on, sweetie.",S02E30,104
Let's go get daddy a new shirt.,S02E30,105
- She said it. - She said it?,S02E30,106
She dropped her doll and she said it.,S02E30,107
"Oh, Charlie, you didn't.",S02E30,108
"I did, daddy.",S02E30,109
Won't you come in?,S02E30,110
"Hey hey, we were watching that.",S02E30,111
Too bad.,S02E30,112
My story is on.,S02E30,113
"And since you broke my dish, I'll be watching my show here.",S02E30,114
"If you want some of my popcorn, ask for it.",S02E30,115
- Can I have some of your popcorn? - No.,S02E30,116
So what is this show?,S02E30,117
It's called The Tears of Tomorrow.,S02E30,118
"It's about the tears family of tomorrow, Maine.",S02E30,119
"In the last episode, Chance Tears found out.",S02E30,120
His seventh wife Amanda is actually a Clone.,S02E30,121
Quiet.,S02E30,122
It's starting.,S02E30,123
From the heartaches of today come The Tears of Tomorrow.,S02E30,124
"Yeah, let's go, P.",S02E30,125
J.,S02E30,126
"- Whoa, uh, who who's that? - That's Tiffany Tears.",S02E30,127
All she ever wears is a tiny bikini.,S02E30,128
It's disgusting.,S02E30,129
Sure is.,S02E30,130
"Ooh, and that's Brick Tears.",S02E30,131
He's chance's 12-year-old grandson.,S02E30,132
He's a boy genius with a taste for evil.,S02E30,133
Move over!,S02E30,134
"Amanda, who is this?",S02E30,135
"I'm glad you asked, chance.",S02E30,136
This is my new boyfriend Chauncey.,S02E30,137
What? But he looks just like me.,S02E30,138
That's right.,S02E30,139
You're not the only one who knows how to Clone.,S02E30,140
"Man, I did not see that coming.",S02E30,141
"Oh, there's Brick. What's he got in his hand?",S02E30,142
"Brick, what do you have in your hand?",S02E30,143
"Brick, put that weapon down! No!",S02E30,144
Oh!,S02E30,145
These have been The Tears of Tomorrow.,S02E30,146
Wait. That's it?,S02E30,147
- But what about brick? - And what about Tiffany?,S02E30,148
She went to change bathing suits and never came back.,S02E30,149
Calm down.,S02E30,150
The show's on again tomorrow.,S02E30,151
Tomorrow?,S02E30,152
I did not see that coming!,S02E30,153
"All right, everybody, we're here.",S02E30,154
Where's the house?,S02E30,155
"Oh, Teddy, it's right out there.",S02E30,156
That shack on the Lake?,S02E30,157
"Ivy, you said it was a nice house.",S02E30,158
"No, I said it was an ice house.",S02E30,159
"But I'll admit, I do run my words together.",S02E30,160
"- Oh yes, we made it! - Well, here we are.",S02E30,161
"Oh, Teddy, let me give you the tour.",S02E30,162
"- Any questions? - Uh, just one.",S02E30,163
Is that the bathroom?,S02E30,164
Oh no.,S02E30,165
That's our fishing hole.,S02E30,166
That's where we catch our dinner.,S02E30,167
"Ivy, could I talk to you for a sec?",S02E30,168
Let me give you girls some privacy.,S02E30,169
You tricked me!,S02E30,170
I knew you wouldn't come if I told you the truth.,S02E30,171
"Yeah, you're right, I totally wouldn't have come!",S02E30,172
"Ugh, stop complaining.",S02E30,173
It's not so bad.,S02E30,174
There is a hole in the floor.,S02E30,175
Everything okay in here?,S02E30,176
"Oh yes, it is.",S02E30,177
What is the point of a curtain if she can hear us?,S02E30,178
I don't know. And why are you still whispering?,S02E30,179
Those are two good questions.,S02E30,180
"So, uh, what did you guys wanna talk to me about?",S02E30,181
We'll ask the questions around here.,S02E30,182
Now why did you teach Charlie that bad word?,S02E30,183
- What bad word? - Don't play dumb with me!,S02E30,184
All right? We can do this the easy way or the hard way.,S02E30,185
"- Your choice, punk! - Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Whoa whoa!",S02E30,186
"Sweetie, sweetie, why don't you go take a break?",S02E30,187
Go take a break.,S02E30,188
Lme talk to the boy.,S02E30,189
"Wow, your old mom's pretty riled up, huh?",S02E30,190
"You know, Gabe, sometimes we make mistakes.",S02E30,191
But the important thing is to tell the truth.,S02E30,192
"You can tell your old dad the truth, right?",S02E30,193
"Dad, you can stop.",S02E30,194
I know what you're doing.,S02E30,195
- What do you mean? - You're playing good cop/bad cop.,S02E30,196
"What honey, he's onto us!",S02E30,197
"- Oh, man! - Yeah, and there's a little problem with your theory.",S02E30,198
"For me to teach Charlie a bad word,",S02E30,199
I'd actually have to spend time with her.,S02E30,200
You're free to go.,S02E30,201
- Charlie said a bad word? - Mm-hmm.,S02E30,202
- What was it? - We think you know.,S02E30,203
"No, I don't.",S02E30,204
That's terrible.,S02E30,205
What does it mean?,S02E30,206
You're free to go.,S02E30,207
"And since Charlie spends a lot of time in our backyard,",S02E30,208
We think she might have heard something.,S02E30,209
From your side of the fence.,S02E30,210
What are you accusing me of?,S02E30,211
Charlie said a bad word and we think.,S02E30,212
She might have learned it from you.,S02E30,213
What was the word?,S02E30,214
I wasn't saying it to you!,S02E30,215
You sure won't be saying it twice.,S02E30,216
"Teddy, I'd like for you to meet old Betsy.",S02E30,217
There's a little story that goes along with her.,S02E30,218
"Oh, hold on a second, dad.",S02E30,219
Go ahead.,S02E30,220
Betsy was a present from my grandfather.,S02E30,221
Yeah.,S02E30,222
He carved her handle from a tree behind his house.,S02E30,223
I've had her since I was 10 years old.,S02E30,224
"All right, let's get her in the water.",S02E30,225
"Harry, let Teddy do it.",S02E30,226
"I don't think that's a good idea, Mary Lou,",S02E30,227
Especially after what happened to Gracie,S02E30,228
Which I've forgotten about.,S02E30,229
"Harry, Teddy is our guest.",S02E30,230
Now make a gesture.,S02E30,231
I don't wanna make a gesture!,S02E30,232
He doesn't have to make a gesture.,S02E30,233
"Harry, gesture!",S02E30,234
Here.,S02E30,235
"All right, cast away.",S02E30,236
Not bad for a rookie.,S02E30,237
"Thanks, I've been holding stuff.",S02E30,238
Since I was little.,S02E30,239
And now the excitement begins.,S02E30,240
Is the excitement still beginning or,S02E30,241
Are we are we in it now?,S02E30,242
"Harry, can you give me a hand?",S02E30,243
Oh yes yes.,S02E30,244
Good good.,S02E30,245
- Have fun.,S02E30,246
I'm off to the restroom.,S02E30,247
- Where is it?.,S02E30,248
It's a nasty outhouse.,S02E30,249
All the way across the freezing Lake.,S02E30,250
"But it's away from my parents, so I enjoy it.",S02E30,251
Oh!,S02E30,252
Betsy! Noooo!,S02E30,253
Oh no!,S02E30,254
They canceled Tears of Tomorrow.,S02E30,255
What?!,S02E30,256
"But it's been on for, like, 50 years. Why now?",S02E30,257
It says our generation doesn't respond to it.,S02E30,258
That's crazy.,S02E30,259
"You know, maybe if the kids.",S02E30,260
Put down all the phones and the video games and the gadgets.,S02E30,261
And actually watched the darn program,S02E30,262
Do you think we're spending too much time with Mrs. Dabney?,S02E30,263
Hogwash.,S02E30,264
- That's her.,S02E30,265
- I guess we have to tell her.,S02E30,266
"Hello, boys.",S02E30,267
Mrs.,S02E30,268
"Dabney, come on in.",S02E30,269
Have a seat.,S02E30,270
We have some bad news.,S02E30,271
"- Bad news, you say? - Yes.",S02E30,272
- What is it? - What's what?,S02E30,273
What's the bad news?,S02E30,274
You'd better sit down.,S02E30,275
I am sitting.,S02E30,276
"Well, there's nothing left to say but",S02E30,277
It's over.,S02E30,278
What's over?,S02E30,279
They canceled,S02E30,280
The Tears of Tomorrow.,S02E30,281
What?! No!{\i0},S02E30,282
I oh!,S02E30,283
- Did she faint? - Or is she,S02E30,284
So all we're having for dinner is rice?,S02E30,285
"Well, usually there's fish on top of it.",S02E30,286
But someone lost our means of catching fish.,S02E30,287
"And by that, I mean old Betsy.",S02E30,288
"And by someone, I mean you.",S02E30,289
"Mr. Wentz, I promise, right when we get home",S02E30,290
I'll get you another fishing pole.,S02E30,291
And are you gonna raise my grandfather from the dead to carve it?,S02E30,292
"Harry, can I talk to you for a minute in private?",S02E30,293
You have got to change your attitude.,S02E30,294
Teddy is our guest!,S02E30,295
"Mary Lou, the girl is an assassin.{\i0}",S02E30,296
"First she killed Gracie, and now she's drowned Betsy!{\i0}",S02E30,297
Sure glad that's a private conversation.,S02E30,298
"You okay, Mrs. Dabney?",S02E30,299
I'll never be okay again.,S02E30,300
I don't know how I can go on without Chance Tears.,S02E30,301
"Well, at least you and chance had a lot of years together.",S02E30,302
Tiffany and I just met.,S02E30,303
"All right, come on.",S02E30,304
Let's try to find something to take our minds off our loss.,S02E30,305
Are you kidding? I've been watching that show forever.,S02E30,306
You think I'm gonna replace it just like that?,S02E30,307
"Hey, what's this?{\i0}",S02E30,308
"Though time may pass, you will never be far{\i0}",S02E30,309
From The Edge of Yesterday.{\i0},S02E30,310
"Ooh, that looks good.",S02E30,311
I can't believe we never found out.,S02E30,312
Who taught Charlie that word.,S02E30,313
"I don't know, Bob.",S02E30,314
Maybe it's not important where she learned it.,S02E30,315
What's important is that we teach Charlie.,S02E30,316
That cursing is wrong.,S02E30,317
And I think we've done that.,S02E30,318
"How about a turn signal, you",S02E30,319
Case closed.,S02E30,320
Ivy.,S02E30,321
Ivy.,S02E30,322
"- Ivy, Ivy. - What?",S02E30,323
I have to go to the bathroom.,S02E30,324
- Where is it? - It's an outhouse.,S02E30,325
You go outside and you follow the stench.,S02E30,326
Thank you.,S02E30,327
Whoa!,S02E30,328
What was that? Teddy fell in the Lake!{\i0},S02E30,329
"- Oh my goodness, come on! - Oh, Teddy!",S02E30,330
Pull! Everybody pull hard!,S02E30,331
Come on! All right.,S02E30,332
"Oh, what's that? What's going on?",S02E30,333
- Aah! - Wow.,S02E30,334
"Hey, you caught a fish.",S02E30,335
"Whoa, and it's a beauty.",S02E30,336
Look.,S02E30,337
"Look, there's a line in its mouth.",S02E30,338
What?,S02E30,339
"Oh. Oh, Betsy!",S02E30,340
"Oh, I missed you so much, baby.",S02E30,341
"Teddy, honey, are you okay?",S02E30,342
"Yeah, no, I'm just I'm fine.",S02E30,343
I'm just kind of cold.,S02E30,344
"- Okay. - Well, Teddy,",S02E30,345
Looks like you've redeemed yourself.,S02E30,346
You are officially invited back next year.,S02E30,347
Noooo!,S02E30,348
"Well, Charlie, a big life lesson today",S02E30,349
"See, when someone says they have a house on the Lake,",S02E30,350
They might mean they have a house on the Lake.,S02E30,351
"Kind of an offbeat lesson, but",S02E30,352
"Well, not really a lesson at all.",S02E30,353
Give me a break.,S02E30,354
I've gotta do a lot of these.,S02E30,355
"Well, at least one person in the family.",S02E30,356
Learned something.,S02E30,357
Can I go now? This is boring.,S02E30,358
- No! - Yeah?,S02E30,359
"Well, if you think I'm gonna sit in this chair.",S02E30,360
"The entire 20 minutes, ho ho, good luck, Charlie.",S02E30,361
Couldn't have said it better myself.,S02E30,362
From the heartaches of today{\i0},S02E30,363
Come The Tears of Tomorrow.{\i0},S02E30,364
You can't threaten me.,S02E30,365

"Hello, Chance.",S02E30,367
Amanda!,S02E30,368
What are you doing here?,S02E30,369
That's what I'd like to know.,S02E30,370

Chance Clone!,S02E30,373

Me too,S02E30,379
I'm confuse.,S02E30,380

Who cares?,S02E30,382
You take two.,S02E30,383

"-Without mom? -Well, it's about your mom.",S03E01,2
We need to talk about her pregnancy.,S03E01,3

I thought you guys were gonna stop after one kid.,S03E01,5
I was hoping two.,S03E01,6
-Three.,S03E01,7
-Four.,S03E01,8
Anyway,S03E01,9
We have reached that wonderful moment in your mother's pregnancy.,S03E01,10
When she gets uncomfortable. And when your mother is uncomfortable,S03E01,11
-We're uncomfortable.,S03E01,12
-Exactly.,S03E01,13
The third trimester is when your mom gets a little,S03E01,14
-Scary? -Mean?,S03E01,15
-Nasty? -Icky?,S03E01,16
"So until further notice,",S03E01,17
"Whenever your mother asks you something,",S03E01,18
The answer is yes.,S03E01,19
What if she asks me if my name is Ralph?,S03E01,20
-Why would she do that? -Why wouldn't she do that?,S03E01,21
Morning.,S03E01,22
-It is a good morning.,S03E01,23

"So how are you feeling, honey?",S03E01,31
'Cause you look terrific.,S03E01,32

"Hey, Charlie, the basement is a mess. After breakfast,",S03E01,34
-I want you to go downstairs and pick up your toys. -No!,S03E01,35
What did you say to me?,S03E01,36
Yes!,S03E01,37
Today's all burnt toast ,S03E01,38
"Running late, and dad jokes",S03E01,39
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S03E01,40
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S03E01,41
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S03E01,42
There it is up on the roof,S03E01,43
"I've been there, I've survived",S03E01,44
So just take my advice,S03E01,45

You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S03E01,54
"Hang in there, baby.",S03E01,55
Another great day at super adventure land.,S03E01,56
Eight shows in the hot sun for minimum wage?,S03E01,57
"-What's so great about it? -It's sarcasm, Spencer.",S03E01,58
Here's another example: You smell delightful.,S03E01,59
"You're a little rank yourself, cinder-smella.",S03E01,60
-I'm so glad we're back together.,S03E01,61

"Oh, I heard that there's an opening.",S03E01,66
In patriotic Plaza to play George and Martha Washington.,S03E01,67
-How do you know that? -I overheard Betsy Ross.,S03E01,68
In the bathroom.,S03E01,69
She was in the stall next to Harriet Tubman.,S03E01,70
They can always tell when Abe Lincoln's in the stall.,S03E01,71
The hat.,S03E01,72
"Anyways so, um, George and Martha Washington.",S03E01,73
Were fired Because they called in sick when they weren't.,S03E01,74
So the father of our country can tell a lie.,S03E01,75
That was very witty.,S03E01,76
Thanks.,S03E01,77
"You're still not getting the sarcasm, are ya?",S03E01,78
Somebody's been stealing my newspapers.,S03E01,79

"You know, the information super-highway.",S03E01,88
Stop talking gibberish.,S03E01,89
Where is my newspaper?,S03E01,90
We don't have your newspaper.,S03E01,91
"All right, almost done with my school proj",S03E01,92
"Hey, Mrs.",S03E01,93
Dabney.,S03E01,94
I should have known you were the newspaper thief.,S03E01,95
"No, I'm not the only guilty one here.",S03E01,96
It was a two-man job.,S03E01,97

I've been carrying that around since Gabe was born.,S03E01,108
I knew this sweet day would come.,S03E01,109

Been carrying that around too.,S03E01,111
"Um, honey,",S03E01,112

I went in the backyard.,S03E01,114
There was cat poop on the lawn.,S03E01,115

We're have to move because some cats.,S03E01,118
"-Did his business on the lawn? -Oh, let me finish.",S03E01,119
"Okay, the cat made me think that it would be nice.",S03E01,120
To have a pet someday.,S03E01,121
"And then I thought, we don't have room for a pet!",S03E01,122
And then I realized we don't have room for a baby.,S03E01,123
"I mean, he or she should have their own room, right?",S03E01,124
"Excuse me, I'm not clear are we moving or getting a pet?",S03E01,125
"We need a new house. What do you think, Bob?",S03E01,126
"Um, well, we",S03E01,127

I will deal with you later.,S03E01,130
"No no, it wasn't that.",S03E01,131
"Honey, look, I understand your feelings.",S03E01,132

"-Good boy. -If we are going down the pet road,",S03E01,135
Could we get a monkey?,S03E01,136
'Cause I have this little cowboy hat.,S03E01,137
That I have never known what to do with.,S03E01,138
"Shall we rehearse for our audition, Mr. Washington?",S03E01,139
"Hit it, Mrs.",S03E01,140
Washington.,S03E01,141
"Many years ago, after the war was won",S03E01,142
-We needed a leader. -How bout Washington?,S03E01,143
He was just the man.,S03E01,144
To take his country farther.,S03E01,145
-And the woman behind him -Was his loving wife Martha.,S03E01,146
"Where are you going, general George?",S03E01,147
I'm off to fight at valley forge.,S03E01,148
But first I'll lead them cross the water.,S03E01,149
That's what put him on the quarter!,S03E01,150
"So long, my dear, I'll miss your smile.",S03E01,151
"Here, why don't you keep it awhile?",S03E01,152

"-It's the new baby's room! -Do you love it, mom?",S03E01,160
We spent almost an hour on it.,S03E01,161
So the baby will be sleeping.,S03E01,162
Under the stairs.,S03E01,163
Like Harry Potter?,S03E01,164
"Hey,",S03E01,165
"Harry Potter, now he had some fun adventures, huh?",S03E01,166
Huh? Say something good about Harry Potter.,S03E01,167
Quiddich!,S03E01,168
"Honey, look",S03E01,169
"You know what? Look, how easy it's gonna be.",S03E01,170
"To pull the baby out of the crib, huh?",S03E01,171
Almost too easy!,S03E01,172
That would never happen in real life.,S03E01,173
"You've dropped em before, you'll drop em again.",S03E01,174
"Hey, mom, check this out.",S03E01,175
"If the baby gets fussy, calm the little munchkin.",S03E01,176
With an ocean view.,S03E01,177
Hey!,S03E01,178
"New house, Bob. Got it?",S03E01,179
Uh-oh. Shark!,S03E01,180
-What's all this? -Everything you've ever.,S03E01,181
"Thrown, shot or fired into my house.",S03E01,182
"Oh boy, you were a disappointment.",S03E01,183
Why are you giving all this stuff back?,S03E01,184
"Gabe, now that you're moving away, I've been thinking:",S03E01,185
"You and I have had our differences,",S03E01,186
but the truth is you've made my life more interesting.,S03E01,187
You've kept me young.,S03E01,188
I haven't done a very good job.,S03E01,189
There's that sense of humor I'll miss so much.,S03E01,190
"Hey, it's my favorite baseball cap.",S03E01,191
Remember when you lost that?,S03E01,192
"Yeah, I was trying to plant a stink bomb in your flower bed.",S03E01,193
"You know, Mrs. Dabney, after all these years,",S03E01,194
that's the first nice moment we've ever shared.,S03E01,195
"Bye, now.",S03E01,196
"Guys, what are we doing here? What's the big surprise?",S03E01,197
This is your new house!,S03E01,198
-What? -We're really moving?,S03E01,199
But I love our old house.,S03E01,200
You'll like the new house even more.,S03E01,201
-Can't we at least talk about this? -We just did.,S03E01,202
-So we sold our old house already? -Nope!,S03E01,203
Still own that one.,S03E01,204
Normally you sell the old house first.,S03E01,205
But now we own two houses.,S03E01,206
Yay.,S03E01,207
"And in this house, everyone gets their own room.",S03E01,208
Do I finally get out of the basement?,S03E01,209
You sure do.,S03E01,210
"Uh, here your bedroom is on",S03E01,211
Level b-1!,S03E01,212
"Ugh, man,",S03E01,213
It's kinda hot in here.,S03E01,214
Why are you all staring at me?,S03E01,215
Why is my cap full of hair?,S03E01,216
I know where your cap got it.,S03E01,217
Ahh!,S03E01,218
Dabney!,S03E01,219
I got him.,S03E01,220
"Charlie, you like your new home, don't you?",S03E01,221
"No, mommy!",S03E01,222
Charlie!,S03E01,223
Is something on your mind?,S03E01,224
Or should I say not on your mind?,S03E01,225
You put hair removal goo in my cap!,S03E01,226
That was for stealing my newspapers.,S03E01,227
And the funny part is I got the idea on the Internet.,S03E01,228
This isn't over.,S03E01,229
"Oh, but I think it is.",S03E01,230
You're moving away and I get the last laugh.,S03E01,231
Ha ha ha!,S03E01,232
"No, you're not gonna get the last laugh!",S03E01,233
I'm getting the last laugh! And it's gonna sound like this:,S03E01,234
-Ha ha ha ha! -Ha ha ha ha!,S03E01,235
-Ha ha ha! -Ha ha ha!,S03E01,236
Ha!,S03E01,237
We have a complicated relationship.,S03E01,238
Hi.,S03E01,239
I just got your text.,S03E01,240
-You're moving? -Yeah.,S03E01,241
We are.,S03E01,242
I'm kinda sad about it.,S03E01,243
I'm gonna miss this place.,S03E01,244
"Um, well,",S03E01,245
Here's some more bad news.,S03E01,246
Super adventure land called,S03E01,247
"Oh, and we didn't get it?",S03E01,248
"Actually, you didn't get it.",S03E01,249
"But you did? Oh, but did you tell them.",S03E01,250
That you weren't gonna do the show without me?,S03E01,251
"Well, I was gonna,",S03E01,252
"But it's supposed to be really hot next week, so",S03E01,253
Oh great.,S03E01,254
So I'm stuck kissing a sweaty frog.,S03E01,255
"-Pretty much, yeah. -So who's playing Martha Washington?",S03E01,256
-Sandy Super. -Who?,S03E01,257
Milt Super's niece.,S03E01,258
"You know, the guy who founded super adventure land.",S03E01,259
"Wait, is Sandy Super.",S03E01,260
That really cute girl who's always staring at you.,S03E01,261
And asking you out and pretending I don't exist?,S03E01,262
-So you do know her.,S03E01,263
-Oh.,S03E01,264
"Well, maybe the new frog will be really cute too.",S03E01,265
"Actually,",S03E01,266
They're giving that part to the guy who runs the tilt-a-whirl.,S03E01,267
Greasy Joe?,S03E01,268
-Afraid so.,S03E01,269
-Don't you have to have teeth.,S03E01,270
-To play a frog? -Afraid not.,S03E01,271
Two house payments.,S03E01,272
"Hey, dad,",S03E01,273
Can I,S03E01,274
Whoa. What's going on with you eye?,S03E01,275
Your mother has ideas.,S03E01,276
Expensive ideas.,S03E01,277
That's okay.,S03E01,278
I'll just look at the other eye.,S03E01,279
"So, dad, quick question,",S03E01,280
How long do you think it would take to dig a pit?,S03E01,281
"-How big a pit? -Eh, I don't know.",S03E01,282
About as tall and as wide as Mrs.,S03E01,283
dabney.,S03E01,284
"Gabe, what are you up to?",S03E01,285
-How much do you want to know? -Is it gonna cost me any money?,S03E01,286
-No.,S03E01,287
-Happy digging.,S03E01,288
"Where are you going, general George?",S03E01,289
I'm off to fight at valley forge.,S03E01,290
But first I'll lead them cross the water.,S03E01,291
"Take me too, I think you oughter.",S03E01,292
-Teddy? -Who's Teddy?,S03E01,293
I'm Ben Franklin.,S03E01,294
"Uh, what are you doing here, Ben?",S03E01,295
"Yeah, you're not in this show.",S03E01,296
She means this part of history.,S03E01,297
"Oh, George, George,",S03E01,298
Everyone knows you didn't go to valley forge.,S03E01,299
To save our country.,S03E01,300
You went because you and Martha.,S03E01,301
Were having problems.,S03E01,302
"-What? -So you turned to your best friend,",S03E01,303
"Ben Franklin, who's always been there for you.",S03E01,304
"-No, he didn't.",S03E01,305
"-Oh yes, he did.",S03E01,306
"Then Martha was comforted by Thomas Jefferson,",S03E01,307
played in this performance by greasy Joe.,S03E01,308
Oh Joe!,S03E01,309
Joe!,S03E01,310
Quit gummin' on that corndog and get out here!,S03E01,311
And that's how America got started.,S03E01,312
"-C'mon, Charlie. -No!",S03E01,313
-What's going on in here? -We've got a situation.,S03E01,314
Someone is refusing to pack.,S03E01,315
"Oh, Charlie honey, you have to pack your toys",S03E01,316
So we can take them to the new house.,S03E01,317
No! I'm staying!,S03E01,318
"Yeah, actually I kinda want to stay here too.",S03E01,319
P.,S03E01,320
J.,S03E01,321
", you're not helping.",S03E01,322
But I have so many great memories at this house.,S03E01,323
"Like, when I got my head stuck in the swing set.",S03E01,324
"Honey, you're gonna get your head stuck.",S03E01,325
In lots of places at the new house.,S03E01,326
Promise?,S03E01,327
I really Hope this one's another girl.,S03E01,328
"Okay, Charlie, what's it gonna take.",S03E01,329
To get you in a new house today?,S03E01,330
-Pony.,S03E01,331
-Done.,S03E01,332
Bob!,S03E01,333
"Hey, what just happened in there?",S03E01,334
"Well, I think we found out.",S03E01,335
That Sandy's no good at improv.,S03E01,336
"Teddy, are you really jealous of Sandy Super?",S03E01,337
"No, why would I be jealous.",S03E01,338
Of somebody who's cute and smart.,S03E01,339
And rich?,S03E01,340
"Look, Teddy, you have nothing to worry about.",S03E01,341
There's no one in the world who I'd rather be with than you.,S03E01,342
-Really? -Really.,S03E01,343
"George Washington,",S03E01,344
You're the best boyfriend I've ever had.,S03E01,345
"And you're the best girlfriend I ever had, Ben Franklin.",S03E01,346
"Oh, come here.",S03E01,347
I'm gonna teach you something about electricity.,S03E01,348
Oh yeah.,S03E01,349
"Well, Charlie, this is it:",S03E01,350
Our last few moments on edgewood drive.,S03E01,351
I gotta say I'm gonna miss this place.,S03E01,352
"Come on, Teddy, let's go.",S03E01,353
I'll edit that out later.,S03E01,354
"Well, see you at the new house.",S03E01,355
"Good luck, Charlie.",S03E01,356
Okay.,S03E01,357
You know what? I'll be right out.,S03E01,358
I feel like I forgot something.,S03E01,359
"Welcome home, P.",S03E01,360
J.,S03E01,361
This is where you're going to grow up.,S03E01,362
-No-ooo! -Hey hey.,S03E01,363
"We are stopping at two, right?",S03E01,364
"Well, actually",S03E01,365
Aw no.,S03E01,366
Gabe is such an easy baby.,S03E01,367
I Hope he'll always be like this.,S03E01,368
Then all the little ducklings found their way home.,S03E01,369
And lived happily ever after.,S03E01,370
Thank you.,S03E01,371
"Honey, find what you were looking for?",S03E01,372
I did.,S03E01,373
"We can't move, Bob.",S03E01,374
What?,S03E01,375
I carried all four kids through that door.,S03E01,376
I want to do the same with number five.,S03E01,377
What's going on?,S03E01,378
We're not moving.,S03E01,379
"We're not moving! Hey hey, unpack the truck!",S03E01,380
Are you kidding? That's awesome.,S03E01,381
We're staying right here.,S03E01,382
In our home.,S03E01,383
"Come on, people, let's get out of here!",S03E01,384
We're not moving.,S03E01,385
Mom changed her mind.,S03E01,386
What?!,S03E01,387
"No no no, we have to go! Right now!",S03E01,388
Whoa whoa whoa.,S03E01,389
What did you do?,S03E01,390
-I didn't do anything. -Help!,S03E01,391
Ignore that.,S03E01,392
What's going on?,S03E01,393
That little monster covered my entire porch with glue.,S03E01,394
Even the mail.,S03E01,395
"-Gabe, why did you do that? -I had to get the last laugh.",S03E01,396
"Okay, but that's not funny.",S03E01,397
It's kinda funny.,S03E01,398
-A little help here.,S03E01,399
"-Okay, hang on, Mrs.",S03E01,400
dabney.,S03E01,401
-We'll get you unstuck.,S03E01,402
-I got it.,S03E01,403
-Uh -Wai,S03E01,404
I don't got it.,S03E01,405
"Well, Charlie, we're back to being a one-house family.",S03E01,406
A one-home family.,S03E01,407
And we couldn't be happier.,S03E01,408
I'll edit that out later.,S03E01,409
"Oh, so Spencer and I were fired.",S03E01,410
From super adventure land.,S03E01,411
"Apparently, Ben Franklin.",S03E01,412
Kissing George Washington was deemed.,S03E01,413
Historically inaccurate.,S03E01,414
Although they did like each other,S03E01,415
A lot.,S03E01,416
"Hey, guys,",S03E01,417
PJ got his head stuck in the swing set again.,S03E01,418
Okay.,S03E01,419
I'll get my tools.,S03E01,420
I'll get the butter.,S03E01,421
There's no place like home.,S03E01,422
"Good luck, Charlie.",S03E01,423
"Many years ago, the founders",S03E01,424
of super adventure land gathered for a very important meeting.,S03E01,425
"Gentlemen, we've built this beautiful theme park,",S03E01,426
Now all we need is a name.,S03E01,427
I know.,S03E01,428
We'll call it land of adventure super.,S03E01,429
"Of course you'd put your name first, Richard land.",S03E01,430
"Well then, what do you suggest, Frank adventure?",S03E01,431
Something that rolls right off the tongue.,S03E01,432
Adventure of super land.,S03E01,433
That's not bad.,S03E01,434
Not bad.,S03E01,435
Let me make one slight adjustment.,S03E01,436
We'll call it: Super land of adventure.,S03E01,437
Gentlemen.,S03E01,438
Terrible news! We've just got this telegram.,S03E01,439
Arthur Of,S03E01,440
Is dead.,S03E01,441
Of's been offed?,S03E01,442
I'm afraid so.,S03E01,443
"With Arthur Of gone, it's down to just the three of us:",S03E01,444
"Super, adventure, land.",S03E01,445
"Betty, put on a pot of coffee.",S03E01,446
We're gonna be here awhile.,S03E01,447
"Gabe, be totally honest.",S03E02,0
"For a pregnant woman,",S03E02,1
"I'm really smoking, aren't I?",S03E02,2
Yeah.,S03E02,3
I think silence is my best option here.,S03E02,4
Okay.,S03E02,5
"Well, I'm off to yoga.",S03E02,6
"Oh hey, before you go",S03E02,7
This silly old thing.,S03E02,8
Can I get a quick signature for this thing for school?,S03E02,9
A school thing? Oh.,S03E02,10
I Hope this isn't another note from your principal.,S03E02,11
"Oh, look at that.",S03E02,12
"Yes, that's interesting.",S03E02,13
It's gotten to the point where dear Mrs.,S03E02,14
duncan is a stamp.,S03E02,15
You released a bag of crickets in the library?,S03E02,16
-Why? -Crickets are noisy.,S03E02,17
The library is quiet.,S03E02,18
You try things.,S03E02,19
"Let's see. I could try things like grounding you,",S03E02,20
"-Cutting your allowance -Wow, mom,",S03E02,21
"Now that I'm getting a better look at you,",S03E02,22
You are smoking.,S03E02,23
-You really think so? -Yeah.,S03E02,24
"Forget it, mister.",S03E02,25
You've gone too far this time.,S03E02,26
Your father and I will discuss your punishment later.,S03E02,27
"All right, fine,",S03E02,28
But you still have to sign this.,S03E02,29
Wish I had a stamp.,S03E02,30
Today's all burnt toast ,S03E02,31
"Running late, and dad jokes",S03E02,32
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S03E02,33
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S03E02,34
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S03E02,35
There it is up on the roof,S03E02,36
"I've been there, I've survived",S03E02,37
So just take my advice,S03E02,38
"Hang in there, baby",S03E02,39
Things are crazy,S03E02,40
But I know your future's bright,S03E02,41
"Hang in there, baby",S03E02,42
There's no maybe,S03E02,43
Everything turns out all right,S03E02,44
Your life is up and down,S03E02,45
But trust me it comes back around,S03E02,46
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S03E02,47
"Hang in there, baby.",S03E02,48
I'm so glad we're back together.,S03E02,49
I know.,S03E02,50
Me too.,S03E02,51
"You know, I feel like when we're happy,",S03E02,52
-The whole world is happy.,S03E02,53
-Right.,S03E02,54
-Guess again. -Oh hey!,S03E02,55
Wouldn't it be fun cute couple nicknamese.,S03E02,56
Where we combine our two names?,S03E02,57
-Like brangelina.,S03E02,58
-Yeah yeah yeah.,S03E02,59
"Right, okay. So",S03E02,60
Spencer and Teddy.,S03E02,61
"Oh, we could be spendy! Do you like spendy?",S03E02,62
I'd like for spendy to hit me over the head with a club.,S03E02,63
"Well, I gotta go",S03E02,64
-Basketball practice.,S03E02,65
-All right.,S03E02,66
"See ya later, spendy.",S03E02,67
I like it.,S03E02,68
"Ivy, why are people giving me dirty looks?",S03E02,69
"Hmm, it could be anything really",S03E02,70
"Your pants, your shirt,",S03E02,71
"The fact that you're a jinx, your hair.",S03E02,72
Wait.,S03E02,73
Whoa whoa.,S03E02,74
"Okay, go go back.",S03E02,75
I'm a jinx? Why would people think that?,S03E02,76
"Well, ever since you and spencer got back together,",S03E02,77
The basketball team hasn't won a game.,S03E02,78
But that's ridiculous.,S03E02,79
"Ivy, come on.",S03E02,80
"-You don't think I am a jinx, don't you？ -Well I, don't,",S03E02,81
"But the basketball team does,",S03E02,82
"The coach does, the janitor rse,",S03E02,83
I am not a jinx!,S03E02,84
"If anything, I'm good luck.",S03E02,85
Sorry.,S03E02,86
"Hey, looking good, Charlie.",S03E02,87
"I know, daddy.",S03E02,88
"Yeah, you are your mother's daughter, all right.",S03E02,89
"Oh, I'm next! I'll take the race car.",S03E02,90
"Hey, P.",S03E02,91
J.,S03E02,92
", P.",S03E02,93
J.,S03E02,94
Manager asked me to talk to you.,S03E02,95
-About what? -Come here.,S03E02,96
He seems to think you're a little old to sit in the race car.,S03E02,97
"All right. I'll sit on the elephant,",S03E02,98
But my engine noises won't make any sense.,S03E02,99
Hey.,S03E02,100
You're old enough to vote.,S03E02,101
You're old enough to go to a real barbershop.,S03E02,102
But real barbershops don't give out stickers and lollipops.,S03E02,103
Maybe you can hold off on the voting for a little while.,S03E02,104
"Hey, you know what? I'll take you to where I get my hair cut.",S03E02,105
"Uh, no thanks.",S03E02,106
You're 18.,S03E02,107
Time to leave the orange balloon and grow up.,S03E02,108
"Oh, great, rub it in my face.",S03E02,109
Can you believe what Gabe did?,S03E02,110
"No, I can't.",S03E02,111
"I mean, everybody knows when you transport crickets.",S03E02,112
"You don't use a bag, you use a lightly-ventilated box.",S03E02,113
"Focus! Bob, we have to punish him.",S03E02,114
"Man, he's been a handful lately.",S03E02,115
I know.,S03E02,116
"Well, at least we don't have it as bad as my friend Pam.",S03E02,117
She's one of the pregnant gals in my yoga class.,S03E02,118
She has a son Gabe's age who's so out of control.,S03E02,119
They're sending him to military school.,S03E02,120
Military school?,S03E02,121
"It's the only way, Bob.",S03E02,122
You can't have.,S03E02,123
A troublemaker like him around with a new baby on the way.,S03E02,124
"Still, I mean,",S03E02,125
Isn't that kinda harsh for a kid Gabe's age?,S03E02,126
"What he needs is discipline,",S03E02,127
And that's what a school like Graystone academy can give him.,S03E02,128
"Yeah, I guess. Hey, does he know it's happening?",S03E02,129
"No, the trick is not to tell him.",S03E02,130
"Then one day you say, hey, buddy, get in the car.",S03E02,131
We're going for ice cream.,S03E02,132
Then off you go to military school.,S03E02,133
-Wow.,S03E02,134
"I don't know if I -It's done, Bob.",S03E02,135
And what do you care? It's not like him leaving.,S03E02,136
Is gonna affect your life one way or the other.,S03E02,137
"Yeah, that's true.",S03E02,138
"Excuse me, quick question:",S03E02,139
Do you give out prizes with your haircuts?,S03E02,140
"Yeah, if I Nick you, you get a free bandage.",S03E02,141
"That's a joke, right?",S03E02,142
Okay.,S03E02,143
"Wow, I've really got to cut down on the coffee.",S03E02,144
"You know,",S03E02,145
I'm actually thinking about letting it grow out anyways.,S03E02,146
-Syd! -Hi.,S03E02,147
-Hey.,S03E02,148
-Have a seat.,S03E02,149
"Well, since I'm here.",S03E02,150
-What's your name? -I'm P.,S03E02,151
J.,S03E02,152
So what kind of cut would you like today?,S03E02,153
"Uh, well,",S03E02,154
"Normally I go for the handsome prince,",S03E02,155
But today I'm thinking about changing to the sporty rascal.,S03E02,156
"Well, P.",S03E02,157
J.,S03E02,158
", I think it's time we gave you more of an adult look.",S03E02,159
How about we go,S03E02,160
Shorter on the sides.,S03E02,161
And then we can layer it on top?,S03E02,162
Okay.,S03E02,163
Or we could go shorter on top.,S03E02,164
And then leave it fuller in the back.,S03E02,165
Whatever takes the longest.,S03E02,166
"Come on, let's get you shampooed.",S03E02,167
We're gonna get me shampooed.,S03E02,168
"Okay, don't sugarcoat it.",S03E02,169
Does everyone think that I'm a jinx?,S03E02,170
Yes.,S03E02,171
"Boy, no sugar there.",S03E02,172
"Teddy, I'm sorry, all right? It's one of those,",S03E02,173
"-You know, sports superstition things.",S03E02,174
-But it's so stupid.,S03E02,175
"Yeah, I know, but everyone believes it.",S03E02,176
"Well, then we'll just have to convince them that I'm not a jinx.",S03E02,177
-How do we do that? -You could play better.,S03E02,178
That's obviously not gonna happen.,S03E02,179
I guess you've never heard of a sugarcoat either.,S03E02,180
I've got it We have to break up.,S03E02,181
-Whoa.,S03E02,182
Break up? -We don't need to break up for real.,S03E02,183
"We'll fake break up,",S03E02,184
"The team will think the jinx is gone,",S03E02,185
"They'll relax, you guys can win again.",S03E02,186
That could work.,S03E02,187
"Okay, so what's our story?",S03E02,188
-Why are we breaking up? -I met someone else.,S03E02,189
"-Okay, but who? -Serge Lefleur.",S03E02,190
-Excuse me? -Serge was.,S03E02,191
My imaginary boyfriend when I was eight.,S03E02,192
He he had a velvet beret.,S03E02,193
And rode a unicycle.,S03E02,194
So your imaginary boyfriend was a mime.,S03E02,195
"Yeah, a mime who could make a layup.",S03E02,196
Hey!,S03E02,197
You won't believe this,S03E02,198
Mom and dad are sending me to military school.,S03E02,199
"Oh, this is terrible!",S03E02,200
"Well, maybe for you,",S03E02,201
But I just doubled my living space.,S03E02,202
How can you say that?,S03E02,203
"What, did I get the math wrong?",S03E02,204
"I mean, I know I've been bad,",S03E02,205
But how can they just send me away?,S03E02,206
"Well, you gotta hand it to mom and dad",S03E02,207
"When you're adding a new kid,",S03E02,208
You kinda wanna get rid of an old one.,S03E02,209
What about you? You'll be leaving for college soon.,S03E02,210
"Gabe, everyone knows I'm not going anywhere.",S03E02,211
"Right, Charlie?",S03E02,212
-True dat.,S03E02,213
-Mmm.,S03E02,214
They're sending me to some place called Graystone academy.,S03E02,215
Graystone academy.,S03E02,216
"Ah, found it. Graystone academy:",S03E02,217
Breaking boys' spirits since 1873.,S03E02,218
"Okay, there there has gotta be some way out of this.",S03E02,219
"Well, I'm not very good at thinking of things.",S03E02,220
"Okay, go on.",S03E02,221
"No, that's it.",S03E02,222
I'm not very good at thinking of things.,S03E02,223
I've got it.,S03E02,224
I'll just start behaving better.,S03E02,225
"If I show mom and dad how good I can be,",S03E02,226
Then they'll never send me away.,S03E02,227
"Just one problem, your plan requires you to be good.",S03E02,228
You have no experience in that.,S03E02,229
"Well, I'm gonna have to learn.",S03E02,230
It's either that.,S03E02,231
-Or I'm off to military school.,S03E02,232
"-Bye-bye, Gabe.",S03E02,233
"Hey, what were you dreaming last night?",S03E02,234
-You kept kicking me.,S03E02,235
-I dreamt you were snoring.,S03E02,236
"Oh, good morning.",S03E02,237
Table for two?,S03E02,238
-What's all this? -You made us breakfast?,S03E02,239
"Not just any breakfast, dad.",S03E02,240
"Three eggs filled with pancakes,",S03E02,241
Bacon and cold pizza.,S03E02,242
You made me a boblette?,S03E02,243
"And, mom, a healthy breakfast for you",S03E02,244
Oatmeal and fresh fruits.,S03E02,245
"Okay, I wanna know what you did right now, mister.",S03E02,246
I didn't do anything.,S03E02,247
I just realized what great parents I have.,S03E02,248
This is the best boblette I've ever had.,S03E02,249
"Gabe, seriously, I wanna know",S03E02,250
"Where you got blueberries, cause they're not even in season.",S03E02,251
I'll be back later to do the dishes.,S03E02,252
"Oh and, dad,",S03E02,253
I made you lunch.,S03E02,254
I still think he's up to something.,S03E02,255
"Oh, dear lord, he made me a bob-wich.",S03E02,256
"Teddy, we have to talk right now.",S03E02,257
-About what? -About you cheating on me.,S03E02,258
"Well, I don't actu",S03E02,259
"Do we have to do this here,",S03E02,260
In front of everybody?!,S03E02,261
You were saying?,S03E02,262
-I heard you're cheating on me.,S03E02,263
-Oh.,S03E02,264
Someone saw you with,S03E02,265
With Sarge Lefloo.,S03E02,266
You mean serge lefleur?,S03E02,267
"The handsome, dashing french boy.",S03E02,268
Who doesn't go to our school?,S03E02,269
"Yeah, that guy.",S03E02,270
"Oh, hold on.",S03E02,271
Oops.,S03E02,272
"Oh, bonjour, mon petit chou-chou.",S03E02,273
Ca va?.,S03E02,274
This is awkward.,S03E02,275
-Good break-up.,S03E02,276
-You too.,S03E02,277
"-Hello, again.",S03E02,278
-P.,S03E02,279
J.,S03E02,280
", what's up?.",S03E02,281
I noticed this morning that my sideburns are a little uneven.,S03E02,282
-They are? -Uh-huh.,S03E02,283
"There, now they're even.",S03E02,284
"Yeah, but this is kinda my natural head position.",S03E02,285
It makes me seem folksy.,S03E02,286
"Okay, have a seat.",S03E02,287
Done! Now you're folksy and even.,S03E02,288
Heard the news! Up top!,S03E02,289
"-What news? -You dropped him like he's hot,",S03E02,290
-even though he's not! -Oh.,S03E02,291
"Ivy, we're actually",S03E02,292
-We're not really -I couldn't believe.,S03E02,293
You got back with that dog in the first place.,S03E02,294
Spencer and I are still together.,S03E02,295
You didn't let me finish.,S03E02,296
-I love dogs.,S03E02,297
-Yeah.,S03E02,298
"Yeah, see, we staged the break-up.",S03E02,299
"After they win the game tonight,",S03E02,300
We'll tell everyone we're still together.,S03E02,301
And they'll know I was never a jinx.,S03E02,302
-Ah. -Heard the news!,S03E02,303
Up top!,S03E02,304
-We're still together.,S03E02,305
-You didn't let me finish.,S03E02,306
Just because.,S03E02,307
"Love, Gabe.",S03E02,308
He must've done something really really bad.,S03E02,309
Has anyone seen Mrs. Dabney lately?,S03E02,310
Or maybe we're misreading this.,S03E02,311
"-What do you mean? -Honey, maybe Gabe has finally turned that corner.",S03E02,312
And maybe we should be giving him.,S03E02,313
Some positive reinforcement.,S03E02,314
"Well, I guess if he's trying to be a good kid,",S03E02,315
We could try to be good parents.,S03E02,316
New territory for all of us?,S03E02,317
"Hey, buddy.",S03E02,318
"Come on, get in the car.",S03E02,319
Get in the car? Why?,S03E02,320
-We're going for ice cream. -No!,S03E02,321
No ice cream! You can't make me!,S03E02,322
"Okay. Uh, yogurt?",S03E02,323
I know what's going on here.,S03E02,324
And I'm not going down like this!,S03E02,325
"-Get back! I won't go! -Hey, whoa whoa! Hey, Gabe!",S03E02,326
-What are you doing? -I don't want to go to military school.,S03E02,327
Military school?,S03E02,328
Don't deny it! I overheard you two talking in the kitchen.,S03E02,329
"Oh, you thought",S03E02,330
You think that you're leaving today.,S03E02,331
Your departure date is still being determined.,S03E02,332
"It all depends on how you behave, right, Bob?",S03E02,333
Right.,S03E02,334
I don't wanna go to Graystone academy.,S03E02,335
I want my spirit to be broken at home.,S03E02,336
By the people I love.,S03E02,337
"Well, I guess I could call Colonel",S03E02,338
Klink,S03E02,339
And tell him that we might reconsider.,S03E02,340
"Oh, thank you.",S03E02,341
-Thank you.,S03E02,342
-You're welcome.,S03E02,343
Now,S03E02,344
There's a bathroom upstairs that's not gonna clean itself.,S03E02,345
"Okay, I'm on it.",S03E02,346
I'm on it.,S03E02,347
Wh-wha-what What's going on?,S03E02,348
"-Who is this? -Umm, my 4:30 appointment.",S03E02,349
Why don't you head back to the shampoo station and I'll be right there?,S03E02,350
Sh-shampoo?,S03E02,351
I thought that was our thing.,S03E02,352
P.,S03E02,353
J.,S03E02,354
", you're not my only client.",S03E02,355
"Oh, so now I'm just a client?",S03E02,356
You've always been just a client.,S03E02,357
Fine.,S03E02,358
Two can play this game.,S03E02,359
"Jerry, gimme a shave, please.",S03E02,360
"Sure, kid.",S03E02,361
Have a seat.,S03E02,362
"-Oh hey, T.",S03E02,363
"-Oh hello, Ivy.",S03E02,364
"Oh, I guess you've probably heard.",S03E02,365
That Spencer and I broke up.,S03E02,366
"So my new boyfriend serge was busy,",S03E02,367
And I decided I'd come and support the team.,S03E02,368
Why are you talking like that?,S03E02,369
"Oh, Ivy, this is how I normally talk,",S03E02,370
Especially now that I'm not a jinx.,S03E02,371
"Yeah, this is gonna be a long game.",S03E02,372
"If Spencer misses this shot, we lose.",S03E02,373
Oh! Oh yes!,S03E02,374
Yes yes yes!,S03E02,375
-Whoo-hoo! -What are you doing?,S03E02,376
I'm telling the whole world we're still together!,S03E02,377
We never broke up!,S03E02,378
"And since we won, I'm not a jinx! Ha!",S03E02,379
-Teddy. -Hmm?,S03E02,380
The score is tied.,S03E02,381
Oh.,S03E02,382
My bad.,S03E02,383
I have to make this foul shot to win.,S03E02,384
Okay.,S03E02,385
"Yeah, carry on.",S03E02,386
Good luck.,S03E02,387
No pressure.,S03E02,388
"If he misses this, I would not wanna be you.",S03E02,389
Yes!,S03E02,390
-Now? -Now.,S03E02,391
-Good morning.,S03E02,392
"-Oh, good morning.",S03E02,393
The presentation just keeps getting better and better.,S03E02,394
"Well, what have we got on the menu today?",S03E02,395
I'm hoping for a breakfast bob-urrito.,S03E02,396
All right.,S03E02,397
Voila.,S03E02,398
There's nothing here. What's going on?,S03E02,399
I'll tell you what's going on.,S03E02,400
I did a little research on Graystone academy.,S03E02,401
There is no Colonel Klink.,S03E02,402
That's because he was replaced by Captain Kirk.,S03E02,403
"Come on, guys.",S03E02,404
You were just messing with me.,S03E02,405
You were never gonna send me to military school.,S03E02,406
"No, we weren't,",S03E02,407
But we could.,S03E02,408
"No, you can't.",S03E02,409
"No matter how much trouble I get into,",S03E02,410
You guys love me too much.,S03E02,411
I'd love you a little more.,S03E02,412
If you made me a breakfast bob-urrito.,S03E02,413
And a bowl of oatmeal with those yummy blueberries.,S03E02,414
"All right, coming right up.",S03E02,415
"Oh, but first",S03E02,416
I'm gonna need you guys to sign this.,S03E02,417
"Well, Charlie, Gabe's not going to militarschool,",S03E02,418
"And I'm no longer considered a jinx,",S03E02,419
So everything's looking good here.,S03E02,420
"Hey, Charlie.",S03E02,421
"Well, almost everything.",S03E02,422
What happened?,S03E02,423
"Jerry, my barber, is what happened.",S03E02,424
-It looks painful.,S03E02,425
-You should see my legs.,S03E02,426
"And you're related to him,",S03E02,427
"So good luck, Charlie.",S03E02,428
Where have you been? The game's almost over.,S03E02,429
I was on a date.,S03E02,430
"Oh, with who?",S03E02,431
Serge Lefleur.,S03E02,432
"You know he's imaginary, right?",S03E02,433
"Uh, don't listen to her, baby.",S03E02,434
What did I tell you about that unicycle?,S03E02,435
Take it outside.,S03E02,436
"You got here just in time. If Spencer makes this shot,",S03E02,437
We win the state championship.,S03E02,438
Oh!,S03E02,439
Not in my house.,S03E02,440
"Man, this is so great, getting to hang out with you.",S03E03,0
I forgot how cool you are.,S03E03,1
Aww.,S03E03,2
"Ivy, you are so sweet.",S03E03,3
I love hanging out with you too.,S03E03,4
Shh! I'm on video chat.,S03E03,5
"Oh! Hey, Ivy, did you see this email from our guidance counselor?",S03E03,6
Mm-mm.,S03E03,7
"If it's from school, it goes straight to my spam.",S03E03,8
"Well, this is about our community service requirement.",S03E03,9
"If we don't get this done, we don't graduate next year.",S03E03,10
See? This is why I don't open emails from school.,S03E03,11
They always stress me out.,S03E03,12
"Oh no, it gets worse.",S03E03,13
"See, because we waited so long,",S03E03,14
There are only two jobs left.,S03E03,15
The first one includes helping old people,S03E03,16
-Pass.,S03E03,17
-But you didn't let me finish.,S03E03,18
You lost me at old people.,S03E03,19
so what's the other one?,S03E03,20
"Interning at k-qui,",S03E03,21
-That public radio station. -You mean the one where,S03E03,22
Everyone talks like this.,S03E03,23
Yes.,S03E03,24
"Yes, that's the one.",S03E03,25
"Man, I hate that station.",S03E03,26
"Well, would you rather bathe old people?",S03E03,27
And we're on the air.,S03E03,28
Today's all burnt toast ,S03E03,29
"Running late, and dad jokes",S03E03,30
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S03E03,31
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S03E03,32
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S03E03,33
There it is up on the roof,S03E03,34
"I've been there, I've survived",S03E03,35
So just take my advice,S03E03,36
"Hang in there, baby",S03E03,37
Things are crazy,S03E03,38
But I know your future's bright,S03E03,39
"Hang in there, baby",S03E03,40
There's no maybe,S03E03,41
Everything turns out all right,S03E03,42
Your life is up and down,S03E03,43
But trust me it comes back around,S03E03,44
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S03E03,45
"Hang in there, baby.",S03E03,46
"Hey, Bob, honey, I have a great idea.",S03E03,47
-We should have a baby -No!,S03E03,48
No more babies!,S03E03,49
Would you let me finish?,S03E03,50
I was going to say we should have a baby shower.,S03E03,51
Oh.,S03E03,52
You should really run your words together a little faster.,S03E03,53
Is a baby shower even appropriate for a fifth kid?,S03E03,54
It is when you gave away all your other baby stuff.,S03E03,55
Because you were absolutely certain.,S03E03,56
You weren't gonna have another one.,S03E03,57
What are you looking at me for?,S03E03,58
What are you looking at me for?,S03E03,59
So,S03E03,60
"Throwing yourself a baby shower, huh?",S03E03,61
I am not throwing myself a baby shower.,S03E03,62
That's tacky.,S03E03,63
I just need.,S03E03,64
To trick someone into throwing it for me.,S03E03,65
But who?,S03E03,66
"Oh, don't worry.",S03E03,67
I'll get it.,S03E03,68
-Hi.,S03E03,69
-Mary Lou Wentz.,S03E03,70
Come on in.,S03E03,71
"Thank you, Amy.",S03E03,72
I was just talking to Bob about you.,S03E03,73
-Really? -I was just telling him.,S03E03,74
How you're my very best friend.,S03E03,75
Oh.,S03E03,76
And you're,S03E03,77
I'm just here to pick up Ivy.,S03E03,78
"Mary Lou, what's the rush?",S03E03,79
Have a seat.,S03E03,80
Take a load off.,S03E03,81
"Oh, I think I'm just gonna leave you two alone.",S03E03,82
So what's my best friend up to?,S03E03,83
That would be you.,S03E03,84
"Oh, right right.",S03E03,85
"Well, not much.",S03E03,86
Great great.,S03E03,87
"Well, you know, if you want something to do,",S03E03,88
You could throw a baby shower for your best friend.,S03E03,89
That would be me.,S03E03,90
Oh. A baby shower?,S03E03,91
"Yes, doesn't it sound fun?",S03E03,92
"Okay, I will do all the work.",S03E03,93
All you have to do is show up and host it.,S03E03,94
"Okay, I guess I could do that.",S03E03,95
Great.,S03E03,96
"Oh, and I want it to be a surprise.",S03E03,97
But you already know about it.,S03E03,98

"Teddy, would you like to go to the prom with me?",S03E04,15
-No.,S03E04,16
-Wait.,S03E04,17
What?.,S03E04,18
"Well, first you make a whole big deal out of the invitation,",S03E04,19
Then you just blurt it out?,S03E04,20
"Where's the romance, the heart?",S03E04,21
Maybe I should start over.,S03E04,22
"Yeah, I think that would be best.",S03E04,23
"-Teddy, would you like to go to the -No, no, no, no.",S03E04,24

of allowing me to escort you to the prom?,S03E04,32
"Oh, you're tearing up.",S03E04,33
"Oh, my gosh.",S03E04,34
"Of course I'll go with you, baby.",S03E04,35
"-Got stuck by a thorn, didn't you? -Uh-huh.",S03E04,36
Today's all burnt toast ,S03E04,37
"Running late, and dad jokes",S03E04,38
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S03E04,39
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S03E04,40
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S03E04,41
There it is up on the roof,S03E04,42
"I've been there, I've survived",S03E04,43
So just take my advice,S03E04,44
"Hang in there, baby",S03E04,45
Things are crazy,S03E04,46
But I know your future's bright,S03E04,47
"Hang in there, baby",S03E04,48
There's no maybe,S03E04,49
Everything turns out all right,S03E04,50
Your life is up and down,S03E04,51
But trust me it comes back around,S03E04,52
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S03E04,53
"Hang in there, baby.",S03E04,54
What are you guys doing?,S03E04,55
"I'm looking through my yearbook, trying to find a prom date.",S03E04,56
"Yeah, and I'm watching him so I can see what mistakes",S03E04,57
to avoid when I'm in High School.,S03E04,58
P.,S03E04,59
J.,S03E04,60
", prom's this Saturday.",S03E04,61
You might wanna hurry up.,S03E04,62
"Oh, it's okay.",S03E04,63
I've seen his report card.,S03E04,64
He'll probably have two more senior proms.,S03E04,65
"Hey, what do you know about Cynthia Markowski?",S03E04,66
She was in the gifted program and graduated early.,S03E04,67
Stupid smart people.,S03E04,68
"Hey, what about Robin Rogers?",S03E04,69
-She's pretty cute.,S03E04,70
-That's a guy.,S03E04,71
Who was your date last year?,S03E04,72
I went with a group.,S03E04,73
So now we're calling Emmett a group?,S03E04,74
There's gotta be somebody out there for me.,S03E04,75
I just Hope I find her in time.,S03E04,76

J.,S03E04,83
May have just found his prom date.,S03E04,84
Can I ask you something?,S03E04,85
"Sure, anything.",S03E04,86
Do you guys have any wacky bread?,S03E04,87
"Yeah, it's gonna take a little more than luck.",S03E04,88
Get over there.,S03E04,89
"Well, things look good. The baby's doing great,",S03E04,90
but I'm a little concerned about the weight gain.,S03E04,91
I really haven't gained that much.,S03E04,92
"No, I mean him.",S03E04,93
"Just kidding. We like to have fun here, right, Marcia?",S03E04,94
So would you like a DVD of your ultrasound?,S03E04,95
-Yes.,S03E04,96
-No.,S03E04,97
I thought we agreed we wanted to wait to find out if it's a boy or a girl.,S03E04,98
We want to be surprised.,S03E04,99
I don't like surprises.,S03E04,100
I want to know.,S03E04,101
And the person carrying the baby,S03E04,102
Thinks it's better not to know.,S03E04,103
We'd like to be surprised.,S03E04,104
"Put this in the Duncan file, please.",S03E04,105
That's okay.,S03E04,106
We don't need to know.,S03E04,107
"As long as our baby boy is healthy, right, doc?",S03E04,108
"I mean, the main thing is that our baby girl",S03E04,109
"is doing great, right, doc?",S03E04,110
"Bob, honey, the man's not an idiot.",S03E04,111
"He has a medical degree. Right, doc?",S03E04,112
Thanks.,S03E04,113
That was a really fun first date.,S03E04,114
"Taylor, in my experience,",S03E04,115
you can never go wrong with mini golf.,S03E04,116
P.,S03E04,117
J.,S03E04,118
", I know we just met,.",S03E04,119
but can I ask you something?,S03E04,120
"Okay, but nothing too hard, cause this date's going really well.",S03E04,121
"My senior prom is this Saturday,",S03E04,122
and I was wondering if you would like to go with me.,S03E04,123
-Uh-oh. -Too hard?,S03E04,124
"No, no, no, no, no.",S03E04,125
It's just my senior prom is also this Saturday.,S03E04,126
"I was really excited about it,",S03E04,127
and I was gonna ask you.,S03E04,128
Oh.,S03E04,129
"But you asked me first, so yes.",S03E04,130
"Oh, and just so you know, I would have said yes.",S03E04,131
Yes!,S03E04,132
-Then it's a date? -Absolutely.,S03E04,133
"Wait, whose prom are we going to?",S03E04,134
"Mine, I think.",S03E04,135
"-Yeah, yeah.",S03E04,136
-Yeah.,S03E04,137
"And after the baby's born,",S03E04,138
mommy and daddy will bring it home from the hospital.,S03E04,139
But when do they take it back?,S03E04,140
"Charlie, they don't take the babies back.",S03E04,141
I know.,S03E04,142
I tried with Gabe.,S03E04,143
"Teddy, there you are.",S03E04,144
"Hey, listen, I was wondering if you've picked out a prom dress yet.",S03E04,145
"No, I really need to go shopping.",S03E04,146
Or not.,S03E04,147
"Mom, I need to buy a dress.",S03E04,148
I can't just wear something from my closet.,S03E04,149
Maybe not your closet.,S03E04,150
I don't like where this is going.,S03E04,151
Let me tell you a story,S03E04,152
"that seemed tragic at the time,",S03E04,153
but is now finally gonna have a happy ending.,S03E04,154
I really don't like where this is going.,S03E04,155
"The year was 1988,",S03E04,156
and a young and beautiful Amy blankenhooper,S03E04,157
was on her way to the prom with her third choice Bob Duncan.,S03E04,158
"But alas, all would not turn out as Amy had planned.",S03E04,159
"Knowing this story would go on for a while,",S03E04,160
Teddy sat down.,S03E04,161
"Bob Diddlebock, Amy's first choice,",S03E04,162
took his date out for steak.,S03E04,163
Bob Duncan had a coupon for the shrimp Bucket.,S03E04,164
"Anyway, it was an all-you-can-eat night,",S03E04,165
"and Amy tried to keep up with Bob,",S03E04,166
which was her second mistake.,S03E04,167
A mistake that her beautiful prom dress,S03E04,168
would pay for dearly.,S03E04,169
So what are you saying,S03E04,170
Did you puke on your prom dress?,S03E04,171
"Well, in 1988, we called it hurling.",S03E04,172
Now this sad little story is finally gonna have a happy ending.,S03E04,173
"Teddy, don't you see?",S03E04,174
I saved that prom dress all these years,S03E04,175
so that you could wear it to your prom.,S03E04,176
I'll go get it.,S03E04,177
"Mom, you really don't have to",S03E04,178
Ba-bam!,S03E04,179
"Teddy, when this dress goes to the prom,",S03E04,180
it'll almost be like I finally get to go to the prom.,S03E04,181
I wish it were you.,S03E04,182
"And, Charlie,",S03E04,183
"maybe you can wear this to your prom, too.",S03E04,184
"No, thank you, mommy.",S03E04,185
"Okay. Whatcha doing, dad?",S03E04,186
"Oh, just thinking about the new baby.",S03E04,187
"Yeah, I like to do my thinking upstairs,",S03E04,188
"just in case someone wants to come down here,",S03E04,189
play some video games or something.,S03E04,190
"You know, all I want to know",S03E04,191
is if it's gonna be a boy or a girl.,S03E04,192
But your mother wants to be surprised.,S03E04,193
Why don't you find out and then not tell mom?,S03E04,194
"You have a brain of your own, right?",S03E04,195
Of course I do.,S03E04,196
It's just that your mother's brain doesn't like it,S03E04,197
when my brain goes off on its own.,S03E04,198
"Dad, you can't just do whatever mom tells you to do.",S03E04,199
You have to stand up for yourself.,S03E04,200
"You know, you have to call the doctor and you have to demand to know.",S03E04,201
-You know what? You're right. -Right?,S03E04,202
"-I mean, I am the baby's father.",S03E04,203
"-Yes, you are.",S03E04,204
"Yes, I do have some rights.",S03E04,205
Hello.,S03E04,206
"Marcia, Bob Duncan.",S03E04,207
I don't wanna bother the doctor. I was just could you,S03E04,208
"For me, could you just take a little look-see in our file",S03E04,209
and just tell me if we're gonna have a boy or a girl?,S03E04,210
"Okay, sure.",S03E04,211
"All right, what did she say?",S03E04,212
Would I please hold while she calls your mother?,S03E04,213
"Well, face it, dad.",S03E04,214
Your brain's no match for mom's.,S03E04,215
"But lucky for you, I have a plan.",S03E04,216
Is it an evil plan?,S03E04,217
"No, no, no.",S03E04,218
It's a plan that helps the poor.,S03E04,219
"Of course, it's an evil plan.",S03E04,220
I don't know.,S03E04,221
"Oh, come on.",S03E04,222
You know you want to do it.,S03E04,223
Isn't that why you came to me in the first place?,S03E04,224
Yeah.,S03E04,225
-Wow! You look great.,S03E04,226
-So do you.,S03E04,227
-Come on in.,S03E04,228
-Okay.,S03E04,229
Here we are.,S03E04,230
-What is this? -It's the prom.,S03E04,231
Your prom is here in your house?,S03E04,232
"Yeah, I'm homeschooled.",S03E04,233
So this is the whole prom?,S03E04,234
Just you and me,S03E04,235
and some old lady?,S03E04,236
"Oh, that's my grandma.",S03E04,237
She's also the dj.,S03E04,238
Why's she wearing a sombrero?,S03E04,239
Because the theme of the prom,S03E04,240
is south of the border.,S03E04,241
"Oh, okay, that makes sense.",S03E04,242
"For a second there, I thought it was weird.",S03E04,243
"Hola, kids!",S03E04,244
Let the fiesta begin. Ole!,S03E04,245
P.,S03E04,246
J.,S03E04,247
", this is my mom.",S03E04,248
-Hi.,S03E04,249
-Hi.,S03E04,250
And my biology teacher and my history teacher,S03E04,251
-and my math teacher.,S03E04,252
"-All right, picture time.",S03E04,253
Now smile.,S03E04,254
It's for the yearbook.,S03E04,255
I know this is a little unusual.,S03E04,256
I guess I should have told you I was homeschooled.,S03E04,257
But it had been good information to have,S03E04,258
"Oh, excuse me.",S03E04,259
"Well, at least it's not getting any weirder.",S03E04,260
Hi yee!,S03E04,261
So what do you think?,S03E04,262
"I, uh",S03E04,263
Uh,S03E04,264
"No, relax, I've got a different dress hidden in the bushes.",S03E04,265
"Well, then why are you wearing that one?",S03E04,266
"Teddy, you almost look as beautiful",S03E04,267
in that dress as I did.,S03E04,268
Never mind.,S03E04,269
"Okay, picture time.",S03E04,270
"Okay, back it up.",S03E04,271
You're crushing the ruffles.,S03E04,272
Good one.,S03E04,273
"Okay, over here.",S03E04,274
Over here.,S03E04,275
Over here.,S03E04,276
"Chin down, Spencer.",S03E04,277
"Okay, mom, come on, we have to go.",S03E04,278
"Okay, have fun.",S03E04,279
"Oh, wait! Wait.",S03E04,280
I almost forgot.,S03E04,281
I have a surprise.,S03E04,282
The matching hat!,S03E04,283
Oh!,S03E04,284
"Oh, now my head can be as lucky as the rest of me.",S03E04,285
"-Hey, excuse me, are you Dr.",S03E04,286
Karp? -Yes.,S03E04,287
"Hi, I'm Gabe Duncan.",S03E04,288
-Oh! -Nice to meet you.,S03E04,289
And this is Charlie.,S03E04,290
"You know, we're here because she's having a hard time",S03E04,291
with the new baby thing.,S03E04,292
"Hey, Charlie,",S03E04,293
here's the man who can make you happy again.,S03E04,294
Talk to him.,S03E04,295
Will I have a little sister or little brother?,S03E04,296
"Awww, did you hear that?",S03E04,297
"She said, a wittle sisto or wittle brudder.",S03E04,298
Who can say no to that?,S03E04,299
I could.,S03E04,300
What kind of doctor would I be if I told you without your parents' permission?,S03E04,301
"A doctor who's got a little extra walking around money,",S03E04,302
if you know what I'm saying.,S03E04,303
It's not gonna happen.,S03E04,304
I'll be in the exam room.,S03E04,305
"Gabe, get the DVD.",S03E04,306
It's in the file.,S03E04,307
Okay.,S03E04,308
Hey.,S03E04,309
"Hey, Charlie, if you go find the doctor,",S03E04,310
"I'll give you some candy, okay?",S03E04,311
-Okay.,S03E04,312
"-Okay, come on.",S03E04,313
Find him.,S03E04,314
"Oh, no!",S03E04,315
My wittle sisto has run into the exam room!,S03E04,316
She can't go in there.,S03E04,317
"Daley, Davis.",S03E04,318
"Oh, duncan.",S03E04,319

J.,S03E04,334
"Well, here's my prom night.",S03E04,335
Turns out taylor is homeschooled.,S03E04,336
So what was supposed to be the greatest night of my life,S03E04,337
is now the strangest.,S03E04,338
But I guess I shouldn't complain.,S03E04,339
I was voted prom King.,S03E04,340
Poor P.,S03E04,341
J.,S03E04,342
It's his senior prom and he's miserable.,S03E04,343
"Yeah, that's a shame.",S03E04,344
"Okay, let's go in.",S03E04,345
"Dr. Karp, have you seen the Duncan DVD?",S03E04,346
-I can't find it. -Amy Duncan?,S03E04,347
"No, Angela Duncan.",S03E04,348
The one who's having triplets.,S03E04,349
"Awww, man, I'm never getting my own room.",S03E04,350
"Hey, look out, everyone.",S03E04,351
This prom's officially been crashed!,S03E04,352
"-Yeah, all right! -Yeah, uh-huh!",S03E04,353
What are you guys doing here?,S03E04,354
We got your text,S03E04,355

-Right.,S03E04,357
-That we just had to come.,S03E04,358
"Yeah, what a relief to be away from all those noisy people,",S03E04,359
laughing and having fun.,S03E04,360
This is so much better.,S03E04,361
"Teddy, you gave up your prom for me?",S03E04,362
"Oh, please.",S03E04,363
Going to prom at regular school is so last year.,S03E04,364
Thank you.,S03E04,365
"Hello, P.",S03E04,366
J.,S03E04,367

What's mom doing here?,S03E04,369
Did you send that text to everybody?,S03E04,370
"Yeah, it was an accident.",S03E04,371
Grandma was getting kinda handsy during the slow dance.,S03E04,372
She can't see me in this dress. Is there another way out of here?,S03E04,373
-There's a door around the back.,S03E04,374
"-Okay, I'm gonna go change.",S03E04,375
-Cover for me. -Wait,S03E04,376
"-hi, everyone. -Hey, hey!",S03E04,377
"Mom, dad, what are you guys doing here?",S03E04,378

"Aww, you guys are the best.",S03E04,381
"-Hey, there. -Hey, Spencer,",S03E04,382
-what are you doing here? Where's Teddy? -I don't know.,S03E04,383
"She'll be back in, like, three minutes.",S03E04,384
"-Yeah, speaking of three, honey, we really need to talk. -I'm back!",S03E04,385
I'm back.,S03E04,386
Hi.,S03E04,387
Why is your dress on backwards?,S03E04,388
"Okay, all right, mom, the truth is",S03E04,389
the reason why I didn't wanna wear this dress,S03E04,390
is because I I just don't like it.,S03E04,391
What's not to like?,S03E04,392
On on me.,S03E04,393
"See, the problem with such",S03E04,394
a beautiful dress,S03E04,395
is that it only works on you.,S03E04,396
"No one can do justice to this dress like you, mom.",S03E04,397
"Teddy, Teddy, Teddy, Teddy.",S03E04,398
"Honey, if you are suggesting",S03E04,399
that I put that dress and this hat on,S03E04,400
"because we are at a prom at this very moment,",S03E04,401
"well, the answer would be a resounding okay.",S03E04,402
Let's go change.,S03E04,403
Okay.,S03E04,404
You don't mind being here?,S03E04,405
"As long as I'm with you, I don't care where we are.",S03E04,406
Awww.,S03E04,407
"Hey, take a seat, grandma.",S03E04,408
It's not gonna happen.,S03E04,409
"I Hope I get to see you again,",S03E04,410
"but I don't know, I'm off to college soon.",S03E04,411
-Where you going? -The rec room.,S03E04,412
"Honey, this probably isn't what you were expecting",S03E04,413
"to hear at your prom, but you remember the ultrasound",S03E04,414
-we decided not to look at? -Yes.,S03E04,415
-I looked.,S03E04,416

"Honey, we're having triplets.",S03E04,420

Today's all burnt toast,S03E05,14
Running late and dad jokes,S03E05,15
Has anybody seen my left shoe?,S03E05,16
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S03E05,17

"No, I need it for bait.",S03E05,37
"Believe it or not, we got a giant snake loose in Sloan's Lake.",S03E05,38
Look at that an anaconda.,S03E05,39
What? How could an anaconda get to Denver?,S03E05,40
-Who knows? -Maybe some kid went to Florida,S03E05,41
"On vacation with his grandparents,",S03E05,42
Brought a baby snake back.,S03E05,43
Maybe the kid named him snappy.,S03E05,44
"Maybe when snappy got too big, the kid freaked out.",S03E05,45
And set him free.,S03E05,46
Just a guess.,S03E05,47
"Anyway, this is the opportunity of a lifetime.",S03E05,48
"I mean, if I can catch this snake,",S03E05,49
This is great publicity for the triple-b-g.,S03E05,50

Bob's bugs be gone.,S03E05,52
-Oh oh! -Oh okay.,S03E05,53

I'd love to see you get chased by a giant snake.,S03E05,55

"-So about tonight -No, shh!",S03E05,62
"Okay, coast is clear.",S03E05,63
Do we really have to be so secretive?,S03E05,64
Are you kidding?,S03E05,65
Do you have any idea what would happen if my mom found out?,S03E05,66
"So when I pick you up tonight, what do we say we're doing?",S03E05,67
Don't worry.,S03E05,68
I'll come up with something.,S03E05,69

I've got a dangerous mission for you.,S03E05,84
"Mitch, I am not trying the chocolate shake again.",S03E05,85
I need you to find out who is stealing chicken from the store.,S03E05,86
Why would someone steal our chicken? Haven't they tasted it?,S03E05,87
"I don't know, but",S03E05,88
Corporate is really busting my giblets about this.,S03E05,89
So I am putting my best man on it.,S03E05,90
-You. -Oh!,S03E05,91
Cool. Any idea who the thief is?,S03E05,92
"Okay, I'm pretty sure it's an inside job. So it could be Justin",S03E05,93
"Okay, your meal was $3. And you gave me a $5, so",S03E05,94
Don't help me.,S03E05,95
I got this.,S03E05,96
"Then there's Val, the vegetarian",S03E05,97
Here's your murdered chicken.,S03E05,98
"And finally, big Lenny.",S03E05,99
You gonna finish that?,S03E05,100
"So what do you think, kid? Who's the master chicken thief?",S03E05,101
Gut instinct? I gotta go with Justin.,S03E05,102
"Three from five Or was it five from three? Think, Justin.",S03E05,103
Think.,S03E05,104
Or Val.,S03E05,105
Could be Val.,S03E05,106
"So once the snake takes the meat, then I slip that over his neck.",S03E05,107
"And then once I got him, I turn to your camera and I say,",S03E05,108
"take a break, snake!",S03E05,109
Ha.,S03E05,110
"Dad, I wouldn't overthink the once-I've-got-him part.",S03E05,111
"You know what? I still need a catchphrase,",S03E05,112
Something Tom cruise can say when he plays me in the movie.,S03E05,113
"How about, boy, have I been miscast?",S03E05,114
"Uh, Gabe, I don't believe you've met",S03E05,115
Denver's least-favorite animal-control officer.,S03E05,116
"Hello, quint",S03E05,117
"What are you doing here, bug boy?",S03E05,118
"There's a monster snake on the loose, not a termite.",S03E05,119
Yeah. Shouldn't you be getting some old lady's Kitty out of a tree?,S03E05,120
Hmm? Muffin can wait.,S03E05,121
"First, I'm bringing in that cold-blooded beast out there.",S03E05,122
Have you ever caught anything like this before?,S03E05,123
Does this answer your question?,S03E05,124
That's a t-shirt.,S03E05,125
"I'm here to catch a snake, not a cold.",S03E05,126
See that scar? I got that tangling with a great white.,S03E05,127
-Shark? -Labradoodle.,S03E05,128
Those things are fierce.,S03E05,129
"Face it, Duncan, you're out of your league.",S03E05,130
You're an exterminator!,S03E05,131
"What are you going to do, tent the Lake?",S03E05,132
"Uh, no.",S03E05,133
I'm gonna catch him with this.,S03E05,134

", what are you doing?.",S03E05,172
I'm going undercover to figure out,S03E05,173
Which one of my co-workers is stealing chicken.,S03E05,174
And you think they're going to open up when they see Gandalf?,S03E05,175
You got a better idea?,S03E05,176
"-Yeah, wear a wire.",S03E05,177
-Yes! I love it.,S03E05,178
What's a wire?,S03E05,179
A recording device.,S03E05,180
You wear it under your clothes.,S03E05,181
And then you can use what the people say against them.,S03E05,182
-Cool.,S03E05,183
I'll wear a wire.,S03E05,184
-Yeah.,S03E05,185
I'll be like a spy.,S03E05,186
A spy from middle earth.,S03E05,187
And I'll be like your brother.,S03E05,188
From planet earth.,S03E05,189
"Oh, movie my butt.",S03E05,190
Party time's over.,S03E05,191
You're doing a show Without me!?,S03E05,192
So this is what you've been doing? Rehearsing a musical behind my back?,S03E05,193
"Teddy, when did you stop loving me?",S03E05,194
"Mom, I was hoping you wouldn't find out this way.",S03E05,195
"Actually, I was just hoping you wouldn't find out.",S03E05,196
And you're doing franny saves the farm?,S03E05,197
That's my favorite musical of all time.,S03E05,198
"Not only that, she's playing franny.",S03E05,199
"Don't help me, Franklin.",S03E05,200
"Hey, let's let's take a five, everybody.",S03E05,201
"Oh, Teddy, why would you keep this from me?",S03E05,202
"I could have helped you, taught you, mentored you.",S03E05,203
"Yeah, and those are three of the reasons I didn't tell you.",S03E05,204
What are you trying to say?,S03E05,205
"Mom, anytime I try to do something.",S03E05,206
"That has to do with performing, you get involved.",S03E05,207
And you don't just get involved; you take over.,S03E05,208
"Well, I'm sorry, Teddy.",S03E05,209
Okay? I love the spotlight.,S03E05,210
"But in fairness, not as much as the spotlight loves me.",S03E05,211
"Mom, I would like for you to not make this about you, just this one time.",S03E05,212
"Please, could you just be my mom?",S03E05,213
"Moms bring flowers, they sit in the audience and they watch their kids.",S03E05,214
"-Well, I -Quietly.",S03E05,215
Well I'm sorry I've been such a terrible mother.,S03E05,216
"No no, mom, I didn't",S03E05,217
I told you the spotlight loved me.,S03E05,218
"Clark, cut it out.",S03E05,219
14 miles per hour,S03E05,220
"Well, time to get some sleep, Gabe.",S03E05,221
Got a snake to catch tomorrow.,S03E05,222
"Hey, dad, have you ever knocked out a grizzly bear with one punch?",S03E05,223
"Well, let me think.",S03E05,224
"Uh, no.",S03E05,225
You know who has? Quint.,S03E05,226
How do you know that?,S03E05,227
I'm reading this blog.,S03E05,228
It's called quint while you're ahead.,S03E05,229
"-Man, is he tough!  -Hey, I'm just as tough as quint.",S03E05,230
"I don't know, dad.",S03E05,231
Maybe you should leave the snake catching to him.,S03E05,232
"I mean, you're an exterminator.",S03E05,233
You set off bug bombs and run.,S03E05,234
"I have to run, Gabe.",S03E05,235
It's government mandated.,S03E05,236
Time to catch a chicken thief.,S03E05,237
"So glad you all could come over,",S03E05,238
"Justin, Val and big Lenny.",S03E05,239
"And we're away from work,",S03E05,240
So we can really let our hair down.,S03E05,241
I let my hair down at work all the time.,S03E05,242
I lost a scrunchie in the Cole slaw once.,S03E05,243
"Come on, guys, this is our chance to bond,",S03E05,244
"Share our hopes, our dreams,",S03E05,245
Our darkest secrets.,S03E05,246
Who wants to go first? Lenny?,S03E05,247
I'm hungry.,S03E05,248
Good start.,S03E05,249
"Not a secret, but good start.",S03E05,250
"If we're telling secrets, why don't you go first?",S03E05,251
Okay.,S03E05,252
Okay.,S03E05,253
"Uh, sometimes I steal supplies from work. Anybody want to piggyback on that?",S03E05,254
-I took a straw once.,S03E05,255
-Yeah yeah.,S03E05,256
"But I felt so bad, I brought back two.",S03E05,257
-Ahem. Ah -What was that?,S03E05,258
-What was what? -Sounded like feedback.,S03E05,259
I didn't hear anything.,S03E05,260
"Mom, what are you doing here?",S03E05,261
"Well, it is children's theater.",S03E05,262
I thought Charlie might like it.,S03E05,263
And she has something for you.,S03E05,264
"Aw, Charlie, thank you.",S03E05,265
"Okay, come on, sweetie, let's go.",S03E05,266
"Oh, mom, wait. Um",S03E05,267
"About what I said yesterday, I was out of line.",S03E05,268
And?,S03E05,269
And I'm really sorry.,S03E05,270
And?,S03E05,271
That's all I got.,S03E05,272
Okay.,S03E05,273
"Well, you may not have been entirely wrong.",S03E05,274
It might be possible that I have a small problem with the spotlight.,S03E05,275
"Mom, we're backstage.",S03E05,276
The lights are out front.,S03E05,277
That's what I hate about backstage.,S03E05,278
"Anyway, this is your moment to shine.",S03E05,279
"So as we say in the theater,",S03E05,280
-Break a leg.,S03E05,281
-Oh.,S03E05,282
Terrible news Franklin just broke his leg.,S03E05,283
"-He can't do the show. -Well, what are we going to do?",S03E05,284
"I've got to find somebody to play banker Jones, somebody who knows the part.",S03E05,285
"Okay, I swear I had nothing to do with this.",S03E05,286
"Yeah, good day to catch a snake.",S03E05,287
You're right! It was.,S03E05,288
"I caught him an hour ago, took him to the zoo.",S03E05,289
You did?,S03E05,290
"-Well, then what are you doing here?  -Came back to do this. Nnnngg!",S03E05,291
"Aw, man, was that quint?",S03E05,292
Great.,S03E05,293
So I missed the coolest guy in the world.,S03E05,294
Because I had to get your potato chips.,S03E05,295
"Hey, the point is, did you get em?",S03E05,296
So did quint see the snake?,S03E05,297
"Yeah, matter of fact, he did. And then he",S03E05,298
And then he left Because he was afraid.,S03E05,299
Quint's afraid?  -Yeah. Can you believe that?,S03E05,300
Coolest guy in the world leaves because he's afraid.,S03E05,301
But you know who isn't afraid? Your old man.,S03E05,302
And I am putting an end to this once and for all.,S03E05,303
"All right. Come and get it, snappy!",S03E05,304
"Dad, are you sure about this?",S03E05,305
"Hey, a man's got to do what a man's got Oh man! This water is cold.",S03E05,306
What's he doing out there?,S03E05,307
-Catching the snake. -What?,S03E05,308
"-Duncan, I was lying! -What?",S03E05,309
"-I didn't catch the snake! -Yes, I am in the Lake!",S03E05,310
"-Dad, come back.",S03E05,311
-I was just trying to get rid of you.,S03E05,312
-What? -Whoa. Is that a log floating towards him or,S03E05,313
Sna-a-a-ake!,S03E05,314
Snake in the Lake!,S03E05,315
"Get the truck, get the truck, get the truck, get the truck! Get the truck!",S03E05,316
"Like father, like son.",S03E05,317
A couple of scaredy cats running from a stupid log.,S03E05,318
Uh-oh.,S03E05,319
So that's it? You learned nothing?,S03E05,320
I learned big Lenny combs his beard with a fork.,S03E05,321
So we'll never find out who's stealing the chicken.,S03E05,322
Corporate is going to be devastated.,S03E05,323
This is going to haunt me forever.,S03E05,324
"-Oh well! -You know, funny thing though.",S03E05,325
"After the party, I came back here to look at our security-camera footage.",S03E05,326
"We, uh, have security cameras?",S03E05,327
Yeah.,S03E05,328
"Yeah, and it showed this guy who looks just like you.",S03E05,329
Taking boxes of chicken out of the storage fridge.,S03E05,330
Do you by chance have an evil twin brother?,S03E05,331
I don't recall.,S03E05,332
Then your brother put the stolen chicken in his car.,S03E05,333
-You got that on tape? -Uh-huh.,S03E05,334
And here's the crazy part,S03E05,335
Your brother drives the exact same car that you do.,S03E05,336
I guess that makes sense though.,S03E05,337
"I mean, you are twins.",S03E05,338
All right!,S03E05,339
Quit toying with me.,S03E05,340
I confess.,S03E05,341
I stole the chicken.,S03E05,342
"So I could open my own place,",S03E05,343
mitch's discount poultry hut.,S03E05,344
Wait. So you don't have a twin brother?,S03E05,345
"Stop it, kid. You got me, all right?",S03E05,346
Okay.,S03E05,347
"Well, I'm confused.",S03E05,348
"If you were the one stealing the chicken,.",S03E05,349
Why did you ask me to catch a chicken thief?,S03E05,350
"I mean, I'm your best man, right?",S03E05,351
I never thought someone so stupid could catch me.,S03E05,352
"Well, look who's stupid now.",S03E05,353

Hey hey! I was not chicken.,S03E05,369
I was exiting the Lake in a rapid fashion.,S03E05,370
"No, dad, it's all right.",S03E05,371
I'd rather have a live coward than a dead hero.,S03E05,372
"Oh, thank you, son.",S03E05,373
"Yeah. Live hero would have been the best, but",S03E05,374
"Of course. I mean, if you're going to rank them,",S03E05,375
"You'd want your live hero, live coward.",S03E05,376

"Hang in there, baby.",S03E06,55
"-Hey, honey, how is your school? -Not now.",S03E06,56
"Teddy, you okay?",S03E06,57
I don't have time for all these questions.,S03E06,58
I have a huge european history final tomorrow.,S03E06,59
"-Okay, take it easy. -Easy?",S03E06,60
It's worth half of my grade.,S03E06,61
"Plus it's second semester, junior year,",S03E06,62
So these are the most important grades for college.,S03E06,63
"If I don't get into college, I won't have a good career.",S03E06,64
Or a nice family or a happy life!,S03E06,65
"Everything's on the line here, people.",S03E06,66
Wow.,S03E06,67

Duncan.,S03E06,77
"Well, they were all wrong.",S03E06,78
I can't believe my baby's gonna graduate.,S03E06,79

Wait wait wait. What do you mean?,S03E06,81

E.,S03E06,83
That means I'm not gonna get my diploma.,S03E06,84
"Wait, I'm graduating and you're not?",S03E06,85
This is like the exact opposite of kindergarten.,S03E06,86
"My parents are gonna be crushed, man.",S03E06,87
This is a disaster.,S03E06,88
"Dude, you can't give up. Just talk to your teacher,",S03E06,89
Work something out. Who is it?,S03E06,90
Mr.,S03E06,91

"Okay, Charlie, now when the new baby comes home,",S03E06,105
"Mommy and daddy, we're gonna have to spend a lot of time with him or her,",S03E06,106
But that doesn't mean that we love you any less.,S03E06,107
That's right.,S03E06,108
We love all of our babies the same.,S03E06,109
And every one of you has been a baby.,S03E06,110

"When dad plays peek-a-boo with me, he doesn't actually disappear?",S03E06,117
"-No, he's just behind his hands. -Are you sure?",S03E06,118
Do we have to have this conversation every day?,S03E06,119
-I'm hungry.,S03E06,120

But Gabe keeps yelling.,S03E06,151
"Sweetie, if you need a quiet place to study, why don't you just do it here?",S03E06,152
I'm just doing my yoga.,S03E06,153
I'll put on my headphones.,S03E06,154
Won't bother you at all.,S03E06,155
"-Thanks, mom.",S03E06,156
-Mm-hmm.,S03E06,157
What are you doing?,S03E06,158
The breath of fire.,S03E06,159
"Well, could you extinguish it?",S03E06,160
I just lit it.,S03E06,161
I'll study in the kitchen.,S03E06,162

"-Hi, dad.",S03E06,164
"-Hey, sweetie.",S03E06,165
"Dad, how long do you think that's gonna take?",S03E06,166
Do you want it fast or you want it yummy?,S03E06,167
So mom and dad were giving you.,S03E06,168
"The old new baby pep talk, huh?",S03E06,169
"Well, forget it, Charlie.",S03E06,170
"Once that new baby comes along, you're just another middle child.",S03E06,171
Welcome to the forgotten kids club.,S03E06,172
"I Hope you enjoyed the spotlight,",S03E06,173
'cause that's over.,S03E06,174
"No, it's not.",S03E06,175
Denial.,S03E06,176
That's smart.,S03E06,177
Use that.,S03E06,178
That's what got me through kindergarten.,S03E06,179
"-Hey, honey.",S03E06,180
"-Bob, get over here.",S03E06,181
I just heard Gabe talking to Charlie.,S03E06,182
He said we're gonna forget about her when the new baby comes along.,S03E06,183
What? How could we forget about sweet little Charlie?,S03E06,184
"-She's adorable. -I know, but what about him?",S03E06,185
-Who? -Gabe!,S03E06,186
He's feeling neglected.,S03E06,187
Maybe we're not spending enough time with him.,S03E06,188
What are you talking about? I just took him to the batting cages.,S03E06,189
When he was 8.,S03E06,190
"Okay, so, what is he now, 10, 11?",S03E06,191
13.,S03E06,192

"Listen, I want to talk to you about my grade.",S03E06,202
-You gave me an incomplete -Mm-hmm.,S03E06,203
Which means I can't graduate tomorrow.,S03E06,204
So kind of big problem.,S03E06,205
Not for me.,S03E06,206
"The thing is, though, I only missed one unit.",S03E06,207
The most important unit of all,S03E06,208
The one that molds you into a man.,S03E06,209
"The one that combines athleticism and discipline,",S03E06,210
And prepares you for the hard realities of life.,S03E06,211
Square dancing?,S03E06,212
"That's right, cupcake.",S03E06,213
"No offense, but it just doesn't seem that important.",S03E06,214
Not important.,S03E06,215
What if you're walking down the street.,S03E06,216
And bang!  A hoedown breaks out?,S03E06,217
You wouldn't be prepared.,S03E06,218
"Well, you do make a good point there.",S03E06,219
"Listen, I really wanna graduate on time. Isn't there anything I can do?",S03E06,220
"-Well, there is one thing.",S03E06,221
-Yes.,S03E06,222
You can learn how to square dance by tomorrow.,S03E06,223
Just one little problem,S03E06,224
It's impossible.,S03E06,225
"Oh, yeah? I say it can be done.",S03E06,226
I'm gonna learn how to square dance by tomorrow.,S03E06,227
And I'm gonna stop calling everybody cupcake.,S03E06,228
"Ain't gonna happen, cupcake!",S03E06,229
"-Hey, T.",S03E06,230
-Hi.,S03E06,231
-What are you doing here? -I didn't know what to do.,S03E06,232
"-I've got no place else to go. -What's wrong, honey?",S03E06,233
"I've had the worst day. I have this big final tomorrow,",S03E06,234
And I can't find a quiet place to study.,S03E06,235
-I tried my house but -Was it your mom?,S03E06,236
It was everybody.,S03E06,237
But mainly your mom.,S03E06,238
"Teddy, you are always welcome here.",S03E06,239
Come on.,S03E06,240
"Go on, you just get yourself comfortable,",S03E06,241
And I will make you some tea.,S03E06,242
"Um, how come you never do any of this for me?",S03E06,243
I do this for people who study.,S03E06,244
Not worth it.,S03E06,245
"Hey, there he is.",S03E06,246
There's the guy we've been waiting for.,S03E06,247
"Honey, we saw this karaoke machine,",S03E06,248
And we thought of you.,S03E06,249
Because?,S03E06,250
Because we can sing together.,S03E06,251
Because?,S03E06,252
Because it'll be fun.,S03E06,253
Am I being punished?,S03E06,254
No.,S03E06,255
Your mom and I thought we just hadn't had enough gabe time lately.,S03E06,256
Oh.,S03E06,257
You're not talking about one of those stupid homemade coupons,S03E06,258
"I gave on mother's day, are you?",S03E06,259
Because those expired.,S03E06,260
"No, honey, we just want to spend more time with you.",S03E06,261
"Okay, now you look at this.",S03E06,262
And pick out any song you want.,S03E06,263
"And while you're doing that, I'll do this.",S03E06,264
"Bob, it's not a duet.",S03E06,265
"No, it never is, honey.",S03E06,266
Form a square and back you go,S03E06,267
Now meet your honey with a do-si-do,S03E06,268
Chicken in the bread pan pecking at dough,S03E06,269
"Skip to my Lou, my darlin'",S03E06,270
No no no no.,S03E06,271
Yep.,S03E06,272

"Ladies, do and, gents, you know",S03E06,274
"It's bow to your partner and off you go, swing her around",S03E06,275
-Let's take a break.,S03E06,276
-We don't have time.,S03E06,277
I gotta learn this.,S03E06,278
P.,S03E06,279
J.,S03E06,280
", we've been at it for over three hours,.",S03E06,281
And you still don't know a do-si from a do.,S03E06,282
Then why do you keep saying good good?,S03E06,283
I was talking about me.,S03E06,284
I was killing it.,S03E06,285
So that's it? I'm not gonna graduate?,S03E06,286
"-Sorry, buddy.",S03E06,287
-Oh man.,S03E06,288
"After barely passing the subjects that end in ology and ometry,",S03E06,289
I never thought it would be ancing that took me down.,S03E06,290
We're wanna show you one of our favorite movies,S03E06,291

You're gonna love this.,S03E06,293
It's about a giant squid.,S03E06,294
That terrorizes a small beach community.,S03E06,295
It's called Tentacles Over Pismo.,S03E06,296
I still have nightmares about it.,S03E06,297
"But don't worry, we will be right here with you the whole time.",S03E06,298
How much longer is gabe time gonna last?,S03E06,299
"Sweetie, we just want you to know.",S03E06,300
That just because you're the middle kid.,S03E06,301
Doesn't mean you're the forgotten kid.,S03E06,302
Oh!,S03E06,303
You guys overheard me say,S03E06,304
Shh! Movie's starting.,S03E06,305
"Come on now, snuggle with mommy.",S03E06,306
Eww! What's that?,S03E06,307

-Oh no. -What's going on?,S03E06,320
She's sleep-playing.,S03E06,321
She's what?,S03E06,322
You know how some people sleepwalk and sleep-talk?,S03E06,323
My mom plays the organ in her sleep.,S03E06,324
Can you wake her up? I have to study.,S03E06,325
You can't wake up a sleepwalker.,S03E06,326
It's dangerous.,S03E06,327
She'll be done soon.,S03E06,328
"As long as she doesn't start singing, we're good.",S03E06,329
O beautiful,S03E06,330
For spacious skies,S03E06,331
For Amber waves,S03E06,332
Of grain,S03E06,333
It's her salute to America.,S03E06,334

Unbelievable.,S03E06,336

"Charlie, I wanna talk to you about something.",S03E06,347
"-About what I said yesterday  -Bob, Bob, get over",S03E06,348
I was wrong.,S03E06,349
You don't have to worry about mom and dad forgetting you.,S03E06,350
"They might be busy,",S03E06,351
But they love us very much.,S03E06,352
-That is so sweet. -What is?,S03E06,353
Come on.,S03E06,354
"Well, I guess Gabe enjoys being the forgotten kid.",S03E06,355
"Yeah, sure sounds like it.",S03E06,356
"Hey, you know, if we were to forget him,",S03E06,357
Just every now and then,S03E06,358
That would be good parenting.,S03E06,359
You know what? I think I'm going to do my part.,S03E06,360
And forget him this week.,S03E06,361
And I shall ignore him all weekend.,S03E06,362
Mmm.,S03E06,363
Feels good.,S03E06,364
"Yeah, it always feels good to do the right thing.",S03E06,365
"Well, Duncan,",S03E06,366
Did you master the art of square dancing in 24 hours?,S03E06,367
"Actually, no.",S03E06,368
Then what are you wearing the cap and gown for?,S03E06,369
"Look, my parents are out there.",S03E06,370
They really wanna see me graduate.,S03E06,371
So I came back here to appeal to your sense of mercy.,S03E06,372
And humanity and,S03E06,373
Do you actually have any of those?,S03E06,374
Not since I started wearing the whistle.,S03E06,375
I'd like to welcome this year's south high graduating class!,S03E06,376
"I'll see you in the fall, Duncan.",S03E06,377
Hey.,S03E06,378
"Dad, what are you doing in here?",S03E06,379
"Emmett just told me everything that's going on,",S03E06,380
So I'm here to help you graduate.,S03E06,381
Forget it.,S03E06,382
It's over.,S03E06,383
I can't do it.,S03E06,384
"Oh yes, you can.",S03E06,385
You're a Duncan.,S03E06,386
You've got square dancing in your blood.,S03E06,387
"In High School, I was a square dancing champion.",S03E06,388
"Whoa, wait a minute.",S03E06,389
Are you do-si-do Duncan?,S03E06,390
"Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever.",S03E06,391
"That's great for you, dad, but how does that help me?",S03E06,392
It helps you like this.,S03E06,393
"Okay, start with your hand up, all right?",S03E06,394
"Hey, just follow my lead.",S03E06,395
"ladies, do, and, gents, you know",S03E06,396
it's bow to your partner and off we go,S03E06,397
"swing her around and, gents, you know",S03E06,398
once and a half and off we go,S03E06,399
swing your partner with your left hand,S03E06,400
then follow that up with a right-left grand,S03E06,401
"corn in the pigpen, beans in the sack",S03E06,402
circle right then promenade back,S03E06,403
two hands up and around you go,S03E06,404
"form a star, now do-si-do",S03E06,405
give your honey an allemande,S03E06,406
"dive for the oyster, dig for the clam",S03E06,407
form a square and back you go,S03E06,408
now meet your honey with a do-si-do,S03E06,409
"chicken in the bread pan, pecking at dough",S03E06,410
"skip to my Lou, my darlin'.",S03E06,411
Dang!,S03E06,412
That was beautiful.,S03E06,413
"-Does that mean -You can graduate, cupcake.",S03E06,414
"Whoo! Come on, let's go.",S03E06,415
"All right, let's go.",S03E06,416
"Sir,",S03E06,417
It was an honor to watch you work the square.,S03E06,418
"Well, I'll be back.",S03E06,419
"I got a daughter who can't dance, either.",S03E06,420
"Great news, Charlie.",S03E06,421
Guess who got an A on her european history final.,S03E06,422
Turns out the perfect place to study.,S03E06,423
Is at a tow truck office at 6:00 in the morning.,S03E06,424
"Well, I am very proud of you.",S03E06,425
-And speaking of proud -I graduated!,S03E06,426
"It's upside down, honey.",S03E06,427
I still graduated.,S03E06,428
"In other news,",S03E06,429
Everyone in the family has picked out two names for the new baby.,S03E06,430
Mom and dad are gonna choose from one of these.,S03E06,431
"So any favorites, mom?",S03E06,432
I'm not saying.,S03E06,433
I see that candy and hot dog have made a reappearance.,S03E06,434
"If you're watching this with your little brother hot dog,",S03E06,435
"Wish him lots of good luck, Charlie.",S03E06,436
"Hey, guys,",S03E06,437
Mom and dad were talking about this thing called potty training.,S03E06,438
What's that?,S03E06,439
You know that room at the end of the hall?,S03E06,440
The one with the weird chair?,S03E06,441
"Yeah, that chair is called a toilet.",S03E06,442
They're gonna make us learn how to use it.,S03E06,443
Toilet?,S03E06,444
What's wrong with the current system?,S03E06,445
I am very happy in diapers.,S03E06,446
Me too.,S03E06,447
I love diapers.,S03E06,448
"Not loving this one, though.",S03E06,449
Yeah.,S03E06,450
I could go for a change.,S03E06,451
Shall we?,S03E06,452
I'm coming.,S03E06,453
You don't get that kind of service on the toilet.,S03E06,454
"Hey, Charlie.",S03E07,0
"So, exciting times for the Duncan family.",S03E07,1
"Tomorrow, you turn three!",S03E07,2
Yay!,S03E07,3
"And if that wasn't exciting enough, one week ago, the new baby was due.",S03E07,4
Let's see how that baby's doing now.,S03E07,5
I want you out!,S03E07,6
Duncan kid number five is late.,S03E07,7
And Duncan kid number two is getting on my nerves.,S03E07,8
Moving on.,S03E07,9
"Anyway, I'm hoping for a baby girl.",S03E07,10
I'm hoping for a baby boy.,S03E07,11
Yeah.,S03E07,12
Me too.,S03E07,13
I want a younger brother to pick on.,S03E07,14
I'm tired of picking on my older brother.,S03E07,15
"Oh, boy or girl doesn't matter to me.",S03E07,16
"Whatever Mom wants, I want.",S03E07,17
Don't touch me.,S03E07,18
"Never again, honey.",S03E07,19
Once again I've kept the camera on just a smidge too long.,S03E07,20
"Guys, this is all just too much.",S03E07,21
"The new baby's about to come, and Charlie's birthday tomorrow.",S03E07,22
Just so long as they don't happen on the same day.,S03E07,23
"-What do you mean? -Well, think about it.",S03E07,24
Wouldn't it be kind of sad if Charlie had to,S03E07,25
share her birthday with the new baby?,S03E07,26
I'll tell you what's sad.,S03E07,27
We're out of French Toast sticks.,S03E07,28
"Teddy, honey, the baby's gonna come when the baby wants to come.",S03E07,29
"But if it does happen to be tomorrow,",S03E07,30
I need everyone to help out with Charlie's birthday.,S03E07,31
"Mom, I'm willing to help out by doing what I always do.",S03E07,32
You don't ever do anything.,S03E07,33
And nobody does it better.,S03E07,34
All I'm saying is if somebody goes to the trouble,S03E07,35
"of inventing French Toast sticks, the least we could do is buy their product.",S03E07,36
"Bob, honey, you took care of those things I asked you to handle, right?",S03E07,37
I.,S03E07,38
Certainly did.,S03E07,39
Why was there a pause between I and certainly?,S03E07,40
No pause.,S03E07,41
Just my normal speaking.,S03E07,42
Talk voice pattern.,S03E07,43
"So, you bought the baby's new car seat,",S03E07,44
and the doll Charlie wants for her birthday?,S03E07,45
Honey.,S03E07,46
I did it all.,S03E07,47
Okay? Mission accomplished.,S03E07,48
I.,S03E07,49
Believe you.,S03E07,50
"Uh, Gabe?",S03E07,51
"-Yeah? -Listen, here is, uh.",S03E07,52
Here's 50 bucks.,S03E07,53
I need you to go down to the mall.,S03E07,54
I need you to get that doll for Charlie.,S03E07,55
"Dad, why can't you do it?",S03E07,56
Because I gotta buy a car seat.,S03E07,57
You know how some little girls grow up,S03E07,58
and pick a husband who's just like their Daddy?,S03E07,59
I'm gonna go a different way.,S03E07,60
Today's all burnt toast ,S03E07,61
"Running late, and dad jokes",S03E07,62
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S03E07,63
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S03E07,64
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S03E07,65
There it is up on the roof,S03E07,66
"I've been there, I've survived",S03E07,67
So just take my advice,S03E07,68
"Hang in there, baby",S03E07,69
Things are crazy,S03E07,70
But I know your future's bright,S03E07,71
"Hang in there, baby",S03E07,72
There's no maybe,S03E07,73
Everything turns out all right,S03E07,74
Your life is up and down,S03E07,75
But trust me it comes back around,S03E07,76
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S03E07,77
"Hang in there, baby.",S03E07,78
"Hey, honey?",S03E07,79
"Hey, come on.",S03E07,80
There's something I want to show you.,S03E07,81
"Honey, come on.",S03E07,82
I'm moving as fast as I can.,S03E07,83
Wide load coming through.,S03E07,84
Look.,S03E07,85
Look.,S03E07,86
New car seat is in.,S03E07,87
-Good.,S03E07,88
-Yeah.,S03E07,89
Bought it three days ago.,S03E07,90
"Well, whatever.",S03E07,91
Looks a little crowded in here.,S03E07,92
"Well, honey, we're gonna be up front. Who cares what happens in the back?",S03E07,93
"Bob, I don't think there's enough room.",S03E07,94
Sure there is.,S03E07,95
"No, Bob, with five kids, I think we might need a new car.",S03E07,96
Slow down.,S03E07,97
"No, no, no, no, no.",S03E07,98
Enough room in here for everybody.,S03E07,99
"Look, Charlie sits here, new baby over there,",S03E07,100
"one kid back there, the other over there.",S03E07,101
Done.,S03E07,102
Problem solved.,S03E07,103
You forgot a kid.,S03E07,104
Which one?,S03E07,105
I don't know.,S03E07,106
But I know there are five.,S03E07,107
This can work.,S03E07,108
Let me show you.,S03E07,109
Kids!.,S03E07,110
"There, see?",S03E07,111
Piece of cake.,S03E07,112
How's everybody doing back there?,S03E07,113
PJ keeps poking me with his rib.,S03E07,114
It's called breathing.,S03E07,115
"Honey, Gabe doesn't have a seat belt.",S03E07,116
Or a seat.,S03E07,117
He'll be fine.,S03E07,118
"Hey, Charlie?",S03E07,119
Are you comfortable?,S03E07,120
No.,S03E07,121
-Bob? -Yes?,S03E07,122
-New car? -New car.,S03E07,123
Okay.,S03E07,124
Here we go.,S03E07,125
Oh.,S03E07,126
"Hey, Mom? Oh.",S03E07,127
What are you doing?,S03E07,128
Painting my toenails.,S03E07,129
Just because I can't see them doesn't mean they shouldn't look good.,S03E07,130
Oh.,S03E07,131
"Well in that case, you might want to consider clipping them.",S03E07,132
Can I help you?,S03E07,133
"Well, I am actually here to help you.",S03E07,134
"So, Mom, I know that you've been very anxious",S03E07,135
"to get this baby out, so I went online",S03E07,136
and I looked up some natural ways to induce labor.,S03E07,137
"Ooh, like what?",S03E07,138
"Well, uh, there's a bunch of techniques, but the first one includes.",S03E07,139
Boo!,S03E07,140
What was that?,S03E07,141
I was trying to scare the baby out.,S03E07,142
"Well, it didn't work.",S03E07,143
Okay.,S03E07,144
"Fine, well, there's always some other stuff we can try, like.",S03E07,145
Boo!,S03E07,146
Stop that.,S03E07,147
"Okay, you know, it's a baby.",S03E07,148
It's not the hiccups.,S03E07,149
"So, what do you want to do today?",S03E07,150
"Well, it's a beautiful day.",S03E07,151
"Sun shining, the birds are chirping.",S03E07,152
"So, video games in the basement?",S03E07,153
"Dude, you had me scared there for a minute with all the outdoor talk.",S03E07,154
"All right, let's go.",S03E07,155
Wait.,S03E07,156
I promised my Dad I'd go to the store and buy Charlie a stupid doll.,S03E07,157
And I told my Mom I was at the library.,S03E07,158
So what?,S03E07,159
"No, Jake, I really have to go do this.",S03E07,160
"So, who's stopping you?",S03E07,161
I'll wait right here.,S03E07,162
"Yeah, you know I'm not allowed to leave you in this house alone.",S03E07,163
Come on.,S03E07,164
"Man, you take one bubble bath, you get labeled.",S03E07,165
What's all this?,S03E07,166
I got us some yoga balls.,S03E07,167
Another way to induce labor is through bouncing.,S03E07,168
"All right, I'll try anything.",S03E07,169
"Hit it, Charlie.",S03E07,170
Feel anything?,S03E07,171
I feel silly.,S03E07,172
You look silly.,S03E07,173
Oh.,S03E07,174
"Teddy, this isn't going to work.",S03E07,175
Do it again.,S03E07,176
"Dude, I can't be seen doll shopping.",S03E07,177
I'll lose my street cred.,S03E07,178
"Yeah, I think you lost that when you started giggling in the bra Department.",S03E07,179
Let's just buy this thing and get out of here.,S03E07,180
Kuddle Me Katie?,S03E07,181
That's stupid.,S03E07,182
Goo-goo.,S03E07,183
It said goo-goo.,S03E07,184
"Whoa, look what they just released.",S03E07,185
Attack of the Zartians.,S03E07,186
"Oh, right.",S03E07,187
I heard about this game.,S03E07,188
Zartians are martians that were bitten by zombies.,S03E07,189
Ewe.,S03E07,190
That's disgusting.,S03E07,191
"What are they covered in, blood or puke?",S03E07,192
Hopefully both.,S03E07,193
Let's get it.,S03E07,194
It's 50 bucks.,S03E07,195
I don't have 50 bucks.,S03E07,196
"Yeah, you do.",S03E07,197
Wait a minute.,S03E07,198
-Are you.,S03E07,199
Are you saying.,S03E07,200
-That's exactly what I'm saying.,S03E07,201
You're gonna buy this game with the doll money.,S03E07,202
Yeah.,S03E07,203
-And then what? -We play it.,S03E07,204
-After we play it? -We play it again.,S03E07,205
"Well, what about Charlie's doll?",S03E07,206
I promised my Dad.,S03E07,207
"Dude, we're teenagers now.",S03E07,208
We're supposed to be rebels.,S03E07,209
Your Mom still picks out your underwear.,S03E07,210
And sometimes I wear it backwards.,S03E07,211
On purpose.,S03E07,212
"You know what? I'm gonna buy this game,",S03E07,213
but just so we can stop talking about your underwear.,S03E07,214
"Hey, Mom.",S03E07,215
How you doing?,S03E07,216
"I am tired, bloated, cranky, I have never been more miserable in my life.",S03E07,217
That's nice.,S03E07,218
Hey.,S03E07,219
I just did a quick freezer check.,S03E07,220
Still not seeing the French Toast sticks.,S03E07,221
I bought you some.,S03E07,222
"Yeah, you bought French Toast squares.",S03E07,223
"Well, if you want sticks, then just take the squares and cut them in half.",S03E07,224
Cut them in half?,S03E07,225
But then you cut the fun in half.,S03E07,226
"Honey, you'll figure it out.",S03E07,227
I guess I could take the cut squares.,S03E07,228
And glue them together lengthwise with syrup.,S03E07,229
Or would jam make a better adhesive?,S03E07,230
I'd better nap on it.,S03E07,231
"That's your big brother, PJ.",S03E07,232
He's not the smartest.,S03E07,233
That's it.,S03E07,234
"Hey, Mom. You hungry?",S03E07,235
"Oh, no.",S03E07,236
"Honey, I couldn't eat anything.",S03E07,237
"I'm so big, I just.",S03E07,238
I just.,S03E07,239
What you got?,S03E07,240
Vindaloo Pepper Curry from the new Indian place.,S03E07,241
Because I read that another way to induce labor is with spicy food.,S03E07,242
Is it really that spicy?,S03E07,243
"Yeah, so spicy, they made me sign a waiver.",S03E07,244
And attend a brief seminar.,S03E07,245
Let's try it.,S03E07,246
Dad!,S03E07,247
"I set that down, like, one minute ago.",S03E07,248
Stuff's got some kick to it.,S03E07,249
What else you got?,S03E07,250
"So, uh, how is belly dancing supposed to help?",S03E07,251
"Well, they say that it's good to exercise your core, and.",S03E07,252
"Let's face it, right now.",S03E07,253
You're all core.,S03E07,254
Oh.,S03E07,255
"Check it out, this is fun.",S03E07,256
"And surprise, surprise.",S03E07,257
I'm good at it.,S03E07,258
"Feel anything, Mom?",S03E07,259
Feel like I'm kicking your butt at belly dancing.,S03E07,260
"-Oh, no, you're not.",S03E07,261
"-Oh, yes, I am.",S03E07,262
-Bring it.,S03E07,263
-Consider it brung.,S03E07,264
-Oh! -Yeah!,S03E07,265
"Yeah, you just got served.",S03E07,266
"In a bowl, with a spoon.",S03E07,267
Didn't realize belly dancing had so much trash talk.,S03E07,268
"Man, this is frustrating.",S03E07,269
"Yeah, I know.",S03E07,270
They really need to make bigger keyboards,S03E07,271
"for people with big, sausage-y fingers.",S03E07,272
What are you talking about?,S03E07,273
What are you talking about?,S03E07,274
I'm trying to figure out what kind of car to buy.,S03E07,275
"Problem is, you got too many choices.",S03E07,276
And then you gotta figure out.,S03E07,277
Mileage and.,S03E07,278
"Color, safety, reliability.",S03E07,279
You know what? This is impossible.,S03E07,280
"Well, what about this one?",S03E07,281
"I mean, look how happy it's making that family.",S03E07,282
"Oh, and they're going across the country.",S03E07,283
Mount Rushmore.,S03E07,284
The Grand Canyon.,S03E07,285
Grandma's house.,S03E07,286
PJ.,S03E07,287
"Come on, it's just a commercial, you.",S03E07,288
"Hey, they brought her a puppy.",S03E07,289
"Oh, it's just what she wanted.",S03E07,290
We have to get that car.,S03E07,291
If we want to be happy.,S03E07,292
"Okay, how is a salad going to help me go into labor?",S03E07,293
"Not the salad, the dressing.",S03E07,294
"See, this place is famous for it.",S03E07,295
They have this special secret ingredient that just pops a kid right out.,S03E07,296
It's worth a shot.,S03E07,297
"Besides, I haven't eaten in like, 15 minutes.",S03E07,298
Hi. Can I help you?,S03E07,299
Yes.,S03E07,300
"A table for two, please.",S03E07,301
"Sure, can I get your name? We have about a three-hour wait.",S03E07,302
Three hours?,S03E07,303
But we need a table right away.,S03E07,304
"Yes, I'm pregnant.",S03E07,305
It's kind of a special circumstance.,S03E07,306
"Oh, well, in that case, you can wait in our special section.",S03E07,307
This is ridiculous.,S03E07,308
I can't believe they're making us stand here like this.,S03E07,309
I'm seven days overdue.,S03E07,310
Seven days?,S03E07,311
Try nine days on for size.,S03E07,312
I'm looking back at seven days like it was a party.,S03E07,313
"Oh, yeah?",S03E07,314
I have enough gas to fly to London.,S03E07,315
Try China.,S03E07,316
How's that table coming?,S03E07,317
-All right.,S03E07,318
-I can't wait to play this game.,S03E07,319
"Yeah, I was getting that from the way you opened the box with your teeth.",S03E07,320
That's how I open everything.,S03E07,321
Why do you think I need braces?,S03E07,322
"Now, if my Dad comes down.",S03E07,323
"And asks where the doll is, what am I gonna tell him?",S03E07,324
"Okay, I got it.",S03E07,325
I'll tell him that.,S03E07,326
"On the way to the toy store, I got beat up by a gang.",S03E07,327
And.,S03E07,328
They stole the money and I'm lucky to be alive.,S03E07,329
"Dude, it's your Dad we're talking about.",S03E07,330
Why are you working so hard on a story?,S03E07,331
You know what?,S03E07,332
You're right.,S03E07,333
Why am I worried about Charlie's stupid doll anyway?,S03E07,334
"All right, here.",S03E07,335
Uh-oh. What's that?,S03E07,336
Warning.,S03E07,337
Contains scenes of graphic violence.,S03E07,338
Parental supervision strongly advised.,S03E07,339
Yes!,S03E07,340
"Well, I retain so much water, I slosh when I walk.",S03E07,341
I slosh when I sleep.,S03E07,342
"Oh, you sleep?",S03E07,343
"Oh, Mom.",S03E07,344
I just thought of a great idea.,S03E07,345
Why don't we get the salads to go?,S03E07,346
Don't you think we thought of that?,S03E07,347
They don't do takeout here.,S03E07,348
Sure hope your next kid is smarter than this one.,S03E07,349
Hey.,S03E07,350
Nobody insults my kids but me.,S03E07,351
You want a piece of me?,S03E07,352
"-You want a piece of me? -Okay! Ladies, let's break it up.",S03E07,353
"Let's just go, okay? I can't do this for three hours.",S03E07,354
"What? No, Mom.",S03E07,355
We have to stick it out.,S03E07,356
The baby has to be born today.,S03E07,357
Tomorrow's Charlie's birthday.,S03E07,358
"Honey, I know that.",S03E07,359
But we're out of options here.,S03E07,360
Or are we?,S03E07,361
Look over there.,S03E07,362
That must be the salad dressing.,S03E07,363
"Okay, so you create a distraction for everyone, and I'll go get it.",S03E07,364
We're going to steal salad dressing?,S03E07,365
The student becomes the master.,S03E07,366
Oh my!,S03E07,367
Oh my! It's happening.,S03E07,368
"Oh, Mama's having a baby child!",S03E07,369
"Okay, just stay calm.",S03E07,370
Everything's gonna be okay.,S03E07,371
-Okay.,S03E07,372
-Just breathe.,S03E07,373
"Oh, you know what?",S03E07,374
False alarm.,S03E07,375
Sorry.,S03E07,376
"Everybody go back to your salads, nothing more to see here.",S03E07,377
Oh.,S03E07,378
Let's get out of here.,S03E07,379
"Hey! Stop them, they've got the dressing.",S03E07,380
Run for it!,S03E07,381
Oh.,S03E07,382
Okay.,S03E07,383
"Hey, everybody relax.",S03E07,384
"Yeah, no need to get crazy, okay, there's plenty of dressing for everyone.",S03E07,385
I am having twins.,S03E07,386
I want double.,S03E07,387
"Oh, yeah? I'm gonna need to see an ultrasound.",S03E07,388
"Hey, hey! Back off.",S03E07,389
One more step and the dressing gets it.,S03E07,390
That's right.,S03E07,391
You heard her.,S03E07,392
Now everyone waddle away real nice-like.,S03E07,393
"You first, twinsie.",S03E07,394
"So, Bob.",S03E07,395
What got you interested in the Serenade?,S03E07,396
"Well, the mileage, safety, reliability.",S03E07,397
Was it the puppy?,S03E07,398
Yeah.,S03E07,399
"So, what do you think?",S03E07,400
"Rides pretty smooth, doesn't it?",S03E07,401
"Yeah, it's.",S03E07,402
"It's okay, I guess.",S03E07,403
Are you kidding?,S03E07,404
I feel like I'm floating on a cloud.,S03E07,405
A cloud with seat warmers.,S03E07,406
So that's why I'm so toasty down there.,S03E07,407
Sounds like your boy likes the car.,S03E07,408
Six cup holders?!,S03E07,409
Serenade! Serenade!,S03E07,410
Serenade!,S03E07,411
"What do you say, Bob?",S03E07,412
You want to go inside and we'll crunch some numbers?,S03E07,413
Um.,S03E07,414
"Could you give us a minute, Stu?.",S03E07,415
Sure thing.,S03E07,416
I'll be in the showroom.,S03E07,417
PJ!,S03E07,418
What are you doing? You're blowing the whole deal!,S03E07,419
What do you mean?,S03E07,420
"If Stu thinks we like the car, we're gonna have to pay more for it.",S03E07,421
We gotta make him think we don't want the car.,S03E07,422
So there's a chance we won't buy it?,S03E07,423
Are you kidding me? I love this thing!,S03E07,424
Serenade! Serenade! Serenade!,S03E07,425
Never knew pregnant women could be so vicious.,S03E07,426
It was horrifying.,S03E07,427
That one gal chewed off a couple of my buttons.,S03E07,428
Why don't we go downstairs again and try bouncing.,S03E07,429
"Oh, no, no, no, no.",S03E07,430
"Sweetie, we are done.",S03E07,431
"Okay, we've tried everything.",S03E07,432
This baby is gonna come when it wants to.,S03E07,433
I guess you're right.,S03E07,434
"And if it is born on Charlie's birthday,",S03E07,435
maybe that wouldn't be such a bad thing.,S03E07,436
What do you mean?,S03E07,437
"Well, I don't know, with.",S03E07,438
"Five kids, maybe it wouldn't hurt to double up on birthdays.",S03E07,439
You know.,S03E07,440
"Less parties, less presents, less headaches.",S03E07,441
Hey.,S03E07,442
Maybe I can tell Charlie and the baby they were born on December 25.,S03E07,443
"So, follow my lead.",S03E07,444
Play it cool.,S03E07,445
"Oh, and whatever happens, don't get too overenthusiastic.",S03E07,446
"Don't worry about me, big guy.",S03E07,447
I will be cool with a capital K.,S03E07,448
And don't do any spelling.,S03E07,449
Check.,S03E07,450
"Have a seat, fellas.",S03E07,451
In these chairs?,S03E07,452
Forget it.,S03E07,453
They're pieces of junk.,S03E07,454
We're not buying the chairs.,S03E07,455
Darn right we're not.,S03E07,456
It's not even that fun.,S03E07,457
"So, what do you think, Bob?",S03E07,458
Will you be driving home in a Serenade today?,S03E07,459
"Well, uh.",S03E07,460
"I don't know, Stu.",S03E07,461
"I guess it, uh, depends on what you can do for me.",S03E07,462
"Yeah, Stu. What have you got?",S03E07,463
Bring it.,S03E07,464
Does this price work for you?,S03E07,465
Does.,S03E07,466
This work for you?.,S03E07,467
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. PJ, PJ?",S03E07,468
We actually have to look at the offers.,S03E07,469
"Amateur move, but go ahead.",S03E07,470
"Look, Bob.",S03E07,471
I want to make you happy.,S03E07,472
What do you think about this?,S03E07,473
This is your offer?,S03E07,474
PJ.,S03E07,475
"This is your beef, Stu?",S03E07,476
Get it? Beef Stu?,S03E07,477
"-Yeah, we.",S03E07,478
We all got it.,S03E07,479
-Yeah.,S03E07,480
"Come on, Dad.",S03E07,481
We are out of here.,S03E07,482
Dad? You coming?,S03E07,483
"I, uh.",S03E07,484
"Chose the wrong child to come with me today, Stu.",S03E07,485
I.,S03E07,486
I apologize.,S03E07,487
How long have we been playing?,S03E07,488
Six hours.,S03E07,489
My eyes are burning.,S03E07,490
You should blink once in a while.,S03E07,491
That's exactly what they want.,S03E07,492
"Who are you working for, the Zartian King?",S03E07,493
"Easy, dude.",S03E07,494
Your phone's ringing again.,S03E07,495
It's just my Mom wondering where I am.,S03E07,496
Off to voice mail.,S03E07,497
I'm gonna go down this alley and check for mutants.,S03E07,498
Cover me.,S03E07,499
"You having fun, Gabe?",S03E07,500
Whoa.,S03E07,501
Did you see that?,S03E07,502
What?,S03E07,503
My Dad.,S03E07,504
He was.,S03E07,505
He was in the game and he was talking to me.,S03E07,506
That's normal.,S03E07,507
"After six hours, you're gonna hallucinate.",S03E07,508
Really?,S03E07,509
Yeah.,S03E07,510
It was a warning on the box.,S03E07,511
You've just got to power through it.,S03E07,512
Okay.,S03E07,513
You're right.,S03E07,514
Just got to focus.,S03E07,515
We got to get that level nine monster.,S03E07,516
It's your baby sister's birthday.,S03E07,517
All she wanted was a doll.,S03E07,518
Maybe you're the monster.,S03E07,519
Ah!,S03E07,520
What are you doing?,S03E07,521
We're done.,S03E07,522
And tomorrow we're taking the game back and getting Charlie her doll.,S03E07,523
What's wrong with your hands?,S03E07,524
I don't know.,S03E07,525
Help me.,S03E07,526
"Oh, happy first birthday, you adorable baby.",S03E07,527
Look at that smile.,S03E07,528
Check out those cheeks.,S03E07,529
I could just eat you up.,S03E07,530
You are the cutest baby ever.,S03E07,531
"Yes, you are.",S03E07,532
"It's my birthday, too.",S03E07,533
"Oh, and Daddy loves you.",S03E07,534
"That's right, Daddy lu-lu you.",S03E07,535
I'm sad.,S03E07,536
"Oh, my little angel.",S03E07,537
I could never forget you.,S03E07,538
"I'll never forget you either, baby.",S03E07,539
Not you.,S03E07,540
Teddy.,S03E07,541
"Morning, Mom.",S03E07,542
"Teddy, I can't have this baby today.",S03E07,543
Charlie needs to have her special birthday.,S03E07,544
That's what I've been saying all along.,S03E07,545
"Yeah, but now I'm saying it.",S03E07,546
"Okay, well, what made you change your mind?",S03E07,547
I had this horrible dream last night.,S03E07,548
The entire family was just being so mean to Charlie.,S03E07,549
Ignoring her.,S03E07,550
Even you.,S03E07,551
What were you doing in the dream?,S03E07,552
I was doing what I always do.,S03E07,553
Fighting bravely to make things right.,S03E07,554
"Okay, look, the point is I can't have the baby today.",S03E07,555
Charlie needs her special day.,S03E07,556
"All right, well, however you got here, I totally agree.",S03E07,557
We'll just make sure that you don't have the baby until tomorrow.,S03E07,558
Exactly.,S03E07,559
Okay.,S03E07,560
"Okay, operation get baby out.",S03E07,561
Has officially become operation keep baby in.,S03E07,562
"I need complete rest and relaxation, okay?",S03E07,563
Nothing but peace.,S03E07,564
Calm.,S03E07,565
And quiet.,S03E07,566
"Morning, honey.",S03E07,567
I said quiet!,S03E07,568
Yeah.,S03E07,569
Another day in paradise.,S03E07,570
Next.,S03E07,571
"Hi, we'd like to return this game, please.",S03E07,572
Has it been opened?,S03E07,573
Nope.,S03E07,574
Then why is it covered in tape and what appears to be teeth marks?,S03E07,575
Okay.,S03E07,576
I'm gonna level with you.,S03E07,577
We bought this game by accident.,S03E07,578
"And then, Jake here.",S03E07,579
Accidentally opened it.,S03E07,580
And then we accidentally played it for six hours.,S03E07,581
"Guys, I'm sorry, you can't return this.",S03E07,582
"Oh, no, we don't want to return it.",S03E07,583
We want to exchange it.,S03E07,584
For money.,S03E07,585
Next.,S03E07,586
"Oh, this is bad.",S03E07,587
What am I gonna do?,S03E07,588
Only thing you can do.,S03E07,589
You gotta steal the doll.,S03E07,590
Steal the doll? But that's wrong.,S03E07,591
"Well, exactly.",S03E07,592
"You know the old saying, two wrongs make a right.",S03E07,593
"No, it's two wrongs don't make a right.",S03E07,594
Oh.,S03E07,595
"Well, then, you know the other old saying.",S03E07,596
Sometimes you gotta steal a doll.,S03E07,597
I'm not gonna steal the doll.,S03E07,598
"Well, can we at least steal candy?",S03E07,599
No.,S03E07,600
Then what's the point of even going to the store?,S03E07,601
Serenade!,S03E07,602
Serenade!,S03E07,603
Serenade!,S03E07,604
Yeah.,S03E07,605
Oh.,S03E07,606
Well.,S03E07,607
Hope you learned something from the whole car-buying experience.,S03E07,608
"Sure did, Dad.",S03E07,609
"What's that, son?",S03E07,610
"Can't we just leave it at a sure did, Dad?",S03E07,611
I'm talking about the negotiation.,S03E07,612
Look.,S03E07,613
Someday you're gonna have a family of your own.,S03E07,614
And you're gonna have to buy a new car.,S03E07,615
And you know what you're gonna say to your kid?,S03E07,616
The car doesn't fit in the garage?,S03E07,617
What?,S03E07,618
"Then I'll say, it's not my fault, son.",S03E07,619
I learned all this from your grandpa Bob.,S03E07,620
"And he'll say, oh, that explains it.",S03E07,621
Then we'll laugh and get ice cream.,S03E07,622
"Well, you asked.",S03E07,623
Then everybody was being really mean to you.,S03E07,624
"But don't you worry, I did what I always do.",S03E07,625
Fought bravely to make things right.,S03E07,626
"Charlie, you have the best Mommy in the world.",S03E07,627
Even in a dream.,S03E07,628
Charlie?,S03E07,629
I made you a special birthday lunch.,S03E07,630
It's in the kitchen.,S03E07,631
Let's go get it.,S03E07,632
Yay.,S03E07,633
"Okay, um, Mom.",S03E07,634
I was just wondering about Charlie's birthday party.,S03E07,635
"Oh, honey.",S03E07,636
I have to rest.,S03E07,637
Would you please take care of that for me?,S03E07,638
"Yeah, I got it.",S03E07,639
Everything you need to know is in a file in the kitchen.,S03E07,640
Got it.,S03E07,641
"Teddy, you have really been there for me, and I just.",S03E07,642
"I'm just so thankful, and.",S03E07,643
You're my rock.,S03E07,644
I don't know what I'd do without you.,S03E07,645
Yeah.,S03E07,646
"How are the hormones, Mom?",S03E07,647
All over the place.,S03E07,648
"Charlie, how'd you like your special pony-shaped sandwich?",S03E07,649
All right.,S03E07,650
Well.,S03E07,651
Glad I spent an hour cutting it out.,S03E07,652
Party folder.,S03E07,653
"Hey, Charlie, come with me.",S03E07,654
Ready? Oh! I got cha.,S03E07,655
Okay.,S03E07,656
What?,S03E07,657
Mom forgot to mail the invitations?,S03E07,658
Do you know what this means?,S03E07,659
No.,S03E07,660
Good.,S03E07,661
You wait here.,S03E07,662
I'll be right back.,S03E07,663
"Dad, hi.",S03E07,664
Okay.,S03E07,665
Big problem.,S03E07,666
So you know how Mom's been kinda spacey with the pregnancy?.,S03E07,667
"Well, she forgot to plan Charlie's birthday party.",S03E07,668
You think you got problems?,S03E07,669
The garage is 31 inches too short.,S03E07,670
"Oh, the garage is too short?",S03E07,671
Now it's the garage's fault?,S03E07,672
"Yeah, car-buying expert here didn't measure the.",S03E07,673
She doesn't need to know the details.,S03E07,674
She has her own situation.,S03E07,675
"Didn't you hear? Mom made a big, dumb mistake.",S03E07,676
"Well, so what.",S03E07,677
What am I gonna do?.,S03E07,678
Charlie's in there waiting for her party.,S03E07,679
"Okay, all right.",S03E07,680
"Give me, uh.",S03E07,681
Give me a minute to think.,S03E07,682
"Uh, bu.",S03E07,683
Bu.,S03E07,684
Bu.,S03E07,685
Ba.,S03E07,686
Okay.,S03E07,687
Give me another minute.,S03E07,688
"Well, I.",S03E07,689
I guess I could try calling some of Charlie's friends.,S03E07,690
See if they can come over.,S03E07,691
Pick up a cake at the store.,S03E07,692
Before you buy the cake.,S03E07,693
You might wanna measure the fridge.,S03E07,694
"Know what I'm saying, Dad?",S03E07,695
"Hi uh, Mrs.",S03E07,696
"Dickson, it's Teddy Duncan calling.",S03E07,697
"Listen, so I'm throwing together",S03E07,698
"a little last-minute birthday party for Charlie,",S03E07,699
and I was just wondering if Megan could come.,S03E07,700
Oh.,S03E07,701
Chicken pox.,S03E07,702
Poor little thing.,S03E07,703
"But, you know, she doesn't have to stay for long.",S03E07,704
Okay.,S03E07,705
"Okay, I understand.",S03E07,706
"Oh, you know what?",S03E07,707
As long as I've got you.,S03E07,708
Is there any chance that Mr.,S03E07,709
Dickson is a.,S03E07,710
"Is a clown or a magician, or.",S03E07,711
Hello?,S03E07,712
"Hi um, is this Cake World?",S03E07,713
"Yeah, yeah, hi.",S03E07,714
I need a cake.,S03E07,715
Um.,S03E07,716
You're out of cake?,S03E07,717
You realize you're called Cake World.,S03E07,718
"Which means, right now, you're just world.",S03E07,719
"Yeah, well, I don't like your attitude, either.",S03E07,720
Hello?,S03E07,721

"Yeah um, listen, I know that it's last minute,",S03E07,724
but I'm trying to put together this birthday party.,S03E07,725
What's the most amazing animal you've got?,S03E07,726
A monkey who does tricks for cake.,S03E07,727
"Yeah, we're gonna have a problem.",S03E07,728
"Um, by any chance.",S03E07,729
Does the monkey come with its own cake?,S03E07,730
Hello?,S03E07,731
Who's coming to my party?,S03E07,732
"You know, I'm really not sure.",S03E07,733
"Hey, you know who might be fun to have at your party?",S03E07,734
Who?,S03E07,735
The kids from the playground.,S03E07,736

"Well, we won't know until we get there.",S03E07,739
Yay!,S03E07,740

Could you just press the button?,S03E07,745
"All right, here it goes.",S03E07,746
Looking good.,S03E07,747
Looking good.,S03E07,748
So close.,S03E07,749
PJ was right.,S03E07,750
The squares aren't as much fun as the sticks.,S03E07,751
But I'm gonna eat some more anyway.,S03E07,752
"So, what are you gonna do?",S03E07,753
"Well, what choice do I have? I have to tell my Dad the truth.",S03E07,754
"The truth? Dude, that game messed you up.",S03E07,755
"You know, if you came in and shared some of the blame,",S03E07,756
they'd probably go easier on me.,S03E07,757
Guess we'll never know.,S03E07,758
Gotta admit.,S03E07,759
I like that kid's style.,S03E07,760
"Okay, you.",S03E07,761

This is ridiculous.,S03E07,771
"Dad, calm down.",S03E07,772
"No, that's it! That's it!",S03E07,773
I'm done. Done!,S03E07,774
Taking this tank back to the.,S03E07,775
Dealer!.,S03E07,776
Dealer's that way.,S03E07,777
Oh! Oh!,S03E07,778
"It looks bad from this side, too.",S03E07,779
"Dad, I have to tell you some.",S03E07,780
It can wait.,S03E07,781
"Hey, Dad.",S03E07,782
Great news.,S03E07,783
Garage door closes.,S03E07,784
"Guys, Charlie's birthday party is.",S03E07,785
Not our biggest problem.,S03E07,786
"Why do you keep saying, uh-oh?",S03E07,787
Why do you think?,S03E07,788
The baby's coming.,S03E07,789
"-Oh! -Okay, all right.",S03E07,790
We gotta get Mom to the hospital.,S03E07,791

"Ed? So is that short for uh, Edward?",S03E07,799
Edgar? Edwin?,S03E07,800

"-Bigger issues, PJ!.",S03E07,803
"Okay, we really need to go.",S03E07,804
"Okay, come on.",S03E07,805
You guys have to throw Charlie her birthday party.,S03E07,806
I'm gonna drive Mom to the hospital.,S03E07,807
"Oh, why do we always get the hard things?",S03E07,808
You know.,S03E07,809
I always thought you would be the first one to drive a car into the kitchen.,S03E07,810
"Me, too.",S03E07,811
"Hey, how you doing, honey?",S03E07,812
It'd be a lot better if you were quiet!,S03E07,813
She wants me to be quiet.,S03E07,814
Gotta be quiet. Why can't I be quiet?,S03E07,815
"Dad, were you this panicky when the rest of us were born?",S03E07,816
Uh.,S03E07,817

"Because the first four times we did this, we were at a hospital!",S03E07,819
"We did this, yeah.",S03E07,820
"Yeah, you wanna take over?!",S03E07,821

Right after this.,S03E07,825
Slight delay.,S03E07,826
You're outta gas.,S03E07,827
"You're outta gas! Aw, Teddy.",S03E07,828
How could you be so irresponsible?!,S03E07,829
Says the guy who drove a car into our kitchen.,S03E07,830
Close your eyes.,S03E07,831
There you go.,S03E07,832
Okay.,S03E07,833

Watching TV!,S03E07,867
Yay!,S03E07,868
I want princesses.,S03E07,869
Really?,S03E07,870
"Uh, did Mommy promise you a Princess?",S03E07,871
"Mommy said, two princesses, please.",S03E07,872
"All right, you heard her, Princess.",S03E07,873
Make it happen.,S03E07,874
Mommy said two.,S03E07,875
Just breathe.,S03E07,876

"Yeah, because he's so good with cars?",S03E07,878
"Hey, sorry it took so long.",S03E07,879
You went for ice cream at a time like this?,S03E07,880
"Uh, well.",S03E07,881
"Actually, the ice cream came to me.",S03E07,882
You're taking me to the hospital in an ice cream truck?,S03E07,883
You said to flag down the first thing I saw.,S03E07,884
"Oh what's the matter, the giant hot dog wouldn't stop?",S03E07,885
Yeah.,S03E07,886
Okay.,S03E07,887
"Push, Teddy.",S03E07,888
"Welcome aboard Mustachio Pete's, the ice cream truck with the pistachio treats.",S03E07,889
"FYI, pistachio has been discontinued.",S03E07,890
"Bob, I need to lie down.",S03E07,891
-Okay.,S03E07,892
-You can use that bean bag chair.,S03E07,893
It's where Mustachio Pete takes his 10 minute breaks.,S03E07,894
Which Mustachio Pete is allowed by law.,S03E07,895
"You're not gonna keep referring to yourself in the third person, are you?",S03E07,896
"Yes, he is.",S03E07,897
That's Mustachio Pete's trademark.,S03E07,898
"That, and the pistachio, which, FYI.",S03E07,899
Has been discontinued.,S03E07,900
We get.,S03E07,901

"If things get bad back there, bite down on a rocket pop.",S03E07,905
"Ooh, cool, I will.",S03E07,906
He meant me!,S03E07,907
Can we get going? It's an emergency.,S03E07,908
Emergency?,S03E07,909
This calls for the fast-paced music.,S03E07,910
"Ready, Charlie?",S03E07,911
It's Princess time!,S03E07,912
I seem to have lost my sister Princess.,S03E07,913
Excuse me.,S03E07,914
-Get out there! -But I feel stupid!,S03E07,915
-You think I don't? -You're used to it!,S03E07,916
Go!,S03E07,917
"Dance, Princess.",S03E07,918
Left.,S03E07,919
And right.,S03E07,920
And we cast a spell.,S03E07,921
And we twirl and we twirl.,S03E07,922
And we curtsy!,S03E07,923
Look at that smile.,S03E07,924
We gotta go again.,S03E07,925

"But, this time, stay with me.",S03E07,927
"And five, six, seven, eight.",S03E07,928

"You're not helping yourself to any freebies back there, are you, Bob?",S03E07,935
"I'm a stress eater, Pete.",S03E07,936
You don't have to tell me about stress.,S03E07,937
The ice cream truck business is dog-eat-dog.,S03E07,938
I got Side Burn Sam nipping at my heels.,S03E07,939
"Could we just focus on the road, Pete?",S03E07,940
But both princesses are so beautiful.,S03E07,941
How could I ever choose just one to be my wife?,S03E07,942
"Dude, that's your line.",S03E07,943
"Oh, right.",S03E07,944
"Well, I guess there's only one way.",S03E07,945
See whose foot fits the magic slipper.,S03E07,946
Okay.,S03E07,947
'Tis not I whose foot doth fit the slipper.,S03E07,948
"Yes, tis not me, either.",S03E07,949
"But, sister Princess, you have not tried on the slipper.",S03E07,950
I doth not want to.,S03E07,951

"Okay, we're done!",S03E07,961
"Yeah, not quite.",S03E07,962
We're gonna go again from the top.,S03E07,963

"Honey, you just gotta help me.",S03E07,969
All alone back here! Just sayin'.,S03E07,970
Okay.,S03E07,971

"Okay, Teddy.",S03E07,976
Here we go.,S03E07,977
"Oh, wow.",S03E07,978
"Well, hello, number five.",S03E07,979
What a beautiful baby boy.,S03E07,980
Isn't he precious?,S03E07,981
We got here as fast as we could.,S03E07,982
Hi.,S03E07,983
There's the birthday girl.,S03E07,984
Happy Birthday.,S03E07,985
"Charlie, come here.",S03E07,986
Meet your new baby brother.,S03E07,987

"Well, we decided to call him.",S03E07,991
Toby.,S03E07,992

Nice.,S03E07,995
"Welcome to the world, Toby Duncan.",S03E07,996
"Hey, quick question.",S03E07,997
Why are you guys dressed like that?,S03E07,998
"Oh, because.",S03E07,999
Mom promised Charlie princesses for her party.,S03E07,1000
I never promised Charlie princesses.,S03E07,1001
"Charlie, did you trick us?",S03E07,1002
"Sweetie, did you get your special birthday present, Kuddle Me Katie?",S03E07,1003
"No, Mommy.",S03E07,1004
What? Why not?,S03E07,1005

PJ?,S03E07,1008
Teddy?,S03E07,1009
Gabe?,S03E07,1010
"Sweetie, I'm sorry.",S03E07,1011
"Wasn't much of a birthday, was it?",S03E07,1012
"That's okay, Mommy.",S03E07,1013
"Now, don't you worry.",S03E07,1014
We will get you your special present.,S03E07,1015
I like this present.,S03E07,1016
"Okay, listen up.",S03E07,1017
Here's the plan.,S03E07,1018
"So, when they come through the front door, you guys.",S03E07,1019
Are gonna hold up this banner.,S03E07,1020
Here.,S03E07,1021
Take that.,S03E07,1022
"And Charlie, you're gonna give Mommy these balloons.",S03E07,1023
And I'm gonna blow the noisemaker.,S03E07,1024
"And then we're all gonna sing welcome home, Toby",S03E07,1025
To the tune of the rock classic.,S03E07,1026
Our House.,S03E07,1027
Why do you get to blow the noisemaker?,S03E07,1028
And why are we making such a big deal outta this?,S03E07,1029
They bring a new baby home like every six months.,S03E07,1030
This is what we always do.,S03E07,1031
We did it for Charlie.,S03E07,1032
Did you do it for me?,S03E07,1033
Uh.,S03E07,1034
Yeah.,S03E07,1035
"-You're lying! -No, I'm not.",S03E07,1036
"Yeah, you are.",S03E07,1037
You.,S03E07,1038
"You know what? If you didn't do it for me, I'm not doing it for Toby.",S03E07,1039
No matter how cool his name is.,S03E07,1040
"Gabe, just pick up the stupid banner",S03E07,1041
and join in this very touching family celebration!,S03E07,1042
You can't make me.,S03E07,1043
"Well, if he's not gonna do it, I'm not gonna do it.",S03E07,1044
And if we not all gonna do it together.,S03E07,1045
 It looks like Charlie could have made it.,S03E07,1046
Good to be home.,S03E07,1047
"This is what it's all about, isn't it? Now I see.",S03E07,1048
So let me show you around.,S03E07,1049
"This is your home, Toby.",S03E07,1050

This is the living room.,S03E07,1052
And this is your family.,S03E07,1053
Tell me who's your angel.,S03E07,1054
"Who's your shoulder, to hold your boulders.",S03E07,1055
Tell me when it's raining.,S03E07,1056
Who will warm you.,S03E07,1057
Who will hold you.,S03E07,1058
You might be broken.,S03E07,1059
With all these cracks in your skin.,S03E07,1060
You might be broken that's where the light gets in.,S03E07,1061
"You're something beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.",S03E07,1062
"You're something beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.",S03E07,1063
And I just want you to know.,S03E07,1064
You to know.,S03E07,1065
You to know.,S03E07,1066
That you're not alone.,S03E07,1067
You're not alone.,S03E07,1068
"Hey, what you doing?",S03E07,1069
Giving Toby a proper welcome home.,S03E07,1070
"Well, Charlie, it's been kind of a big week.",S03E07,1071
"I uh, I helped deliver a baby.",S03E07,1072
"Our little brother, Toby.",S03E07,1073
And you finally got your Kuddle Me Katie.,S03E07,1074
Which you lost interest in five minutes after you got it.,S03E07,1075
"Doesn't matter, Gabe's still paying for it.",S03E07,1076
He worked out a little agreement with Mom and Dad.,S03E07,1077
Gabe! Diaper change!,S03E07,1078
And it's a doozy.,S03E07,1079
Coming.,S03E07,1080
"Wish him good luck, Charlie.",S03E07,1081
Isn't he adorable?,S03E07,1082

"Yup, your Dad's a big fan of the movies.",S03E07,1089
"Speaking of, where is Dad?",S03E07,1090
I'm ready to go home.,S03E07,1091
He said he was just going to pull the car up.,S03E07,1092
Here he is now.,S03E07,1093
Hey! Ready to go hun?,S03E07,1094
"Yes, babe how did you do that?",S03E07,1095
We're on the eighth floor.,S03E07,1096

Yeah.,S03E07,1098
Serenade!,S03E07,1099

Let's see how that baby's doing now.,S03E08.ass,5
I want you out!,S03E08.ass,6
Duncan kid number five is late.,S03E08.ass,7
And Duncan kid number two is getting on my nerves.,S03E08.ass,8
Moving on.,S03E08.ass,9
"Anyway, I'm hoping for a baby girl.",S03E08.ass,10
I'm hoping for a baby boy.,S03E08.ass,11
Yeah.,S03E08.ass,12
Me too.,S03E08.ass,13
I want a younger brother to pick on.,S03E08.ass,14
I'm tired of picking on my older brother.,S03E08.ass,15
"Oh, boy or girl doesn't matter to me.",S03E08.ass,16
"Whatever Mom wants, I want.",S03E08.ass,17
Don't touch me.,S03E08.ass,18
"Never again, honey.",S03E08.ass,19
Once again I've kept the camera on just a smidge too long.,S03E08.ass,20
"Guys, this is all just too much.",S03E08.ass,21
"The new baby's about to come, and Charlie's birthday tomorrow.",S03E08.ass,22
Just so long as they don't happen on the same day.,S03E08.ass,23
"-What do you mean? -Well, think about it.",S03E08.ass,24
Wouldn't it be kind of sad if Charlie had to,S03E08.ass,25
share her birthday with the new baby?,S03E08.ass,26
I'll tell you what's sad.,S03E08.ass,27
We're out of French Toast sticks.,S03E08.ass,28
"Teddy, honey, the baby's gonna come when the baby wants to come.",S03E08.ass,29
"But if it does happen to be tomorrow,",S03E08.ass,30
I need everyone to help out with Charlie's birthday.,S03E08.ass,31
"Mom, I'm willing to help out by doing what I always do.",S03E08.ass,32
You don't ever do anything.,S03E08.ass,33
And nobody does it better.,S03E08.ass,34
All I'm saying is if somebody goes to the trouble,S03E08.ass,35
"of inventing French Toast sticks, the least we could do is buy their product.",S03E08.ass,36
"Bob, honey, you took care of those things I asked you to handle, right?",S03E08.ass,37
I.,S03E08.ass,38
Certainly did.,S03E08.ass,39
Why was there a pause between I and certainly?,S03E08.ass,40
No pause.,S03E08.ass,41
Just my normal speaking.,S03E08.ass,42
Talk voice pattern.,S03E08.ass,43
"So, you bought the baby's new car seat,",S03E08.ass,44
and the doll Charlie wants for her birthday?,S03E08.ass,45
Honey.,S03E08.ass,46
I did it all.,S03E08.ass,47
Okay? Mission accomplished.,S03E08.ass,48
I.,S03E08.ass,49
Believe you.,S03E08.ass,50
"Uh, Gabe?",S03E08.ass,51
"-Yeah? -Listen, here is, uh.",S03E08.ass,52
Here's 50 bucks.,S03E08.ass,53
I need you to go down to the mall.,S03E08.ass,54
I need you to get that doll for Charlie.,S03E08.ass,55
"Dad, why can't you do it?",S03E08.ass,56
Because I gotta buy a car seat.,S03E08.ass,57
You know how some little girls grow up,S03E08.ass,58
and pick a husband who's just like their Daddy?,S03E08.ass,59
I'm gonna go a different way.,S03E08.ass,60
Today's all burnt toast ,S03E08.ass,61
"Running late, and dad jokes",S03E08.ass,62
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S03E08.ass,63
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S03E08.ass,64
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S03E08.ass,65
There it is up on the roof,S03E08.ass,66
"I've been there, I've survived",S03E08.ass,67
So just take my advice,S03E08.ass,68
"Hang in there, baby",S03E08.ass,69
Things are crazy,S03E08.ass,70
But I know your future's bright,S03E08.ass,71
"Hang in there, baby",S03E08.ass,72
There's no maybe,S03E08.ass,73
Everything turns out all right,S03E08.ass,74
Your life is up and down,S03E08.ass,75
But trust me it comes back around,S03E08.ass,76
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S03E08.ass,77
"Hang in there, baby.",S03E08.ass,78
"Hey, honey?",S03E08.ass,79
"Hey, come on.",S03E08.ass,80
There's something I want to show you.,S03E08.ass,81
"Honey, come on.",S03E08.ass,82
I'm moving as fast as I can.,S03E08.ass,83
Wide load coming through.,S03E08.ass,84
Look.,S03E08.ass,85
Look.,S03E08.ass,86
New car seat is in.,S03E08.ass,87
-Good.,S03E08.ass,88
-Yeah.,S03E08.ass,89
Bought it three days ago.,S03E08.ass,90
"Well, whatever.",S03E08.ass,91
Looks a little crowded in here.,S03E08.ass,92
"Well, honey, we're gonna be up front. Who cares what happens in the back?",S03E08.ass,93
"Bob, I don't think there's enough room.",S03E08.ass,94
Sure there is.,S03E08.ass,95
"No, Bob, with five kids, I think we might need a new car.",S03E08.ass,96
Slow down.,S03E08.ass,97
"No, no, no, no, no.",S03E08.ass,98
Enough room in here for everybody.,S03E08.ass,99
"Look, Charlie sits here, new baby over there,",S03E08.ass,100
"one kid back there, the other over there.",S03E08.ass,101
Done.,S03E08.ass,102
Problem solved.,S03E08.ass,103
You forgot a kid.,S03E08.ass,104
Which one?,S03E08.ass,105
I don't know.,S03E08.ass,106
But I know there are five.,S03E08.ass,107
This can work.,S03E08.ass,108
Let me show you.,S03E08.ass,109
Kids!.,S03E08.ass,110
"There, see?",S03E08.ass,111
Piece of cake.,S03E08.ass,112
How's everybody doing back there?,S03E08.ass,113
PJ keeps poking me with his rib.,S03E08.ass,114
It's called breathing.,S03E08.ass,115
"Honey, Gabe doesn't have a seat belt.",S03E08.ass,116
Or a seat.,S03E08.ass,117
He'll be fine.,S03E08.ass,118
"Hey, Charlie?",S03E08.ass,119
Are you comfortable?,S03E08.ass,120
No.,S03E08.ass,121
-Bob? -Yes?,S03E08.ass,122
-New car? -New car.,S03E08.ass,123
Okay.,S03E08.ass,124
Here we go.,S03E08.ass,125
Oh.,S03E08.ass,126
"Hey, Mom? Oh.",S03E08.ass,127
What are you doing?,S03E08.ass,128
Painting my toenails.,S03E08.ass,129
Just because I can't see them doesn't mean they shouldn't look good.,S03E08.ass,130
Oh.,S03E08.ass,131
"Well in that case, you might want to consider clipping them.",S03E08.ass,132
Can I help you?,S03E08.ass,133
"Well, I am actually here to help you.",S03E08.ass,134
"So, Mom, I know that you've been very anxious",S03E08.ass,135
"to get this baby out, so I went online",S03E08.ass,136
and I looked up some natural ways to induce labor.,S03E08.ass,137
"Ooh, like what?",S03E08.ass,138
"Well, uh, there's a bunch of techniques, but the first one includes.",S03E08.ass,139
Boo!,S03E08.ass,140
What was that?,S03E08.ass,141
I was trying to scare the baby out.,S03E08.ass,142
"Well, it didn't work.",S03E08.ass,143
Okay.,S03E08.ass,144
"Fine, well, there's always some other stuff we can try, like.",S03E08.ass,145
Boo!,S03E08.ass,146
Stop that.,S03E08.ass,147
"Okay, you know, it's a baby.",S03E08.ass,148
It's not the hiccups.,S03E08.ass,149
"So, what do you want to do today?",S03E08.ass,150
"Well, it's a beautiful day.",S03E08.ass,151
"Sun shining, the birds are chirping.",S03E08.ass,152
"So, video games in the basement?",S03E08.ass,153
"Dude, you had me scared there for a minute with all the outdoor talk.",S03E08.ass,154
"All right, let's go.",S03E08.ass,155
Wait.,S03E08.ass,156
I promised my Dad I'd go to the store and buy Charlie a stupid doll.,S03E08.ass,157
And I told my Mom I was at the library.,S03E08.ass,158
So what?,S03E08.ass,159
"No, Jake, I really have to go do this.",S03E08.ass,160
"So, who's stopping you?",S03E08.ass,161
I'll wait right here.,S03E08.ass,162
"Yeah, you know I'm not allowed to leave you in this house alone.",S03E08.ass,163
Come on.,S03E08.ass,164
"Man, you take one bubble bath, you get labeled.",S03E08.ass,165
What's all this?,S03E08.ass,166
I got us some yoga balls.,S03E08.ass,167
Another way to induce labor is through bouncing.,S03E08.ass,168
"All right, I'll try anything.",S03E08.ass,169
"Hit it, Charlie.",S03E08.ass,170
Feel anything?,S03E08.ass,171
I feel silly.,S03E08.ass,172
You look silly.,S03E08.ass,173
Oh.,S03E08.ass,174
"Teddy, this isn't going to work.",S03E08.ass,175
Do it again.,S03E08.ass,176
"Dude, I can't be seen doll shopping.",S03E08.ass,177
I'll lose my street cred.,S03E08.ass,178
"Yeah, I think you lost that when you started giggling in the bra Department.",S03E08.ass,179
Let's just buy this thing and get out of here.,S03E08.ass,180
Kuddle Me Katie?,S03E08.ass,181
That's stupid.,S03E08.ass,182
Goo-goo.,S03E08.ass,183
It said goo-goo.,S03E08.ass,184
"Whoa, look what they just released.",S03E08.ass,185
Attack of the Zartians.,S03E08.ass,186
"Oh, right.",S03E08.ass,187
I heard about this game.,S03E08.ass,188
Zartians are martians that were bitten by zombies.,S03E08.ass,189
Ewe.,S03E08.ass,190
That's disgusting.,S03E08.ass,191
"What are they covered in, blood or puke?",S03E08.ass,192
Hopefully both.,S03E08.ass,193
Let's get it.,S03E08.ass,194
It's 50 bucks.,S03E08.ass,195
I don't have 50 bucks.,S03E08.ass,196
"Yeah, you do.",S03E08.ass,197
Wait a minute.,S03E08.ass,198
-Are you.,S03E08.ass,199
Are you saying.,S03E08.ass,200
-That's exactly what I'm saying.,S03E08.ass,201
You're gonna buy this game with the doll money.,S03E08.ass,202
Yeah.,S03E08.ass,203
-And then what? -We play it.,S03E08.ass,204
-After we play it? -We play it again.,S03E08.ass,205
"Well, what about Charlie's doll?",S03E08.ass,206
I promised my Dad.,S03E08.ass,207
"Dude, we're teenagers now.",S03E08.ass,208
We're supposed to be rebels.,S03E08.ass,209
Your Mom still picks out your underwear.,S03E08.ass,210
And sometimes I wear it backwards.,S03E08.ass,211
On purpose.,S03E08.ass,212
"You know what? I'm gonna buy this game,",S03E08.ass,213
but just so we can stop talking about your underwear.,S03E08.ass,214
"Hey, Mom.",S03E08.ass,215
How you doing?,S03E08.ass,216
"I am tired, bloated, cranky, I have never been more miserable in my life.",S03E08.ass,217
That's nice.,S03E08.ass,218
Hey.,S03E08.ass,219
I just did a quick freezer check.,S03E08.ass,220
Still not seeing the French Toast sticks.,S03E08.ass,221
I bought you some.,S03E08.ass,222
"Yeah, you bought French Toast squares.",S03E08.ass,223
"Well, if you want sticks, then just take the squares and cut them in half.",S03E08.ass,224
Cut them in half?,S03E08.ass,225
But then you cut the fun in half.,S03E08.ass,226
"Honey, you'll figure it out.",S03E08.ass,227
I guess I could take the cut squares.,S03E08.ass,228
And glue them together lengthwise with syrup.,S03E08.ass,229
Or would jam make a better adhesive?,S03E08.ass,230
I'd better nap on it.,S03E08.ass,231
"That's your big brother, PJ.",S03E08.ass,232
He's not the smartest.,S03E08.ass,233
That's it.,S03E08.ass,234
"Hey, Mom. You hungry?",S03E08.ass,235
"Oh, no.",S03E08.ass,236
"Honey, I couldn't eat anything.",S03E08.ass,237
"I'm so big, I just.",S03E08.ass,238
I just.,S03E08.ass,239
What you got?,S03E08.ass,240
Vindaloo Pepper Curry from the new Indian place.,S03E08.ass,241
Because I read that another way to induce labor is with spicy food.,S03E08.ass,242
Is it really that spicy?,S03E08.ass,243
"Yeah, so spicy, they made me sign a waiver.",S03E08.ass,244
And attend a brief seminar.,S03E08.ass,245
Let's try it.,S03E08.ass,246
Dad!,S03E08.ass,247
"I set that down, like, one minute ago.",S03E08.ass,248
Stuff's got some kick to it.,S03E08.ass,249
What else you got?,S03E08.ass,250
"So, uh, how is belly dancing supposed to help?",S03E08.ass,251
"Well, they say that it's good to exercise your core, and.",S03E08.ass,252
"Let's face it, right now.",S03E08.ass,253
You're all core.,S03E08.ass,254
Oh.,S03E08.ass,255
"Check it out, this is fun.",S03E08.ass,256
"And surprise, surprise.",S03E08.ass,257
I'm good at it.,S03E08.ass,258
"Feel anything, Mom?",S03E08.ass,259
Feel like I'm kicking your butt at belly dancing.,S03E08.ass,260
"-Oh, no, you're not.",S03E08.ass,261
"-Oh, yes, I am.",S03E08.ass,262
-Bring it.,S03E08.ass,263
-Consider it brung.,S03E08.ass,264
-Oh! -Yeah!,S03E08.ass,265
"Yeah, you just got served.",S03E08.ass,266
"In a bowl, with a spoon.",S03E08.ass,267
Didn't realize belly dancing had so much trash talk.,S03E08.ass,268
"Man, this is frustrating.",S03E08.ass,269
"Yeah, I know.",S03E08.ass,270
They really need to make bigger keyboards,S03E08.ass,271
"for people with big, sausage-y fingers.",S03E08.ass,272
What are you talking about?,S03E08.ass,273
What are you talking about?,S03E08.ass,274
I'm trying to figure out what kind of car to buy.,S03E08.ass,275
"Problem is, you got too many choices.",S03E08.ass,276
And then you gotta figure out.,S03E08.ass,277
Mileage and.,S03E08.ass,278
"Color, safety, reliability.",S03E08.ass,279
You know what? This is impossible.,S03E08.ass,280
"Well, what about this one?",S03E08.ass,281
"I mean, look how happy it's making that family.",S03E08.ass,282
"Oh, and they're going across the country.",S03E08.ass,283
Mount Rushmore.,S03E08.ass,284
The Grand Canyon.,S03E08.ass,285
Grandma's house.,S03E08.ass,286
PJ.,S03E08.ass,287
"Come on, it's just a commercial, you.",S03E08.ass,288
"Hey, they brought her a puppy.",S03E08.ass,289
"Oh, it's just what she wanted.",S03E08.ass,290
We have to get that car.,S03E08.ass,291
If we want to be happy.,S03E08.ass,292
"Okay, how is a salad going to help me go into labor?",S03E08.ass,293
"Not the salad, the dressing.",S03E08.ass,294
"See, this place is famous for it.",S03E08.ass,295
They have this special secret ingredient that just pops a kid right out.,S03E08.ass,296
It's worth a shot.,S03E08.ass,297
"Besides, I haven't eaten in like, 15 minutes.",S03E08.ass,298
Hi. Can I help you?,S03E08.ass,299
Yes.,S03E08.ass,300
"A table for two, please.",S03E08.ass,301
"Sure, can I get your name? We have about a three-hour wait.",S03E08.ass,302
Three hours?,S03E08.ass,303
But we need a table right away.,S03E08.ass,304
"Yes, I'm pregnant.",S03E08.ass,305
It's kind of a special circumstance.,S03E08.ass,306
"Oh, well, in that case, you can wait in our special section.",S03E08.ass,307
This is ridiculous.,S03E08.ass,308
I can't believe they're making us stand here like this.,S03E08.ass,309
I'm seven days overdue.,S03E08.ass,310
Seven days?,S03E08.ass,311
Try nine days on for size.,S03E08.ass,312
I'm looking back at seven days like it was a party.,S03E08.ass,313
"Oh, yeah?",S03E08.ass,314
I have enough gas to fly to London.,S03E08.ass,315
Try China.,S03E08.ass,316
How's that table coming?,S03E08.ass,317
-All right.,S03E08.ass,318
-I can't wait to play this game.,S03E08.ass,319
"Yeah, I was getting that from the way you opened the box with your teeth.",S03E08.ass,320
That's how I open everything.,S03E08.ass,321
Why do you think I need braces?,S03E08.ass,322
"Now, if my Dad comes down.",S03E08.ass,323
"And asks where the doll is, what am I gonna tell him?",S03E08.ass,324
"Okay, I got it.",S03E08.ass,325
I'll tell him that.,S03E08.ass,326
"On the way to the toy store, I got beat up by a gang.",S03E08.ass,327
And.,S03E08.ass,328
They stole the money and I'm lucky to be alive.,S03E08.ass,329
"Dude, it's your Dad we're talking about.",S03E08.ass,330
Why are you working so hard on a story?,S03E08.ass,331
You know what?,S03E08.ass,332
You're right.,S03E08.ass,333
Why am I worried about Charlie's stupid doll anyway?,S03E08.ass,334
"All right, here.",S03E08.ass,335
Uh-oh. What's that?,S03E08.ass,336
Warning.,S03E08.ass,337
Contains scenes of graphic violence.,S03E08.ass,338
Parental supervision strongly advised.,S03E08.ass,339
Yes!,S03E08.ass,340
"Well, I retain so much water, I slosh when I walk.",S03E08.ass,341
I slosh when I sleep.,S03E08.ass,342
"Oh, you sleep?",S03E08.ass,343
"Oh, Mom.",S03E08.ass,344
I just thought of a great idea.,S03E08.ass,345
Why don't we get the salads to go?,S03E08.ass,346
Don't you think we thought of that?,S03E08.ass,347
They don't do takeout here.,S03E08.ass,348
Sure hope your next kid is smarter than this one.,S03E08.ass,349
Hey.,S03E08.ass,350
Nobody insults my kids but me.,S03E08.ass,351
You want a piece of me?,S03E08.ass,352
"-You want a piece of me? -Okay! Ladies, let's break it up.",S03E08.ass,353
"Let's just go, okay? I can't do this for three hours.",S03E08.ass,354
"What? No, Mom.",S03E08.ass,355
We have to stick it out.,S03E08.ass,356
The baby has to be born today.,S03E08.ass,357
Tomorrow's Charlie's birthday.,S03E08.ass,358
"Honey, I know that.",S03E08.ass,359
But we're out of options here.,S03E08.ass,360
Or are we?,S03E08.ass,361
Look over there.,S03E08.ass,362
That must be the salad dressing.,S03E08.ass,363
"Okay, so you create a distraction for everyone, and I'll go get it.",S03E08.ass,364
We're going to steal salad dressing?,S03E08.ass,365
The student becomes the master.,S03E08.ass,366
Oh my!,S03E08.ass,367
Oh my! It's happening.,S03E08.ass,368
"Oh, Mama's having a baby child!",S03E08.ass,369
"Okay, just stay calm.",S03E08.ass,370
Everything's gonna be okay.,S03E08.ass,371
-Okay.,S03E08.ass,372
-Just breathe.,S03E08.ass,373
"Oh, you know what?",S03E08.ass,374
False alarm.,S03E08.ass,375
Sorry.,S03E08.ass,376
"Everybody go back to your salads, nothing more to see here.",S03E08.ass,377
Oh.,S03E08.ass,378
Let's get out of here.,S03E08.ass,379
"Hey! Stop them, they've got the dressing.",S03E08.ass,380
Run for it!,S03E08.ass,381
Oh.,S03E08.ass,382
Okay.,S03E08.ass,383
"Hey, everybody relax.",S03E08.ass,384
"Yeah, no need to get crazy, okay, there's plenty of dressing for everyone.",S03E08.ass,385
I am having twins.,S03E08.ass,386
I want double.,S03E08.ass,387
"Oh, yeah? I'm gonna need to see an ultrasound.",S03E08.ass,388
"Hey, hey! Back off.",S03E08.ass,389
One more step and the dressing gets it.,S03E08.ass,390
That's right.,S03E08.ass,391
You heard her.,S03E08.ass,392
Now everyone waddle away real nice-like.,S03E08.ass,393
"You first, twinsie.",S03E08.ass,394
"So, Bob.",S03E08.ass,395
What got you interested in the Serenade?,S03E08.ass,396
"Well, the mileage, safety, reliability.",S03E08.ass,397
Was it the puppy?,S03E08.ass,398
Yeah.,S03E08.ass,399
"So, what do you think?",S03E08.ass,400
"Rides pretty smooth, doesn't it?",S03E08.ass,401
"Yeah, it's.",S03E08.ass,402
"It's okay, I guess.",S03E08.ass,403
Are you kidding?,S03E08.ass,404
I feel like I'm floating on a cloud.,S03E08.ass,405
A cloud with seat warmers.,S03E08.ass,406
So that's why I'm so toasty down there.,S03E08.ass,407
Sounds like your boy likes the car.,S03E08.ass,408
Six cup holders?!,S03E08.ass,409
Serenade! Serenade!,S03E08.ass,410
Serenade!,S03E08.ass,411
"What do you say, Bob?",S03E08.ass,412
You want to go inside and we'll crunch some numbers?,S03E08.ass,413
Um.,S03E08.ass,414
"Could you give us a minute, Stu?.",S03E08.ass,415
Sure thing.,S03E08.ass,416
I'll be in the showroom.,S03E08.ass,417
PJ!,S03E08.ass,418
What are you doing? You're blowing the whole deal!,S03E08.ass,419
What do you mean?,S03E08.ass,420
"If Stu thinks we like the car, we're gonna have to pay more for it.",S03E08.ass,421
We gotta make him think we don't want the car.,S03E08.ass,422
So there's a chance we won't buy it?,S03E08.ass,423
Are you kidding me? I love this thing!,S03E08.ass,424
Serenade! Serenade! Serenade!,S03E08.ass,425
Never knew pregnant women could be so vicious.,S03E08.ass,426
It was horrifying.,S03E08.ass,427
That one gal chewed off a couple of my buttons.,S03E08.ass,428
Why don't we go downstairs again and try bouncing.,S03E08.ass,429
"Oh, no, no, no, no.",S03E08.ass,430
"Sweetie, we are done.",S03E08.ass,431
"Okay, we've tried everything.",S03E08.ass,432
This baby is gonna come when it wants to.,S03E08.ass,433
I guess you're right.,S03E08.ass,434
"And if it is born on Charlie's birthday,",S03E08.ass,435
maybe that wouldn't be such a bad thing.,S03E08.ass,436
What do you mean?,S03E08.ass,437
"Well, I don't know, with.",S03E08.ass,438
"Five kids, maybe it wouldn't hurt to double up on birthdays.",S03E08.ass,439
You know.,S03E08.ass,440
"Less parties, less presents, less headaches.",S03E08.ass,441
Hey.,S03E08.ass,442
Maybe I can tell Charlie and the baby they were born on December 25.,S03E08.ass,443
"So, follow my lead.",S03E08.ass,444
Play it cool.,S03E08.ass,445
"Oh, and whatever happens, don't get too overenthusiastic.",S03E08.ass,446
"Don't worry about me, big guy.",S03E08.ass,447
I will be cool with a capital K.,S03E08.ass,448
And don't do any spelling.,S03E08.ass,449
Check.,S03E08.ass,450
"Have a seat, fellas.",S03E08.ass,451
In these chairs?,S03E08.ass,452
Forget it.,S03E08.ass,453
They're pieces of junk.,S03E08.ass,454
We're not buying the chairs.,S03E08.ass,455
Darn right we're not.,S03E08.ass,456
It's not even that fun.,S03E08.ass,457
"So, what do you think, Bob?",S03E08.ass,458
Will you be driving home in a Serenade today?,S03E08.ass,459
"Well, uh.",S03E08.ass,460
"I don't know, Stu.",S03E08.ass,461
"I guess it, uh, depends on what you can do for me.",S03E08.ass,462
"Yeah, Stu. What have you got?",S03E08.ass,463
Bring it.,S03E08.ass,464
Does this price work for you?,S03E08.ass,465
Does.,S03E08.ass,466
This work for you?.,S03E08.ass,467
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. PJ, PJ?",S03E08.ass,468
We actually have to look at the offers.,S03E08.ass,469
"Amateur move, but go ahead.",S03E08.ass,470
"Look, Bob.",S03E08.ass,471
I want to make you happy.,S03E08.ass,472
What do you think about this?,S03E08.ass,473
This is your offer?,S03E08.ass,474
PJ.,S03E08.ass,475
"This is your beef, Stu?",S03E08.ass,476
Get it? Beef Stu?,S03E08.ass,477
"-Yeah, we.",S03E08.ass,478
We all got it.,S03E08.ass,479
-Yeah.,S03E08.ass,480
"Come on, Dad.",S03E08.ass,481
We are out of here.,S03E08.ass,482
Dad? You coming?,S03E08.ass,483
"I, uh.",S03E08.ass,484
"Chose the wrong child to come with me today, Stu.",S03E08.ass,485
I.,S03E08.ass,486
I apologize.,S03E08.ass,487
How long have we been playing?,S03E08.ass,488
Six hours.,S03E08.ass,489
My eyes are burning.,S03E08.ass,490
You should blink once in a while.,S03E08.ass,491
That's exactly what they want.,S03E08.ass,492
"Who are you working for, the Zartian King?",S03E08.ass,493
"Easy, dude.",S03E08.ass,494
Your phone's ringing again.,S03E08.ass,495
It's just my Mom wondering where I am.,S03E08.ass,496
Off to voice mail.,S03E08.ass,497
I'm gonna go down this alley and check for mutants.,S03E08.ass,498
Cover me.,S03E08.ass,499
"You having fun, Gabe?",S03E08.ass,500
Whoa.,S03E08.ass,501
Did you see that?,S03E08.ass,502
What?,S03E08.ass,503
My Dad.,S03E08.ass,504
He was.,S03E08.ass,505
He was in the game and he was talking to me.,S03E08.ass,506
That's normal.,S03E08.ass,507
"After six hours, you're gonna hallucinate.",S03E08.ass,508
Really?,S03E08.ass,509
Yeah.,S03E08.ass,510
It was a warning on the box.,S03E08.ass,511
You've just got to power through it.,S03E08.ass,512
Okay.,S03E08.ass,513
You're right.,S03E08.ass,514
Just got to focus.,S03E08.ass,515
We got to get that level nine monster.,S03E08.ass,516
It's your baby sister's birthday.,S03E08.ass,517
All she wanted was a doll.,S03E08.ass,518
Maybe you're the monster.,S03E08.ass,519
Ah!,S03E08.ass,520
What are you doing?,S03E08.ass,521
We're done.,S03E08.ass,522
And tomorrow we're taking the game back and getting Charlie her doll.,S03E08.ass,523
What's wrong with your hands?,S03E08.ass,524
I don't know.,S03E08.ass,525
Help me.,S03E08.ass,526
"Oh, happy first birthday, you adorable baby.",S03E08.ass,527
Look at that smile.,S03E08.ass,528
Check out those cheeks.,S03E08.ass,529
I could just eat you up.,S03E08.ass,530
You are the cutest baby ever.,S03E08.ass,531
"Yes, you are.",S03E08.ass,532
"It's my birthday, too.",S03E08.ass,533
"Oh, and Daddy loves you.",S03E08.ass,534
"That's right, Daddy lu-lu you.",S03E08.ass,535
I'm sad.,S03E08.ass,536
"Oh, my little angel.",S03E08.ass,537
I could never forget you.,S03E08.ass,538
"I'll never forget you either, baby.",S03E08.ass,539
Not you.,S03E08.ass,540
Teddy.,S03E08.ass,541
"Morning, Mom.",S03E08.ass,542
"Teddy, I can't have this baby today.",S03E08.ass,543
Charlie needs to have her special birthday.,S03E08.ass,544
That's what I've been saying all along.,S03E08.ass,545
"Yeah, but now I'm saying it.",S03E08.ass,546
"Okay, well, what made you change your mind?",S03E08.ass,547
I had this horrible dream last night.,S03E08.ass,548
The entire family was just being so mean to Charlie.,S03E08.ass,549
Ignoring her.,S03E08.ass,550
Even you.,S03E08.ass,551
What were you doing in the dream?,S03E08.ass,552
I was doing what I always do.,S03E08.ass,553
Fighting bravely to make things right.,S03E08.ass,554
"Okay, look, the point is I can't have the baby today.",S03E08.ass,555
Charlie needs her special day.,S03E08.ass,556
"All right, well, however you got here, I totally agree.",S03E08.ass,557
We'll just make sure that you don't have the baby until tomorrow.,S03E08.ass,558
Exactly.,S03E08.ass,559
Okay.,S03E08.ass,560
"Okay, operation get baby out.",S03E08.ass,561
Has officially become operation keep baby in.,S03E08.ass,562
"I need complete rest and relaxation, okay?",S03E08.ass,563
Nothing but peace.,S03E08.ass,564
Calm.,S03E08.ass,565
And quiet.,S03E08.ass,566
"Morning, honey.",S03E08.ass,567
I said quiet!,S03E08.ass,568
Yeah.,S03E08.ass,569
Another day in paradise.,S03E08.ass,570
Next.,S03E08.ass,571
"Hi, we'd like to return this game, please.",S03E08.ass,572
Has it been opened?,S03E08.ass,573
Nope.,S03E08.ass,574
Then why is it covered in tape and what appears to be teeth marks?,S03E08.ass,575
Okay.,S03E08.ass,576
I'm gonna level with you.,S03E08.ass,577
We bought this game by accident.,S03E08.ass,578
"And then, Jake here.",S03E08.ass,579
Accidentally opened it.,S03E08.ass,580
And then we accidentally played it for six hours.,S03E08.ass,581
"Guys, I'm sorry, you can't return this.",S03E08.ass,582
"Oh, no, we don't want to return it.",S03E08.ass,583
We want to exchange it.,S03E08.ass,584
For money.,S03E08.ass,585
Next.,S03E08.ass,586
"Oh, this is bad.",S03E08.ass,587
What am I gonna do?,S03E08.ass,588
Only thing you can do.,S03E08.ass,589
You gotta steal the doll.,S03E08.ass,590
Steal the doll? But that's wrong.,S03E08.ass,591
"Well, exactly.",S03E08.ass,592
"You know the old saying, two wrongs make a right.",S03E08.ass,593
"No, it's two wrongs don't make a right.",S03E08.ass,594
Oh.,S03E08.ass,595
"Well, then, you know the other old saying.",S03E08.ass,596
Sometimes you gotta steal a doll.,S03E08.ass,597
I'm not gonna steal the doll.,S03E08.ass,598
"Well, can we at least steal candy?",S03E08.ass,599
No.,S03E08.ass,600
Then what's the point of even going to the store?,S03E08.ass,601
Serenade!,S03E08.ass,602
Serenade!,S03E08.ass,603
Serenade!,S03E08.ass,604
Yeah.,S03E08.ass,605
Oh.,S03E08.ass,606
Well.,S03E08.ass,607
Hope you learned something from the whole car-buying experience.,S03E08.ass,608
"Sure did, Dad.",S03E08.ass,609
"What's that, son?",S03E08.ass,610
"Can't we just leave it at a sure did, Dad?",S03E08.ass,611
I'm talking about the negotiation.,S03E08.ass,612
Look.,S03E08.ass,613
Someday you're gonna have a family of your own.,S03E08.ass,614
And you're gonna have to buy a new car.,S03E08.ass,615
And you know what you're gonna say to your kid?,S03E08.ass,616
The car doesn't fit in the garage?,S03E08.ass,617
What?,S03E08.ass,618
"Then I'll say, it's not my fault, son.",S03E08.ass,619
I learned all this from your grandpa Bob.,S03E08.ass,620
"And he'll say, oh, that explains it.",S03E08.ass,621
Then we'll laugh and get ice cream.,S03E08.ass,622
"Well, you asked.",S03E08.ass,623
Then everybody was being really mean to you.,S03E08.ass,624
"But don't you worry, I did what I always do.",S03E08.ass,625
Fought bravely to make things right.,S03E08.ass,626
"Charlie, you have the best Mommy in the world.",S03E08.ass,627
Even in a dream.,S03E08.ass,628
Charlie?,S03E08.ass,629
I made you a special birthday lunch.,S03E08.ass,630
It's in the kitchen.,S03E08.ass,631
Let's go get it.,S03E08.ass,632
Yay.,S03E08.ass,633
"Okay, um, Mom.",S03E08.ass,634
I was just wondering about Charlie's birthday party.,S03E08.ass,635
"Oh, honey.",S03E08.ass,636
I have to rest.,S03E08.ass,637
Would you please take care of that for me?,S03E08.ass,638
"Yeah, I got it.",S03E08.ass,639
Everything you need to know is in a file in the kitchen.,S03E08.ass,640
Got it.,S03E08.ass,641
"Teddy, you have really been there for me, and I just.",S03E08.ass,642
"I'm just so thankful, and.",S03E08.ass,643
You're my rock.,S03E08.ass,644
I don't know what I'd do without you.,S03E08.ass,645
Yeah.,S03E08.ass,646
"How are the hormones, Mom?",S03E08.ass,647
All over the place.,S03E08.ass,648
"Charlie, how'd you like your special pony-shaped sandwich?",S03E08.ass,649
All right.,S03E08.ass,650
Well.,S03E08.ass,651
Glad I spent an hour cutting it out.,S03E08.ass,652
Party folder.,S03E08.ass,653
"Hey, Charlie, come with me.",S03E08.ass,654
Ready? Oh! I got cha.,S03E08.ass,655
Okay.,S03E08.ass,656
What?,S03E08.ass,657
Mom forgot to mail the invitations?,S03E08.ass,658
Do you know what this means?,S03E08.ass,659
No.,S03E08.ass,660
Good.,S03E08.ass,661
You wait here.,S03E08.ass,662
I'll be right back.,S03E08.ass,663
"Dad, hi.",S03E08.ass,664
Okay.,S03E08.ass,665
Big problem.,S03E08.ass,666
So you know how Mom's been kinda spacey with the pregnancy?.,S03E08.ass,667
"Well, she forgot to plan Charlie's birthday party.",S03E08.ass,668
You think you got problems?,S03E08.ass,669
The garage is 31 inches too short.,S03E08.ass,670
"Oh, the garage is too short?",S03E08.ass,671
Now it's the garage's fault?,S03E08.ass,672
"Yeah, car-buying expert here didn't measure the.",S03E08.ass,673
She doesn't need to know the details.,S03E08.ass,674
She has her own situation.,S03E08.ass,675
"Didn't you hear? Mom made a big, dumb mistake.",S03E08.ass,676
"Well, so what.",S03E08.ass,677
What am I gonna do?.,S03E08.ass,678
Charlie's in there waiting for her party.,S03E08.ass,679
"Okay, all right.",S03E08.ass,680
"Give me, uh.",S03E08.ass,681
Give me a minute to think.,S03E08.ass,682
"Uh, bu.",S03E08.ass,683
Bu.,S03E08.ass,684

Okay.,S03E08.ass,687
Give me another minute.,S03E08.ass,688
"Well, I.",S03E08.ass,689
I guess I could try calling some of Charlie's friends.,S03E08.ass,690
See if they can come over.,S03E08.ass,691
Pick up a cake at the store.,S03E08.ass,692
Before you buy the cake.,S03E08.ass,693
You might wanna measure the fridge.,S03E08.ass,694
"Know what I'm saying, Dad?",S03E08.ass,695
"Hi uh, Mrs.",S03E08.ass,696
"Dickson, it's Teddy Duncan calling.",S03E08.ass,697

and I was just wondering if Megan could come.,S03E08.ass,700
Oh.,S03E08.ass,701
Chicken pox.,S03E08.ass,702
Poor little thing.,S03E08.ass,703
"But, you know, she doesn't have to stay for long.",S03E08.ass,704
Okay.,S03E08.ass,705
"Okay, I understand.",S03E08.ass,706
"Oh, you know what?",S03E08.ass,707
As long as I've got you.,S03E08.ass,708
Is there any chance that Mr.,S03E08.ass,709
Dickson is a.,S03E08.ass,710
"Is a clown or a magician, or.",S03E08.ass,711
Hello?,S03E08.ass,712
"Hi um, is this Cake World?",S03E08.ass,713
"Yeah, yeah, hi.",S03E08.ass,714
I need a cake.,S03E08.ass,715
Um.,S03E08.ass,716
You're out of cake?,S03E08.ass,717
You realize you're called Cake World.,S03E08.ass,718
"Which means, right now, you're just world.",S03E08.ass,719
"Yeah, well, I don't like your attitude, either.",S03E08.ass,720
Hello?,S03E08.ass,721

What's the most amazing animal you've got?,S03E08.ass,726
A monkey who does tricks for cake.,S03E08.ass,727
"Yeah, we're gonna have a problem.",S03E08.ass,728
"Um, by any chance.",S03E08.ass,729
Does the monkey come with its own cake?,S03E08.ass,730
Hello?,S03E08.ass,731
Who's coming to my party?,S03E08.ass,732
"You know, I'm really not sure.",S03E08.ass,733
"Hey, you know who might be fun to have at your party?",S03E08.ass,734
Who?,S03E08.ass,735
The kids from the playground.,S03E08.ass,736
Yay!,S03E08.ass,737
What kids?,S03E08.ass,738
"Well, we won't know until we get there.",S03E08.ass,739
Yay!,S03E08.ass,740
"Okay, that's as far as I can go.",S03E08.ass,741
How's she looking?,S03E08.ass,742
It's a she?,S03E08.ass,743
How can you tell?,S03E08.ass,744
Could you just press the button?,S03E08.ass,745
"All right, here it goes.",S03E08.ass,746
Looking good.,S03E08.ass,747
Looking good.,S03E08.ass,748
So close.,S03E08.ass,749
PJ was right.,S03E08.ass,750
The squares aren't as much fun as the sticks.,S03E08.ass,751
But I'm gonna eat some more anyway.,S03E08.ass,752
"So, what are you gonna do?",S03E08.ass,753
"Well, what choice do I have? I have to tell my Dad the truth.",S03E08.ass,754
"The truth? Dude, that game messed you up.",S03E08.ass,755
"You know, if you came in and shared some of the blame,",S03E08.ass,756
they'd probably go easier on me.,S03E08.ass,757
Guess we'll never know.,S03E08.ass,758
Gotta admit.,S03E08.ass,759
I like that kid's style.,S03E08.ass,760
"Okay, you.",S03E08.ass,761
You stay right where you are.,S03E08.ass,762
Little more. Stop!,S03E08.ass,763

"It looks bad from this side, too.",S03E08.ass,779
"Dad, I have to tell you some.",S03E08.ass,780
It can wait.,S03E08.ass,781

Garage door closes.,S03E08.ass,784
"Guys, Charlie's birthday party is.",S03E08.ass,785
Not our biggest problem.,S03E08.ass,786
"Why do you keep saying, uh-oh?",S03E08.ass,787
Why do you think?,S03E08.ass,788
The baby's coming.,S03E08.ass,789
"-Oh! -Okay, all right.",S03E08.ass,790
We gotta get Mom to the hospital.,S03E08.ass,791

"Oh, why do we always get the hard things?",S03E08.ass,808
You know.,S03E08.ass,809
I always thought you would be the first one to drive a car into the kitchen.,S03E08.ass,810
"Me, too.",S03E08.ass,811
"Hey, how you doing, honey?",S03E08.ass,812
It'd be a lot better if you were quiet!,S03E08.ass,813
She wants me to be quiet.,S03E08.ass,814
Gotta be quiet. Why can't I be quiet?,S03E08.ass,815
"Dad, were you this panicky when the rest of us were born?",S03E08.ass,816
Uh.,S03E08.ass,817

Right after this.,S03E08.ass,825
Slight delay.,S03E08.ass,826
You're outta gas.,S03E08.ass,827
"You're outta gas! Aw, Teddy.",S03E08.ass,828
How could you be so irresponsible?!,S03E08.ass,829
Says the guy who drove a car into our kitchen.,S03E08.ass,830
Close your eyes.,S03E08.ass,831

And.,S03E08.ass,845
Badly-damaged monkey.,S03E08.ass,846

I don't think she likes it.,S03E08.ass,848
"Well, she's.",S03E08.ass,849
She's about to.,S03E08.ass,850

Ta-da!,S03E08.ass,853
Happy Birthday!,S03E08.ass,854
It's your special birthday cake.,S03E08.ass,855
That's not cake.,S03E08.ass,856

I want princesses.,S03E08.ass,869
Really?,S03E08.ass,870
"Uh, did Mommy promise you a Princess?",S03E08.ass,871
"Mommy said, two princesses, please.",S03E08.ass,872
"All right, you heard her, Princess.",S03E08.ass,873
Make it happen.,S03E08.ass,874
Mommy said two.,S03E08.ass,875
Just breathe.,S03E08.ass,876
I'm sure Dad will find us a ride soon.,S03E08.ass,877
"Yeah, because he's so good with cars?",S03E08.ass,878
"Hey, sorry it took so long.",S03E08.ass,879
You went for ice cream at a time like this?,S03E08.ass,880
"Uh, well.",S03E08.ass,881
"Actually, the ice cream came to me.",S03E08.ass,882
You're taking me to the hospital in an ice cream truck?,S03E08.ass,883
You said to flag down the first thing I saw.,S03E08.ass,884
"Oh what's the matter, the giant hot dog wouldn't stop?",S03E08.ass,885
Yeah.,S03E08.ass,886
Okay.,S03E08.ass,887
"Push, Teddy.",S03E08.ass,888
"Welcome aboard Mustachio Pete's, the ice cream truck with the pistachio treats.",S03E08.ass,889
"FYI, pistachio has been discontinued.",S03E08.ass,890
"Bob, I need to lie down.",S03E08.ass,891
-Okay.,S03E08.ass,892
-You can use that bean bag chair.,S03E08.ass,893
It's where Mustachio Pete takes his 10 minute breaks.,S03E08.ass,894
Which Mustachio Pete is allowed by law.,S03E08.ass,895
"You're not gonna keep referring to yourself in the third person, are you?",S03E08.ass,896
"Yes, he is.",S03E08.ass,897
That's Mustachio Pete's trademark.,S03E08.ass,898
"That, and the pistachio, which, FYI.",S03E08.ass,899
Has been discontinued.,S03E08.ass,900

"Ooh, cool, I will.",S03E08.ass,906
He meant me!,S03E08.ass,907
Can we get going? It's an emergency.,S03E08.ass,908
Emergency?,S03E08.ass,909
This calls for the fast-paced music.,S03E08.ass,910
"Ready, Charlie?",S03E08.ass,911
It's Princess time!,S03E08.ass,912
I seem to have lost my sister Princess.,S03E08.ass,913
Excuse me.,S03E08.ass,914
-Get out there! -But I feel stupid!,S03E08.ass,915
-You think I don't? -You're used to it!,S03E08.ass,916

We're already doing 23.,S03E08.ass,931
I'm giving her all she's got.,S03E08.ass,932
Okay.,S03E08.ass,933
Baby's close. How much further?,S03E08.ass,934
"You're not helping yourself to any freebies back there, are you, Bob?",S03E08.ass,935
"I'm a stress eater, Pete.",S03E08.ass,936
You don't have to tell me about stress.,S03E08.ass,937
The ice cream truck business is dog-eat-dog.,S03E08.ass,938
I got Side Burn Sam nipping at my heels.,S03E08.ass,939
"Could we just focus on the road, Pete?",S03E08.ass,940
But both princesses are so beautiful.,S03E08.ass,941
How could I ever choose just one to be my wife?,S03E08.ass,942
"Dude, that's your line.",S03E08.ass,943
"Oh, right.",S03E08.ass,944
"Well, I guess there's only one way.",S03E08.ass,945
See whose foot fits the magic slipper.,S03E08.ass,946
Okay.,S03E08.ass,947
'Tis not I whose foot doth fit the slipper.,S03E08.ass,948
"Yes, tis not me, either.",S03E08.ass,949

And they seal their love.,S03E08.ass,959
With a kiss.,S03E08.ass,960
"Okay, we're done!",S03E08.ass,961
"Yeah, not quite.",S03E08.ass,962

"Welcome to the world, Toby Duncan.",S03E08.ass,996
"Hey, quick question.",S03E08.ass,997
Why are you guys dressed like that?,S03E08.ass,998
"Oh, because.",S03E08.ass,999
Mom promised Charlie princesses for her party.,S03E08.ass,1000
I never promised Charlie princesses.,S03E08.ass,1001
"Charlie, did you trick us?",S03E08.ass,1002
"Sweetie, did you get your special birthday present, Kuddle Me Katie?",S03E08.ass,1003
"No, Mommy.",S03E08.ass,1004
What? Why not?,S03E08.ass,1005
Bob?,S03E08.ass,1006
Gabe?,S03E08.ass,1007
PJ?,S03E08.ass,1008

"Sweetie, I'm sorry.",S03E08.ass,1011
"Wasn't much of a birthday, was it?",S03E08.ass,1012
"That's okay, Mommy.",S03E08.ass,1013
"Now, don't you worry.",S03E08.ass,1014
We will get you your special present.,S03E08.ass,1015
I like this present.,S03E08.ass,1016
"Okay, listen up.",S03E08.ass,1017

"So, when they come through the front door, you guys.",S03E08.ass,1019
Are gonna hold up this banner.,S03E08.ass,1020

"And Charlie, you're gonna give Mommy these balloons.",S03E08.ass,1023
And I'm gonna blow the noisemaker.,S03E08.ass,1024
"And then we're all gonna sing welcome home, Toby",S03E08.ass,1025
To the tune of the rock classic.,S03E08.ass,1026
Our House.,S03E08.ass,1027
Why do you get to blow the noisemaker?,S03E08.ass,1028
And why are we making such a big deal outta this?,S03E08.ass,1029
They bring a new baby home like every six months.,S03E08.ass,1030
This is what we always do.,S03E08.ass,1031
We did it for Charlie.,S03E08.ass,1032
Did you do it for me?,S03E08.ass,1033
Uh.,S03E08.ass,1034

"-You're lying! -No, I'm not.",S03E08.ass,1036
"Yeah, you are.",S03E08.ass,1037
You.,S03E08.ass,1038
"You know what? If you didn't do it for me, I'm not doing it for Toby.",S03E08.ass,1039
No matter how cool his name is.,S03E08.ass,1040
"Gabe, just pick up the stupid banner",S03E08.ass,1041
and join in this very touching family celebration!,S03E08.ass,1042
You can't make me.,S03E08.ass,1043
"Well, if he's not gonna do it, I'm not gonna do it.",S03E08.ass,1044
And if we not all gonna do it together.,S03E08.ass,1045
 It looks like Charlie could have made it.,S03E08.ass,1046
Good to be home.,S03E08.ass,1047
"This is what it's all about, isn't it? Now I see.",S03E08.ass,1048

Tell me who's your angel.,S03E08.ass,1054
"Who's your shoulder, to hold your boulders.",S03E08.ass,1055
Tell me when it's raining.,S03E08.ass,1056
Who will warm you.,S03E08.ass,1057
Who will hold you.,S03E08.ass,1058
You might be broken.,S03E08.ass,1059
With all these cracks in your skin.,S03E08.ass,1060
You might be broken that's where the light gets in.,S03E08.ass,1061
"You're something beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.",S03E08.ass,1062
"You're something beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.",S03E08.ass,1063
And I just want you to know.,S03E08.ass,1064
You to know.,S03E08.ass,1065
You to know.,S03E08.ass,1066
That you're not alone.,S03E08.ass,1067
You're not alone.,S03E08.ass,1068
"Hey, what you doing?",S03E08.ass,1069
Giving Toby a proper welcome home.,S03E08.ass,1070
"Well, Charlie, it's been kind of a big week.",S03E08.ass,1071
"I uh, I helped deliver a baby.",S03E08.ass,1072
"Our little brother, Toby.",S03E08.ass,1073
And you finally got your Kuddle Me Katie.,S03E08.ass,1074
Which you lost interest in five minutes after you got it.,S03E08.ass,1075
"Doesn't matter, Gabe's still paying for it.",S03E08.ass,1076
He worked out a little agreement with Mom and Dad.,S03E08.ass,1077
Gabe! Diaper change!,S03E08.ass,1078
And it's a doozy.,S03E08.ass,1079

"Speaking of, where is Dad?",S03E08.ass,1090
I'm ready to go home.,S03E08.ass,1091

Do you want to look in the bag?,S03E09,99
I like cash.,S03E09,100
I'm on a fixed income.,S03E09,101
"Amy, I'm not here on vacation.",S03E09,102

Keep having babies every five minutes.,S03E09,118
Oh.,S03E09,119
check out this old rattle.,S03E09,120
That was my son Rodney's.,S03E09,121
He loved that thing.,S03E09,122
The rhythmic noise.,S03E09,123
Would just mesmerize his little mind.,S03E09,124
PJ.,S03E09,125
Hmm?,S03E09,126
"Oh, hi, Mrs.",S03E09,127
Dabney.,S03E09,128
"You know, there might be some things here.",S03E09,129
That you boys would be interested in.,S03E09,130
We don't want your old junk.,S03E09,131
Fine.,S03E09,132
I'll just throw these old comics.,S03E09,133
And baseball cards away then.,S03E09,134
"No, no, no! I mean",S03E09,135
"We'll take them, but you owe us.",S03E09,136
"And now, the best part of my day",S03E09,137

"Oh, there was one more little thing.",S03E09,145
"What was it, what was it, what was it?",S03E09,146
"Oh, yeah.",S03E09,147
I can't stand grandma.,S03E09,148
But she's the sweetest lady in the world.,S03E09,149
"No, no.",S03E09,150
no.,S03E09,151

She's the sweetest lady in the world.,S03E09,153
And whatnot.,S03E09,154
"Yeah, she does say that a lot,",S03E09,155
Doesn't she?,S03E09,156
It's not just that.,S03E09,157
"It's the voice, and smile, and the comments,",S03E09,158
And the bobby's a movie star.,S03E09,159
"Please. if anyone's around here's a movie star,",S03E09,160
It's me.,S03E09,161
"Well, mom,",S03E09,162
She's only going to be here for two more days.,S03E09,163
Can't you just get through it?,S03E09,164
I don't know.,S03E09,165
"After the baby, I'm all hormonal,",S03E09,166
Just,S03E09,167
I don't have my usual censor.,S03E09,168
You have a censor?,S03E09,169
"Teddy, you have to help me, okay?",S03E09,170
You gotta keep grandma away from me.,S03E09,171
"Yeah, sure.",S03E09,172
I I love spending time.,S03E09,173
With grandma.,S03E09,174
"And just in case she gets on my nerves,",S03E09,175
We need a code word.,S03E09,176
"You know, something I can say.",S03E09,177
In case I'm about to blow.,S03E09,178
Platypi.,S03E09,179
that's a fun word.,S03E09,180
It's the plural for platypus.,S03E09,181
"Oh, honey.",S03E09,182
I need something that I can work into a conversation.,S03E09,183
Um,S03E09,184
Apple.,S03E09,185
I was at the zoo and I saw two platypi.,S03E09,186
How easy is that?,S03E09,187
We'll go with apple.,S03E09,188
Meh.,S03E09,189
No.,S03E09,190
Oh.,S03E09,191

Check out this old comic book.,S03E09,193
Gila Monster Man.,S03E09,194
Gila monster man? what's that about?,S03E09,195

Muenster.,S03E09,197
"By night, he's a crime-fighting superhero.",S03E09,198
Gila monster man.,S03E09,199
"All right, what's his super power?",S03E09,200
"When he hides under hot rocks,",S03E09,201
His body temperature rises.,S03E09,202
And gives him the ability to scorch villains.,S03E09,203
I'd hate to be the geek with that lunch box.,S03E09,204
You know?,S03E09,205
-What's that? -Just some old letter.,S03E09,206
"Hey, it's dated july 9, 1924.",S03E09,207
-Wow.,S03E09,208
-Listen to this.,S03E09,209
"My dearest brother,",S03E09,210
"As I am very ill,",S03E09,211
I send you this letter with great urgency.,S03E09,212
"As you know, in spite of my great wealth,",S03E09,213
I have had a lifelong distrust of banks.,S03E09,214
What does gila monster man do during the winter?,S03E09,215
"Quiet, quiet, quiet.",S03E09,216
"Blah, blah, blah, blah",S03E09,217
"All my money is buried in the backyard of my home,",S03E09,218
"10 feet due east from the oak tree,",S03E09,219
And four feet deep.,S03E09,220
"With loving regard, your brother, Orville.",S03E09,221
"Wait a minute, look at this.",S03E09,222
He lived in mrs.,S03E09,223
Dabney's house.,S03E09,224
And the letter was never mailed.,S03E09,225
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?,S03E09,226
We gotta get to the post office.,S03E09,227
"PJ, the letter was never mailed.",S03E09,228
No one knows about the money.,S03E09,229
It's probably still there.,S03E09,230
"So when mrs. Dabney's gone,",S03E09,231
We go dig it up.,S03E09,232
Oh.,S03E09,233
And we're rich.,S03E09,234
"Well, of course, the right thing to do.",S03E09,235
Would be to split it evenly with mrs.,S03E09,236
Dabney.,S03E09,237
"We're gonna do the wrong thing, though, aren't we?",S03E09,238
Move it back.,S03E09,239
There.,S03E09,240
"Now, isn't that better, bobby?",S03E09,241
"It is better, mommy.",S03E09,242
Hi.,S03E09,243
What's going on?,S03E09,244
"Oh, just a little rearranging and whatnot.",S03E09,245
Oh.,S03E09,246
Is that a good idea?,S03E09,247
"Oh, yes.",S03E09,248
It's an ancient chinese art.,S03E09,249
It's called fung shooey.,S03E09,250
"Hey, hon.",S03E09,251
come on in here a second.,S03E09,252
Huh?,S03E09,253
What do you think?,S03E09,254
Love it.,S03E09,255
It's easier to clean this way.,S03E09,256
I know that's always been a challenge for you.,S03E09,257
Apple.,S03E09,258
What?,S03E09,259
Mom's probably just talking about.,S03E09,260
What we're gonna have for dinner tonight.,S03E09,261
Apple?,S03E09,262
Don't you think we need something.,S03E09,263
A little more filling?,S03E09,264
Apple.,S03E09,265
"Grandma, you haven't seen my room.",S03E09,266
Come see my room.,S03E09,267
Okay.,S03E09,268
"So, like a caramel apple?",S03E09,269
"Thanks for the tour of your room, sweetheart.",S03E09,270
It was certainly through.,S03E09,271
"Oh, no.",S03E09,272
"uh, wait.",S03E09,273
Um,S03E09,274
Let's do something.,S03E09,275
"You know, just you and me.",S03E09,276
I need some more grandma time.,S03E09,277
All righty.,S03E09,278
"I'm not sure you're going to enjoy it,",S03E09,279
But I have an idea that might be fun.,S03E09,280
Extreme couponing.,S03E09,281
Extreme couponing?,S03E09,282
"Well, let me explain how it works.",S03E09,283
"Now this one's worth 50 cents,",S03E09,284
But it's a double coupon.,S03E09,285
Which means it's actually worth a dollar.,S03E09,286
Cool!,S03E09,287
"If I use this one on a qualifying item,",S03E09,288
It's triple times the double.,S03E09,289
"Believe it or not, I once got a case of pickle relish.",S03E09,290
For 12 cents.,S03E09,291
How was it?,S03E09,292
"Well, I'm not a pickle person.",S03E09,293
Um,S03E09,294
"Buy one 5-pound bag of kitty litter,",S03E09,295
Get the second bag free.,S03E09,296
Don't forget to triple your double.,S03E09,297
This is awesome.,S03E09,298
"You know, we don't have a cat,",S03E09,299
"But if we did, he'd be pooping for free.",S03E09,300
Shh.,S03E09,301
shh.,S03E09,302
Guys,S03E09,303
"I know I'm going to regret asking this, but",S03E09,304
Where are you going with that stuff?,S03E09,305
-The library.,S03E09,306
-We're in a play.,S03E09,307
Uh,S03E09,308
We're in a play at the library.,S03E09,309
And what is the name of the play?,S03E09,310
Shovel,S03E09,311
Kids.,S03E09,312
It's about kids who carry around shovels,S03E09,313
And make fun of the kids.,S03E09,314
Who carry around pickaxes.,S03E09,315
Pfft.,S03E09,316
ha.,S03E09,317
dork.,S03E09,318
You should never make fun of someone.,S03E09,319
With a pickax.,S03E09,320
That's one of my lines.,S03E09,321
Okay.,S03E09,322
What you doing?,S03E09,323
"Oh, want to get my facts straight",S03E09,324
Just on the off chance,S03E09,325
I have to fill out a police report later on.,S03E09,326
"Oh, five hours of couponing",S03E09,327
That was quite a sesh.,S03E09,328
"Grandma, is it normal to see dotted lines.",S03E09,329
Everywhere you look?,S03E09,330
I'm gonna head upstairs.,S03E09,331
"Oh, no, um,",S03E09,332
Let's do something else fun.,S03E09,333
"Oh, but your mother probably needs my help.",S03E09,334
And whatnot.,S03E09,335
But I need your help down here.,S03E09,336
With what?,S03E09,337
"With, um",S03E09,338
Uh with,S03E09,339
A makeover.,S03E09,340
You want me to give you a makeover?,S03E09,341
"Yeah, I mean, you know,",S03E09,342
I've I've been feeling kind of bored with my look.,S03E09,343
And you have such a great sense of style.,S03E09,344
"Well, I did pack an extra can of hair spray.",S03E09,345
"Oh, no.",S03E09,346
"Bob, honey.",S03E09,347
you're not a movie star.,S03E09,348
I've got something to show you.,S03E09,349
"May I present the new,",S03E09,350
"And improved, Teddy Duncan.",S03E09,351
"Teddy, what happened?",S03E09,352
"Oh, um",S03E09,353
Grandma gave me a makeover.,S03E09,354
So we could spend more time together.,S03E09,355
And whatnot.,S03E09,356
And that's not all.,S03E09,357
"Come on, sweetie.",S03E09,358
Come on.,S03E09,359
Let's go. oh!,S03E09,360
My hair is hard.,S03E09,361
"Hello, ma'am.",S03E09,362
Oh!,S03E09,363
No.,S03E09,364
today is our 10-month-aversary dinner.,S03E09,365
I totally forgot.,S03E09,366
"Well, when you get older",S03E09,367
Who's this handsome fellow?,S03E09,368
"Oh, grandma, this is my boyfriend Spencer.",S03E09,369
"Spencer, this is grandma Linda.",S03E09,370
-Hello.,S03E09,371
-Hi.,S03E09,372
Nice to meet you.,S03E09,373
I can see the family resemblance.,S03E09,374
All righty.,S03E09,375
"well, let me just go change real quick.",S03E09,376
Why do you need to change?,S03E09,377
We just got you fixed up.,S03E09,378
"Yes, we did. um",S03E09,379
I guess we're ready to go then.,S03E09,380
Oh.,S03E09,381
"you know what? I gotta go, too.",S03E09,382
It's bowling night.,S03E09,383
So,S03E09,384
"Teddy's going to dinner,",S03E09,385
And you're going bowling?,S03E09,386
Where are the boys?,S03E09,387
"Uh. they might be at the library,",S03E09,388
But I doubt it.,S03E09,389
"Well, Linda",S03E09,390
Looks like it's just you and me tonight.,S03E09,391
Apple?,S03E09,392
Or,S03E09,393
Happy anniversary.,S03E09,394
"You know,",S03E09,395
This would go a lot faster.,S03E09,396
If you helped me dig.,S03E09,397
"PJ, in every partnership,",S03E09,398
There's labor and there's management.,S03E09,399
-Why am I labor? -Because I'm management.,S03E09,400
"Wait, stop.",S03E09,401
I think I just heard mrs.,S03E09,402
Dabney pull up.,S03E09,403
-Come on! -All right.,S03E09,404
"-Hurry up, Hurry up.",S03E09,405
-Don't rush me.,S03E09,406
I'm not 12 anymore.,S03E09,407
Here you go.,S03E09,408
"And for you, ladies,",S03E09,409
The senior menu.,S03E09,410
"Um, could I have.",S03E09,411
A regular menu? I'm I'm 17.,S03E09,412
What a great attitude!,S03E09,413
"It's sweet of you kids to invite me,",S03E09,414
But I feel like I'm in the way.,S03E09,415
"Oh, no.",S03E09,416
"of course I want you here, grandma.",S03E09,417
"I've got my favorite guy,",S03E09,418
"My awesome grandma,",S03E09,419
My great new look,S03E09,420
"It's all coming together, right, Spencer?",S03E09,421
You bet.,S03E09,422
Especially since both of your meals.,S03E09,423
Will be half off.,S03E09,424
"Oh, which reminds me,",S03E09,425
I left my coupon in the car.,S03E09,426
Excuse me.,S03E09,427
"He's a couponer, too?",S03E09,428
You'd better hang on to him.,S03E09,429
"Oh, I'm sorry.",S03E09,430
we didn't order milk.,S03E09,431
They're from the gentlemen at table seven.,S03E09,432
What's going on here?,S03E09,433
Just admiring my new hot tub.,S03E09,434
"And may I say, thank you, boys.",S03E09,435
That hole you dug saved me a lot of money.,S03E09,436
We weren't digging the hole for a hot tub.,S03E09,437
There's a fortune down there.,S03E09,438
Why are you laughing?,S03E09,439
And why would you put a hot tub over a fortune?,S03E09,440
That's so stupid.,S03E09,441
She tricked us.,S03E09,442
She wrote the letter.,S03E09,443
-She did? -I did.,S03E09,444
She knew we'd dig the hole.,S03E09,445
Exactly where she wanted it.,S03E09,446
We're the stupid ones.,S03E09,447
-We are? -You are.,S03E09,448
Where's grandma?,S03E09,449
She's been in the bathroom a long time.,S03E09,450
"Oh, um, excuse me.",S03E09,451
Have you seen the woman who was sitting with us?,S03E09,452
Yes.,S03E09,453
she just got into a cab.,S03E09,454
Something about wanting you guys.,S03E09,455
To have some private time and whatnot.,S03E09,456
"Oh, no. she's going home!",S03E09,457
Platypi!,S03E09,458
What?,S03E09,459
Platypi.,S03E09,460
Aren't you loving the new setup?,S03E09,461
Uh-huh.,S03E09,462
It takes all the negative energy.,S03E09,463
And pushes it right through the door.,S03E09,464
Not all of it.,S03E09,465
We'll be fung shooing the kitchen tomorrow.,S03E09,466
"No, no, no.",S03E09,467
nothing's wrong with the kitchen.,S03E09,468
You're right.,S03E09,469
Can't blame the kitchen.,S03E09,470
For what goes on in there.,S03E09,471
Hi.,S03E09,472
What's going on?,S03E09,473
"Apple, apple, apple.",S03E09,474
Why do you keep saying that?,S03E09,475
"Oh, it's just this fun thing that we do.",S03E09,476
"She says that and then I answer back, pie, pie, pie!",S03E09,477
-No. -No!,S03E09,478
I can't do this anymore.,S03E09,479
You can't do what anymore?,S03E09,480
This!,S03E09,481
Smiling like a ninny.,S03E09,482
While you drive me out of my mind.,S03E09,483
"Well, I agree, you do smile like a ninny.",S03E09,484
But I can't see where it's my fault.,S03E09,485
See? there it goes again.,S03E09,486
"You know, the little digs, and the comments,",S03E09,487
"And the rearranging, and whatnot.",S03E09,488
"Whatnot, whatnot, whatnot!",S03E09,489
What does that even mean?,S03E09,490

So?,S03E10,361
"So, she's given her soup three times in the last hour.",S03E10,362
It's like it's on a continuous loop.,S03E10,363
You think Teddy's up to something?,S03E10,364
She's my daughter.,S03E10,365
I know she's up to something.,S03E10,366
"Of course, she's your daughter, too,",S03E10,367
so she shouldn't able to pull it off.,S03E10,368
Hey.,S03E10,369
Teddy's not picking up.,S03E10,370
You know what? I have a better idea.,S03E10,371
"Hi, Mrs.",S03E10,372
"Dabney, it's Amy Duncan.",S03E10,373
"No, don't hang up.",S03E10,374
Shh! Guys.,S03E10,375
guys.,S03E10,376
"Hi, Mrs.",S03E10,377
Dabney.,S03E10,378
What's up?.,S03E10,379
Your mother called and asked me to check on you.,S03E10,380
Said you were sick.,S03E10,381
Oh.,S03E10,382
"Yeah, I've got a really bad cold.",S03E10,383
So you put on a party dress?,S03E10,384
It always cheers me up.,S03E10,385
You know what cheers me up?,S03E10,386
Busting kids who lie to their parents.,S03E10,387
Really? That cheers you up?,S03E10,388
We all have our things.,S03E10,389
"Okay, Mrs.",S03E10,390
Dabney.,S03E10,391
You got me. What are you gonna do?,S03E10,392
"Lucky for you, there's one thing",S03E10,393
I like more than busting kids.,S03E10,394
-What's that? -Getting my party on.,S03E10,395
"Okay, so.",S03E10,396
"If I invite you to the party, this stays between us?",S03E10,397
You got a deal.,S03E10,398
"Ah, come on in.",S03E10,399
Let me call your mother and tell her everything's okay.,S03E10,400
Then I'll be back.,S03E10,401
"Oh, one question.",S03E10,402
Are kids these days still doing the hustle?,S03E10,403
What's that?,S03E10,404
Ooh.,S03E10,405
You are in for a treat.,S03E10,406
"Well, thank you very much for checking Mrs.",S03E10,407
Dabney.,S03E10,408
I'm.,S03E10,409
I'm sorry to have bothered you.,S03E10,410
"I don't get it, she said Teddy was",S03E10,411
laying on the couch sick as a dog.,S03E10,412
That's nice.,S03E10,413
"Hi, mommy.",S03E10,414
May we help you?,S03E10,415
"Charlie got scared, and thought it would be a good idea",S03E10,416
if we all came and slept with you.,S03E10,417
"No, I didn't.",S03E10,418
She's embarrassed.,S03E10,419
"Okay, just for a little while.",S03E10,420
Why do little knees always find that spot?,S03E10,421
Oh.,S03E10,422
Is this a great party or what?,S03E10,423
"No, really.",S03E10,424
I'm asking.,S03E10,425
I have no frame of reference.,S03E10,426
"Hey, where's Mrs. Dabney?",S03E10,427
I thought she was supposed to be coming over?,S03E10,428
Maybe she couldn't find something to wear.,S03E10,429
Where's your turntable? I'm ready to boogie!,S03E10,430
"Okay, what was that?",S03E10,431
It's the ghost.,S03E10,432
-Or the killer.,S03E10,433
-Or the killer ghost.,S03E10,434
Or the ghost killer.,S03E10,435
"Bob, wake up.",S03E10,436
I'm up! I'm up.,S03E10,437
I'm up.,S03E10,438
Bob.,S03E10,439
"Bob, turn on the lights.",S03E10,440
They don't work.,S03E10,441
Question.,S03E10,442
Was that wall dripping red ooze this afternoon?,S03E10,443
"Follow up question,",S03E10,444
Does anyone else see the floating candelabra?,S03E10,445
Get out!,S03E10,446
Get out!,S03E10,447
Oh!,S03E10,448
Whoa!,S03E10,449
Last summer it was us.,S03E10,450
Now it's your turn.,S03E10,451
He's got a knife!,S03E10,452
You're all gonna die.,S03E10,453
When you learn you're on Scary House.,S03E10,454
What's going on?,S03E10,455
Scary House.,S03E10,456
America's favorite new reality show.,S03E10,457
"Where we take an average family,",S03E10,458
and convince them,S03E10,459
in a haunted house.,S03E10,460
This was all a prank?,S03E10,461
That's terrible.,S03E10,462
You made us look like fools.,S03E10,463
You people are disgusting.,S03E10,464
"We're gonna be on TV, you say?",S03E10,465
"When the Duncans checked into Scary House,",S03E10,466
They had no idea what they were in for.,S03E10,467
"Wow, mom.",S03E10,468
That was quite a scream.,S03E10,469
"Yeah, that was PJ.",S03E10,470
"And if you want to see something really scary,",S03E10,471
Check out what we saw on mama Duncan's laptop.,S03E10,472
What was that?,S03E10,473
Um.,S03E10,474
That is called the hustle.,S03E10,475
It was a very popular dance move in the 1970s.,S03E10,476
And what was it doing in our living room?,S03E10,477
"Look, mom.",S03E10,478
I don't have time for all these questions.,S03E10,479
Because I have to do my video diary.,S03E10,480
"Hi, Charlie.",S03E10,481
"well, we have had quite a weekend.",S03E10,482
But you know what? It's all behind us,S03E10,483
"now, so why don't we forget it.",S03E10,484
And move on with our lives.,S03E10,485
Some of us won't be moving on with,S03E10,486
anything for the next two weeks.,S03E10,487
-Me?  -Yeah.,S03E10,488
Can you dig it?,S03E10,489
"Wish her good luck, Charlie.",S03E10,490
"Oh, you've got to be kidding me.",S03E10,491
How much longer is this going to go on?,S03E10,492
What are we going to do?,S03E10,493
"Well, there's only one thing to do.",S03E10,494
Ah! That's it.,S03E10,495
Get your groove on.,S03E10,496
"Far out, man.",S03E10,497
I can dig it.,S03E10,498
"-Howdy, folks.",S03E10,499
-Oh!.,S03E10,500
"Morning, mom.",S03E11,0
Eh.,S03E11,1
Tough night?,S03E11,2
I had to get up three times with the baby,S03E11,3
and your father was absolutely no help.,S03E11,4
Sure I was.,S03E11,5
Flicking me in the forehead and saying,S03E11,6
baby's crying is not helpful.,S03E11,7
"Honey, if I flicked you in the forehead and",S03E11,8
"didn't say anything, It's just being mean",S03E11,9
"Hey, after breakfast, if somebody watch",S03E11,10
Toby while I grab a shower?,S03E11,11
"Oh, I can't.",S03E11,12
I have a maggot-infested rats' nest that needs my attention.,S03E11,13
-Bye.,S03E11,14
-Bye.,S03E11,15
"Sorry, mom.",S03E11,16
"I'd love to, but I'm going to the mall with Ivy.",S03E11,17
We're gonna shop and look for jobs.,S03E11,18
Mostly shop.,S03E11,19
See you.,S03E11,20
And I'm taking Charlie to the park.,S03E11,21
"Oh, maybe you can take Toby with you.",S03E11,22
"No thank you, mama.",S03E11,23
Hmm.,S03E11,24
-Bye.,S03E11,25
-Bye.,S03E11,26
Gabe?,S03E11,27
"No thank you, mama.",S03E11,28
Today's all burnt toast ,S03E11,29
"Running late, and dad jokes",S03E11,30
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S03E11,31
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S03E11,32
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S03E11,33
There it is up on the roof,S03E11,34
"I've been there, I've survived",S03E11,35
So just take my advice,S03E11,36
"Hang in there, baby",S03E11,37
Things are crazy,S03E11,38
But I know your future's bright,S03E11,39
"Hang in there, baby",S03E11,40
There's no maybe,S03E11,41
Everything turns out all right,S03E11,42
Your life is up and down,S03E11,43
But trust me it comes back around,S03E11,44
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S03E11,45
"Hang in there, baby.",S03E11,46
"Okay, Charlie.",S03E11,47
Here we go.,S03E11,48
Have fun.,S03E11,49
Not too fast.,S03E11,50
Not too fast.,S03E11,51
She's already the fastest kid in the park.,S03E11,52
"If you want to see fast, you should",S03E11,53
see my nephew Mason ride his trike.,S03E11,54
You know what his friends call him?,S03E11,55
-What? -Nothing.,S03E11,56
"He's so fast, he doesn't have time to make friends.",S03E11,57
"Yeah, well, Charlie's so fast,",S03E11,58
that.,S03E11,59
that she makes friends.,S03E11,60
"But then she goes so far, by the time she",S03E11,61
comes back they've changed their move on,S03E11,62
And.,S03E11,63
I am really not good at this.,S03E11,64
"The point is, Mason's faster.",S03E11,65
No.,S03E11,66
Charlie's faster.,S03E11,67
You know what this reminds me of?,S03E11,68
The conversation that we had before the baby race.,S03E11,69
Oh.,S03E11,70
The baby race.,S03E11,71
"Come on, Charlie, you can do it.",S03E11,72
"Coming down the home stretch, it's still Mason in the lead!",S03E11,73
"Come on, Charlie. It's now or never!",S03E11,74
And the winner is Charlie!,S03E11,75
Okay.,S03E11,76
"Charlie may be faster on her feet, but on wheels?",S03E11,77
Mason's the man.,S03E11,78
Guess there's only one way to find out.,S03E11,79
Are you saying what I think you're saying?,S03E11,80
Baby race two.,S03E11,81
The empire trikes back!,S03E11,82
"Hey, dad.",S03E11,83
"Hi, Mr.",S03E11,84
Wentz.,S03E11,85
We're going to the mall to shop and look for jobs.,S03E11,86
But mostly shop.,S03E11,87
-Wallet's over there. -How much can I take?,S03E11,88
Doesn't matter.,S03E11,89
Nothing matters.,S03E11,90
"Ivy, why is your dad so depressed?",S03E11,91
I don't know.,S03E11,92
I think it might be something about his job.,S03E11,93
-What does he do? -I don't know.,S03E11,94
"Ivy, you're not going to the mall",S03E11,95
"without cleaning your room, are you?",S03E11,96
"Oh, Harry, honey.",S03E11,97
I don't know why you're so down.,S03E11,98
Show Teddy the award you got last night.,S03E11,99
That's the silver plungie.,S03E11,100
It's in recognition of Harry's 25 years,S03E11,101
in the plumbing supply business.,S03E11,102
"Oh, congratulations, Mr.",S03E11,103
Wentz.,S03E11,104
That is quite an honor.,S03E11,105
"Well, I think so.",S03E11,106
It even has an inscription.,S03E11,107
see?.,S03E11,108
"It says, to harry wentz, for 25 years of duty.",S03E11,109
"Well, that's unfortunate.",S03E11,110
"Oh, I'm gonna go find a place for it.",S03E11,111
Is this all I have to show.,S03E11,112
For 25 years of my life?,S03E11,113
A plunger that they spray-painted silver.,S03E11,114
"It's glittery, too.",S03E11,115
I used to have dreams.,S03E11,116
Big dreams.,S03E11,117
I wanted to be.,S03E11,118
A weatherman.,S03E11,119
I wanted to open a restaurant.,S03E11,120
But.,S03E11,121
I'm too old for any of that now.,S03E11,122
Mr.,S03E11,123
"Wentz, you are never too old to pursue your dreams.",S03E11,124
"Oh, Teddy, I don't know.",S03E11,125
Have you seen that commercial for the new fitness centers?,S03E11,126
The one with the talking gophers?,S03E11,127
Right.,S03E11,128
The skinny gopher says to the fat gopher.,S03E11,129
"If you want to lose that weight, you",S03E11,130
gotta get off your butt and go for it.,S03E11,131
"Sure, it's a terrific commercial.",S03E11,132
But what's your point?,S03E11,133
"That's what you gotta do, Mr.",S03E11,134
Wentz.,S03E11,135
You gotta follow your dreams and gopher it!,S03E11,136
Gopher it.,S03E11,137
Gopher it.,S03E11,138
Why are you dressed like that?,S03E11,139
Why are you dressed like that?,S03E11,140
Because I haven't had a chance to do the laundry.,S03E11,141
"Believe it or not, this is your shirt, your dad's sweats,",S03E11,142
And you don't even want to know whose underwear I have on.,S03E11,143
-They're PJ's.,S03E11,144
-You don't know that.,S03E11,145
I can see batman's head on the waistband.,S03E11,146
What is that smell?,S03E11,147
That's my new body spray.,S03E11,148
Check it out.,S03E11,149
Duude.,S03E11,150
With two us.,S03E11,151
Body spray for cool dudes ages 12 to 13.,S03E11,152
What's all this about?,S03E11,153
Nothing.,S03E11,154
"Oh, and by the way, for the next couple of days,",S03E11,155
I'm gonna be working on a project,S03E11,156
with a kid from summer school.,S03E11,157
"Oh, I see. Is this kid a boy kid or a girl kid?",S03E11,158
I don't remember.,S03E11,159
When I'm at school I'm all about the work.,S03E11,160
Aw.,S03E11,161
My little baby has a crush.,S03E11,162
"Honey, can I give you some advice?",S03E11,163
I'm 13 now.,S03E11,164
I don't need any help from my mommy.,S03E11,165
That's a direct quote from the Duude commercial.,S03E11,166
Get out!,S03E11,167
Okay.,S03E11,168
I got all dressed up for nothing?,S03E11,169
"Hi, Gabe.",S03E11,170
"Hi, Jade.",S03E11,171
I like hanging out at your house.,S03E11,172
It's always so nice and pieceful.,S03E11,173
You did what?! Without even asking me?,S03E11,174
"Harry, you come back here!",S03E11,175
"Girls, I have some exciting news.",S03E11,176
"Your father quit his job, took our",S03E11,177
"life savings, and bought a restaurant.",S03E11,178
I combined both my passions and created,S03E11,179
the world's first weather themed eatery.,S03E11,180
Hurricane Harry's weather cafe.,S03E11,181
And I owe it all to teddy.,S03E11,182
What did I do?,S03E11,183
You did this.,S03E11,184
And we're all gonna work there.,S03E11,185
Me? What did I do?,S03E11,186
"Well, you wanted jobs? Now you got them.",S03E11,187
"-That's okay, Mr.",S03E11,188
Wentz.,S03E11,189
"-Oh, no, no, no, no, Teddy.",S03E11,190
"You are going to be a part of this, too.",S03E11,191
"Because of you, this family is",S03E11,192
taking a ride on a crazy train.,S03E11,193
All aboard.,S03E11,194
Woo-woo.,S03E11,195
Hmm.,S03E11,196
Ah.,S03E11,197
Okay.,S03E11,198
"Charlie, I've made some adjustments.",S03E11,199
Your trike is now more airdynamic.,S03E11,200
Where's my bell?,S03E11,201
"Oh, you don't need a bell,",S03E11,202
you'll be in front all the time.,S03E11,203
Right?,S03E11,204
Yes.,S03E11,205
"Well, well, well. You here to back out?",S03E11,206
"No, I'm here to show you a preview of what",S03E11,207
you're gonna see tomorrow after the race.,S03E11,208
My victory dance.,S03E11,209
Uh! You like that?,S03E11,210
-Oh yeah? -Yeah.,S03E11,211
"Well, I got a victory dance, too.",S03E11,212
-Where's it at? -Goes a little something like this.,S03E11,213
"That's okay, you like this?",S03E11,214
"Oh, yes.",S03E11,215
"All right, everybody, we open in five minutes.",S03E11,216
Where's mother nature?,S03E11,217
Here I am.,S03E11,218
"Oh, Mary Lou, you look stunning.",S03E11,219
"Oh, you know what?",S03E11,220
"I thought this would be silly, but I must say.",S03E11,221
I do make it work.,S03E11,222
"All right, where are my special waitresses?",S03E11,223
Sunny and cloudy?,S03E11,224
Here we are.,S03E11,225
So.,S03E11,226
"Kind of a bummer having to go to summer school, right?",S03E11,227
I like summer school.,S03E11,228
Me too.,S03E11,229
"When I said bummer, I meant bummer!",S03E11,230
You can't change the meaning of a,S03E11,231
word by just saying it differently.,S03E11,232
Bummer.,S03E11,233
Um.,S03E11,234
I'll be right back.,S03E11,235
Hey.,S03E11,236
"How's it going out there, tiger?",S03E11,237
Terrible.,S03E11,238
I keep saying the wrong thing.,S03E11,239
Well.,S03E11,240
I know how you can win her over,S03E11,241
without saying a single word.,S03E11,242
The baby? How is he gonna help me?,S03E11,243
Once she sees how great you are with Toby.,S03E11,244
She is guaranteed to melt.,S03E11,245
Now.,S03E11,246
Hold him close.,S03E11,247
Cradle the head.,S03E11,248
I hope you're better with girls than my older brother.,S03E11,249
"Jade, I don't think you've met my baby brother.",S03E11,250
This is Toby.,S03E11,251
"Oh my gosh, he's so cute.",S03E11,252
And you're so good with him.,S03E11,253
The trick is to cradle the head.,S03E11,254
"Here, have some more rain.",S03E11,255
That's what we call water.,S03E11,256
Isn't that fun?,S03E11,257
"Martin, party of four, your table is ready.",S03E11,258
This is hurricane Harry with a special bulletin.,S03E11,259
The forecast for the next few minutes is entertaining.,S03E11,260
"Ladies and gentlemen, the musical stylings of.",S03E11,261
Wentz's weather girls.,S03E11,262
Hit it.,S03E11,263
"Hurricane Harry's is the spot doo-dah, doo-dah.",S03E11,264
We serve our dishes cold and hot all the doo-dah day.,S03E11,265
And night!,S03E11,266
Wentz's weather girls.,S03E11,267
And they'll be back to do it again every hour on the hour.,S03E11,268
I liked it better when I didn't know what my dad did.,S03E11,269
Think we're dry enough to go in yet?,S03E11,270
Nope.,S03E11,271
Still squishing.,S03E11,272
Hey.,S03E11,273
What hit us during that last storm? Was that sleet?,S03E11,274
No.,S03E11,275
Kid threw a bowl of nachos into the fan.,S03E11,276
We gotta quit this job.,S03E11,277
We can't. Your mom would kill me,S03E11,278
and your dad will be crushed.,S03E11,279
"Well, if he adds an earthquake tomorrow,",S03E11,280
we might actually be crushed.,S03E11,281
"Wait, we can't quit.",S03E11,282
But we could get fired.,S03E11,283
Yeah.,S03E11,284
"Ooh, I don't know what you're thinking, but I like it.",S03E11,285
"Hey, do you mind if we take a break for a second?",S03E11,286
Why?,S03E11,287
There's just this thing I do for my baby brother.,S03E11,288
I share life lessons and give him advice.,S03E11,289
I call it a video diary.,S03E11,290
That is the sweetest thing ever.,S03E11,291
I get that a lot.,S03E11,292
"Hey, Char.",S03E11,293
Toby.,S03E11,294
It's your big brother Gabe here with,S03E11,295
another one of my signature video diary.,S03E11,296
"Anyway, last night after I tucked",S03E11,297
you in and kissed you in your head.,S03E11,298
I sang you to sleep with a song.,S03E11,299
"Oh, can you sing it now?",S03E11,300
Please?,S03E11,301
Um.,S03E11,302
"Hush, little Toby go to sleep.",S03E11,303
You're already asleep so stay asleep.,S03E11,304
La-la-la la-la-la la-la-la.,S03E11,305
Sleep.,S03E11,306
"Sleepy sleep, sleepy sleep sleep, sleep, sleep.",S03E11,307
Aw.,S03E11,308
"Well, that's all for now, so, I'll just say.",S03E11,309
Good.,S03E11,310
"Fortune, Toby.",S03E11,311
That's sort of my trademark.,S03E11,312
"Now, remember, Charlie.",S03E11,313
Winning isn't everything.,S03E11,314
-It's the only thing.,S03E11,315
-Yes.,S03E11,316
Yes.,S03E11,317
"Okay, you know that shame you felt for the last two years?",S03E11,318
It ends today.,S03E11,319
Or it could get worse depending on how this goes.,S03E11,320
Okay.,S03E11,321
The race is to that lamppost and back.,S03E11,322
First trike to cross the finish line wins.,S03E11,323
Wins what?,S03E11,324
"-Hey, dad. -What is going on?",S03E11,325
Nothing.,S03E11,326
We're just hanging out at the park.,S03E11,327
Then why have the kids got numbers on them?,S03E11,328
Because we're teaching them their ones and twos.,S03E11,329
How many times have we been over this?,S03E11,330
You cannot race children like horses.,S03E11,331
Can we race them like dogs?,S03E11,332
You can't race them at all.,S03E11,333
"All right, kids, come on. Hey,",S03E11,334
who wants to go the playground.,S03E11,335
"Huh? Okay, come on.",S03E11,336
Man!,S03E11,337
I was all fired up for a race today.,S03E11,338
"Yeah, me too.",S03E11,339
"You know, we could still have a race.",S03E11,340
Where's Toby?,S03E11,341
Dad took him to the park.,S03E11,342
What?,S03E11,343
"No, no, Jade's about to leave and I need to make a move.",S03E11,344
So make your move.,S03E11,345
I don't have a move.,S03E11,346
I need Toby.,S03E11,347
she likes it when I do nice things for him.,S03E11,348
"Gabe, I'm leaving.",S03E11,349
Wait!,S03E11,350
Hey.,S03E11,351
So.,S03E11,352
Um.,S03E11,353
Uh.,S03E11,354
I was just wondering if.,S03E11,355
You wanted to go to a movie with me sometime?,S03E11,356
Oh.,S03E11,357
Um.,S03E11,358
"No, thank you.",S03E11,359
But I thought you were kinda into me?,S03E11,360
"Yeah, as a friend but.",S03E11,361
I could never date you.,S03E11,362
I like bad boys.,S03E11,363
Wha.,S03E11,364
but I am a bad boy.,S03E11,365
I was just kidding about all that baby stuff.,S03E11,366
"Gabe, be proud of who you are.",S03E11,367
"A sweet, sensitive, good boy.",S03E11,368
No.,S03E11,369
I'm not.,S03E11,370
"I'm a total jerk, ask anyone.",S03E11,371
Sweetie-pie.,S03E11,372
This blanket you knit for the baby is.,S03E11,373
Absolutely precious.,S03E11,374
"Bye, Gabe.",S03E11,375
Whoa!,S03E11,376
Woo! Yes! Yes!,S03E11,377
Watch this!,S03E11,378
"Well, that brings us to the top of",S03E11,379
the hour which means it is time,S03E11,380
To give it up again for wentz's weather girls.,S03E11,381
You ready to get fired?,S03E11,382
Hit it.,S03E11,383
I guess that was a bad idea.,S03E11,384
We've ruined everything.,S03E11,385
"If you have to make some tough choices, we understand.",S03E11,386
And I'm talking about firing us.,S03E11,387
That was.,S03E11,388
Awesome!,S03E11,389
My weather girls.,S03E11,390
We are going to be together forever.,S03E11,391
"Well, what do you know.",S03E11,392
My boys.,S03E11,393
Yeah.,S03E11,394
He woke up from his nap so we're just hanging out.,S03E11,395
Oh.,S03E11,396
You know who Toby reminds me of?,S03E11,397
You.,S03E11,398
Because he doesn't have a girlfriend?,S03E11,399
No.,S03E11,400
Because you both have that sparkle in your eyes.,S03E11,401
And that's another thing girls like.,S03E11,402
A sparkle.,S03E11,403
"Thanks, mom.",S03E11,404
"Well, since you're watching toby, you don't,",S03E11,405
"um, mind if I take a nap, do you?",S03E11,406
"Well, I.",S03E11,407
"I guess, but if he.",S03E11,408
Mom?,S03E11,409
"Hey, Toby.",S03E11,410
Gabe here.,S03E11,411
"So, I want to tell you everything",S03E11,412
that I've learned about girls.,S03E11,413
That's it.,S03E11,414
"Anyway, if you ever need any advice in the future.",S03E11,415
Wait.,S03E11,416
what.,S03E11,417
what are you doing?.,S03E11,418
Making a video diary for Toby.,S03E11,419
Wha.,S03E11,420
that's kind of my thing.,S03E11,421
Not any more.,S03E11,422
So.,S03E11,423
The next time I have a crush on a,S03E11,424
"girl, wish me good furtune, Toby.",S03E11,425
"Oh, you've got to be kidding me.",S03E11,426
Jealous?,S03E11,427
What? No.,S03E11,428
Confused.,S03E11,429
What does.,S03E11,430
"Good fortune,Toby.",S03E11,431
Even mean.,S03E11,432
It means that Toby has the good fortune,S03E11,433
"not to hear Good luck, Charlie.",S03E11,434
"Okay, give me my camera.",S03E11,435
"Good fortune, Toby.",S03E11,436
"Good luck, Charlie.",S03E11,437
Woo.,S03E11,438
What a ride.,S03E11,439
"You know, after a workout like that,",S03E11,440
I don't want some kind of kiddie bubble bath.,S03E11,441
I'm 12 to 13 now.,S03E11,442
I want a body spray that works as hard as I do.,S03E11,443
That's why I use Duude.,S03E11,444
"Duude, when you don't need help from your mommy any more.",S03E11,445
"Duude, from the makers of Guy and Bro.",S03E11,446
"Chew carefully, I'm missing an earring.",S03E12,0
"Eh, I'll roll the dice.",S03E12,1
"Hey, everybody.",S03E12,2
I have some big news.,S03E12,3
- I'm moving out.  - You're what?,S03E12,4
What do you mean you're moving out?,S03E12,5
I am moving in with Emmett.,S03E12,6
His parents promised him an apartment when he turned 18.,S03E12,7
"They had a party for him, gave him a cake",S03E12,8
and drove him to the new place.,S03E12,9
All in like 20 minutes.,S03E12,10
P.,S03E12,11
J.,S03E12,12
", I'm not sure about this.",S03E12,13
"Mom, it totally makes sense.",S03E12,14
I'm about to start Community College,S03E12,15
and the apartment is right near campus.,S03E12,16
That is a good point.,S03E12,17
Blah blah blah.,S03E12,18
All I'm hearing is that I'm getting my own room.,S03E12,19
Let's get you packed.,S03E12,20
Come on.,S03E12,21
"Bob, are you sure PJ's ready to live on his own?",S03E12,22
"Well, he is 18, honey.",S03E12,23
"Oh, it sounds like somebody's experiencing empty-nest syndrome.",S03E12,24
"Well, the good news there is that our nest is still very very full.",S03E12,25
"In fact, the challenge is to avoid having any more little birdies.",S03E12,26
It just went by so fast.,S03E12,27
It seems like just yesterday that P.,S03E12,28
J.,S03E12,29
was tripping.,S03E12,30
over his shoelaces and we were wiping his nose.,S03E12,31
It was yesterday.,S03E12,32
Today's all burnt toast,S03E12,33
Running late and Dad jokes.,S03E12,34
Has anybody seen my left shoe?,S03E12,35
"I close my eyes, take a bite.",S03E12,36
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud.",S03E12,37
There it is up on the roof.,S03E12,38
"I've been there, I survived.",S03E12,39
So just take my advice.,S03E12,40
"Hang in there, baby",S03E12,41
things are crazy.,S03E12,42
But I know your future's bright.,S03E12,43
"Hang in there, baby",S03E12,44
there's no maybe.,S03E12,45
Everything turns out all right.,S03E12,46
Sure life is up and down.,S03E12,47
"But trust me, it comes back around.",S03E12,48
You're gonna love who you turn out to be.,S03E12,49
"Hang in there, baby.",S03E12,50
"- Oh, my Mom's here.",S03E12,51
- Aw.,S03E12,52
"Hello, Teddy. Spence, you ready?",S03E12,53
I left my coat downstairs.,S03E12,54
I'll be right back.,S03E12,55
Would you like to come in?,S03E12,56
"Oh no, that's okay.",S03E12,57
"I'm fine, thanks.",S03E12,58
So it's been awhile. How have you been?,S03E12,59
I'm good.,S03E12,60
Thank you.,S03E12,61
- And you?  - Good good.,S03E12,62
So how about that weather?,S03E12,63
"It's like it's not too hot, not too cold.",S03E12,64
"Temperate, you might say.",S03E12,65
Yes， Temperate.,S03E12,66
Temperate.,S03E12,67
"Oh, Spencer's back.",S03E12,68
Yay!.,S03E12,69
"Hey, it wasn't there.",S03E12,70
I must have left it in the backyard.,S03E12,71
- I'll just.,S03E12,72
- No no.,S03E12,73
You can get it next time.,S03E12,74
Out you go.,S03E12,75
- Bye.,S03E12,76
"- Bye, guys.",S03E12,77
Temperate? What.,S03E12,78
?.,S03E12,79
"Bob, would you take Toby upstairs and put him down for his nap?",S03E12,80
Uh.,S03E12,81
Up.,S03E12,82
Up.,S03E12,83
Upstairs?.,S03E12,84
That's uh.,S03E12,85
"It's kinda lonely up there, isn't it?",S03E12,86
Would you take Toby upstairs and put him down for his nap?,S03E12,87
"Hey, you know what? Have him nap right here.",S03E12,88
"Bob, he's six weeks old.",S03E12,89
Never too early to learn how to couch-nap.,S03E12,90
"Okay, fine.",S03E12,91
I will take him upstairs.,S03E12,92
And you better get real comfortable on that couch.,S03E12,93
- What was that about?  - What?,S03E12,94
Not wanting to take the baby upstairs.,S03E12,95
"I mean, that's lazy.",S03E12,96
Even for you.,S03E12,97
What? I just didn't feel like it.,S03E12,98
That's all.,S03E12,99
"No, there's something going on with you.",S03E12,100
Since when did you become so interested in me?,S03E12,101
Since the cable went out.,S03E12,102
"Man, this place is great.",S03E12,103
We should really call your Dad and thank him.,S03E12,104
We can't. Part of the agreement about the new apartment is,S03E12,105
that I never call.,S03E12,106
This is so awesome.,S03E12,107
We can eat whatever we want.,S03E12,108
Stay up past our bedtime.,S03E12,109
"Dude, there is no bedtime!",S03E12,110
"Yay, we're adults now!",S03E12,111
Yeah!,S03E12,112
"Dude, I'm gonna go check out the view.",S03E12,113
"Hey, look at this clown.",S03E12,114
"Oh, it's an actual clown.",S03E12,115
"You're not still afraid of clowns, are you?",S03E12,116
No.,S03E12,117
You know what the best part  about this place is?  - Huh?,S03E12,118
Our moms aren't around to tell us what to do.,S03E12,119
Ah.,S03E12,120
It's your Mom.,S03E12,121
"Hi, guys! Brought you some lunch.",S03E12,122
Lunch.,S03E12,123
Awesome.,S03E12,124
Except for we don't have any plates Or forks.,S03E12,125
"Hey, why don't you go see if that clown next door has any?",S03E12,126
I'm on it.,S03E12,127
"Sweetheart, that's not nice.",S03E12,128
We don't call our neighbors clowns.,S03E12,129
"Well, if I knew his professional name I'd use it.",S03E12,130
So what do you think of the place?,S03E12,131
- It's nice! - Yeah.,S03E12,132
"Yeah, it's a little small maybe.",S03E12,133
Call it cozy.,S03E12,134
Kinda drafty.,S03E12,135
We call it inside breezy.,S03E12,136
That's Emmett's bed and that's mine.,S03E12,137
"Oh, Emmett's a little messy, isn't he?",S03E12,138
Yeah.,S03E12,139
"Well, that's Emmett.",S03E12,140
"Honey, just because it's Emmett's apartment",S03E12,141
doesn't mean you should let him walk all over you.,S03E12,142
"If you don't like the mess, say something.",S03E12,143
"Mom, stop worrying, okay? It's gonna be fine.",S03E12,144
We're grown-ups now.,S03E12,145
"Ugh, it was just so awkward and I kept saying temperate.",S03E12,146
And I never say temperate.,S03E12,147
You just said it twice.,S03E12,148
Does your Mom like me?,S03E12,149
"Hey, of course she likes you.",S03E12,150
"I mean, does your Mom like me?",S03E12,151
Let's keep it on your Mom.,S03E12,152
"Hey Teddy, look, my Mom likes you, all right?",S03E12,153
That's just how she is.,S03E12,154
"You know, she's reserved.",S03E12,155
"Well, I want us to have a good relationship.",S03E12,156
So tell me some stuff about her.,S03E12,157
"Okay, um, what do you want to know?",S03E12,158
I want to know who is Lynn Walsh?,S03E12,159
"What's her favorite color, her favorite food?",S03E12,160
Who would play her in the movie of her life?,S03E12,161
Do you know that stuff about your Mom?,S03E12,162

"Uh, oh, she likes going to this one fancy place downtown for high tea.",S03E12,170
Great.,S03E12,171
"Okay, keep going.",S03E12,172
That's all I got.,S03E12,173
That's it?,S03E12,174
"Hey look, I think it's pretty great I came up with that.",S03E12,175
"Okay, I just had an awesome idea.",S03E12,176
I'm gonna take your Mom out to tea and we're gonna talk about orchids.,S03E12,177
And tea.,S03E12,178
That's great.,S03E12,179
"I don't have to come to this, do I?",S03E12,180
I just need you to watch the baby for a sec.,S03E12,181
Whoa!.,S03E12,182
No!,S03E12,183
No!,S03E12,184
Oh ow!,S03E12,185
Mmm. Nobody tells Mom!,S03E12,186
- What are we not telling Mom?  - What?,S03E12,187
What?,S03E12,188
"Dude, you just yelled nobody tells Mom in your sleep.",S03E12,189
"I mean I'm in, I just want to know what we're not telling her.",S03E12,190
No.,S03E12,191
"No, I was just dreaming about that time I dropped Charlie.",S03E12,192
Oh.,S03E12,193
I remember that day.,S03E12,194
That was a really good sandwich.,S03E12,195
Now I'm worried I'm gonna do the same thing to Toby.,S03E12,196
I can't stop thinking about it.,S03E12,197
So that's why you didn't want to carry him up the stairs.,S03E12,198
I don't want to carry him down the stairs either.,S03E12,199
"- What are you gonna do, Dad? - I don't know!",S03E12,200
But I can't drop Toby like I did Charlie.,S03E12,201
- You did what? - I did wh.,S03E12,202
Hey!.,S03E12,203
"Hey hey, Sweetie.",S03E12,204

It was more.,S03E12,206
It.,S03E12,207
It.,S03E12,208
It was more like a toss.,S03E12,209
And then you flew a little!,S03E12,210
Bad Daddy.,S03E12,211
But Daddy caught you.,S03E12,212
Lucky Daddy.,S03E12,213
"Thanks for buying plates and forks, Emmett.",S03E12,214
Too bad we're having soup.,S03E12,215
"Hey, would you mind picking that up?",S03E12,216
"I will, just let me finish my plate of soup first.",S03E12,217
- It'll take one second.,S03E12,218
- I don't have a second.,S03E12,219
Soup gets cold really fast when it's on a plate.,S03E12,220
How long does it take to pick up a piece of trash?,S03E12,221
"Okay, well, wait. What's your problem?",S03E12,222
My problem is my roommate is a slob.,S03E12,223
- I'm a slob? - You're a slob.,S03E12,224
- You take that back! - I will not.,S03E12,225

I'm going to my room.,S03E12,227

"- No, you stop it! Turn around.",S03E12,232
- You.,S03E12,233
Okay.,S03E12,234
You want something to look at?,S03E12,235
Try this.,S03E12,236
"Ha! See, that doesn't bother me.",S03E12,237
- Now you're the clown.,S03E12,238
"- No, you're the clown.",S03E12,239
- You're the clown.,S03E12,240
- You're the clown.,S03E12,241
You don't think you're a clown?,S03E12,242
- What me to prove that you're a clown? - Fine!,S03E12,243
Look at your bed!,S03E12,244
"Yes hi, um.",S03E12,245

"Yes yes, I know I called five minutes ago.",S03E12,247
It's just.,S03E12,248
It's a.,S03E12,249
It's a very important reservation.,S03E12,250
"See, it's with my boyfriend's Mom.",S03E12,251
"Yes, the one who likes orchids.",S03E12,252
"Oh, okay, she's here.",S03E12,253
"Okay, I have to go.",S03E12,254
I'll.,S03E12,255

"Oh, Emmett and I had a big fight.",S03E12,267
Really?,S03E12,268
That's terrible.,S03E12,269
"Oh, you know what? Gabe put a lock on your bedroom door",S03E12,270
but I'll get the bolt cutters.,S03E12,271
"No, Mom, Mom, no! Mom, I'm not moving back.",S03E12,272
We worked it out.,S03E12,273
"- Oh, you did? - Yeah.",S03E12,274
I got mad because he was messing up the place.,S03E12,275
He got mad because I got mad.,S03E12,276
Then we got tired of being mad.,S03E12,277
He agreed to stop being a slob and we made chocolate toast.,S03E12,278
Oh.,S03E12,279
"Well, good for you, standing up for yourself.",S03E12,280
- Mmm. - And I'm sure Emmett,S03E12,281
will live up to his promise of not being a slob.,S03E12,282
I mean you know what they say.,S03E12,283
People change.,S03E12,284
Or is it that people never change?,S03E12,285
"Doing great, big guy.",S03E12,286
I don't know if I can do this.,S03E12,287
- Just keep coming.,S03E12,288
"- No, my knees are wobbling.",S03E12,289
Yes!,S03E12,290
"Okay, all right.",S03E12,291
"So you made it down with a roast, a ham and a chicken.",S03E12,292
You wanna try some side dishes?,S03E12,293
I'm ready to carry a real kid.,S03E12,294
What are you looking at?,S03E12,295
- Hi. - Hi!,S03E12,296
Hi.,S03E12,297
"Okay uh, two questions.",S03E12,298
Why are you carrying Gabe and.,S03E12,299
Why does that chicken have a face?,S03E12,300
"Oh, you know why?",S03E12,301
We're playing a new game.,S03E12,302
We're playing a new game called uh.,S03E12,303
Chicken drop.,S03E12,304
And he who drops the chicken must carry the victor down the stairs.,S03E12,305
We're still working out the kinks.,S03E12,306
- May I help you? - Hi.,S03E12,307
We have a reservation.,S03E12,308
"Duncan, party of two.",S03E12,309
"Sorry, I don't have you down.",S03E12,310
"What? But, um.",S03E12,311
I confirmed the reservation and then I reconfirmed.,S03E12,312
And then I reconfirmed the reconfirm.,S03E12,313
Which is basically just a long way of saying,S03E12,314
that I put a lot of work into this reservation,S03E12,315
so I want my table and I want it now!,S03E12,316
"Oh, here it is, Duncan.",S03E12,317
Shall we?,S03E12,318
So who are you again?,S03E12,319
I'm the Window Inspector from the Department of,S03E12,320
See-through Services.,S03E12,321
"Okay, I've been a building manager for 25 years,",S03E12,322
and I have never heard of that.,S03E12,323
"Well, you're hearing about it now.",S03E12,324
"All right, let's see what we got here.",S03E12,325
Oh yeah.,S03E12,326
"P87, single pane.",S03E12,327
We see a lot of these.,S03E12,328
"Okay, for the final part of my inspection",S03E12,329
I'm gonna need you to vacate the premises.,S03E12,330
I can't do that.,S03E12,331
I take the security of my building very seriously.,S03E12,332
- I have a candy bar.,S03E12,333
- Lock up when you're done.,S03E12,334
P.,S03E12,335
J.,S03E12,336
\NP.,S03E12,337
J.,S03E12,338
!.,S03E12,339
Unbelievable!,S03E12,340
He promised.,S03E12,341
Oh!,S03E12,342
"Oh, so the clown next door meant the clown next door.",S03E12,343
So how's your tea?,S03E12,344
Actually it's a little cold.,S03E12,345
"Well, I can fix that.",S03E12,346
"Um, excuse me, her tea is cold.",S03E12,347
Could you get her a fresh cup?,S03E12,348
"And make sure it's hot, like piping hot.",S03E12,349
I hear that you like orchids.,S03E12,350
I used to and then my Mother passed away.,S03E12,351
Orchids were her favorite too.,S03E12,352
And now I can't even look at one without crying.,S03E12,353
Oh my gosh.,S03E12,354
Are you okay?,S03E12,355
Yes.,S03E12,356
"Oh, my hand fell asleep.",S03E12,357
Darn it.,S03E12,358
Thank you.,S03E12,359
"- Ah ah! - What, what's wrong?",S03E12,360
I burned my tongue.,S03E12,361
Ice ice! We need ice!,S03E12,362
"Ah, ice.",S03E12,363
Is that helping?,S03E12,364
I'm stuck.,S03E12,365
You're what?,S03E12,366
I'm stuck!,S03E12,367
You're a duck? Could you sound it out?,S03E12,368
How is everything over here?,S03E12,369
"Well, Mom, I'm moving back home.",S03E12,370
Oh no.,S03E12,371
"It's such sad, unexpected news.",S03E12,372
I came back home today and the place was a mess.,S03E12,373
What was it? Unmade bed?,S03E12,374
Potato chips everywhere?,S03E12,375
How do you know about the chips?,S03E12,376
I don't.,S03E12,377
Man. And after he promised me,S03E12,378
he was going to keep the place clean.,S03E12,379
I'm never talking to that guy again.,S03E12,380
"Hey, once you get over this, you guys will be best friends again.",S03E12,381
I don't think so.,S03E12,382
"I mean, really I could have dealt with the mess.",S03E12,383
But he looked me right in the eye and said he didn't do it.,S03E12,384
Best friends don't lie to each other.,S03E12,385
I'm gonna go put my stuff away.,S03E12,386
P.,S03E12,387
J.,S03E12,388
", wait.",S03E12,389
Emmett didn't mess up your apartment.,S03E12,390
I did.,S03E12,391
What?,S03E12,392
Why would you do that?,S03E12,393
Because I thought you weren't ready to live on your own.,S03E12,394
And.,S03E12,395
The truth is.,S03E12,396
I'm the one who's not ready.,S03E12,397
"But, Mom, I'm 18.",S03E12,398
I'm an adult now.,S03E12,399
But you're still my little boy.,S03E12,400
You'll always be my little boy.,S03E12,401
You're a good Mom.,S03E12,402
I know.,S03E12,403
A good Mom who broke into my apartment and trashed it.,S03E12,404
I know.,S03E12,405
"How you feeling, Dad?",S03E12,406
Good good.,S03E12,407
"- Yeah! - Yes, I did it!",S03E12,408
- I did it! - Nice! What were you so worried about?,S03E12,409
I don't know.,S03E12,410
It was a piece of cake.,S03E12,411
- Where are you going? - To get a piece of cake.,S03E12,412
A guy's gotta celebrate.,S03E12,413
"Oh hey, thank you.",S03E12,414
So much for getting me through this.,S03E12,415
You real.,S03E12,416
No!,S03E12,417
No!,S03E12,418
"Hey, honey.",S03E12,419
"You dropped the baby again, didn't you, Bob?",S03E12,420
What?,S03E12,421
"Well, Charlie, um, I went to tea with Spencer's Mom.",S03E12,422
And we had so much fun.,S03E12,423
We decided to keep that party going.,S03E12,424
In the emergency room.,S03E12,425
"Yeah, I don't think Mrs.",S03E12,426
Walsh will be talking to me anytime soon.,S03E12,427
Or to anyone.,S03E12,428
What.,S03E12,429
"Dad, what are you doing?",S03E12,430
Taking Toby for a walk.,S03E12,431
That doesn't really look like a walk.,S03E12,432
"No, it will be eventually.",S03E12,433
"Well, don't you need the diaper bag?",S03E12,434
"Aw, man!",S03E12,435
"Well, you survived him for three years, all you need is 15 more.",S03E12,436
"Good luck, Charlie.",S03E12,437
"Hi, Bob Duncan here with another amazing product",S03E12,438
that is going to make your life easier.,S03E12,439
"You have stairs, do you have a baby?",S03E12,440
"Well, how many times has this happened to you?",S03E12,441
Whoa!,S03E12,442
"Well, those days are gone.",S03E12,443
"Because the next time your baby goes flying,",S03E12,444
"he won't end up crying, thanks to the new ultra-cute.",S03E12,445
Baby Chute!,S03E12,446
That's right!,S03E12,447
Your home is going to be more safe and more fun!,S03E12,448
"And if you act now, we will also throw in the ultra-cute.",S03E12,449
Senior Chute.,S03E12,450
Woo!,S03E12,451
So what are you waiting for? Pick up that phone and call.,S03E12,452
Call right now.,S03E12,453
And if you drop the phone.,S03E12,454
We've got that covered too.,S03E12,455
"Ultra-cute Industries, a division of Famfunco International.",S03E12,456
"Not advised for babies, seniors or phones.",S03E12,457
"Hey, Dad. How was your day?",S03E13,0
Do you really want to know?,S03E13,1
"Actually, I was just being polite.",S03E13,2
It was horrible!,S03E13,3
"Oh, good.",S03E13,4
So you're gonna tell me anyway.,S03E13,5
"Toby kept me awake all night, so I was a zombie all day.",S03E13,6
"You know, I was so tired",S03E13,7
I used termite spray on a nest full of rats.,S03E13,8
Well.,S03E13,9
You'll uh.,S03E13,10
"You'll kill them tomorrow, huh, Dad?",S03E13,11
I never know what to say.,S03E13,12
"Oh, no. You know what?",S03E13,13
I think I'm just gonna lay down right here.,S03E13,14
Oh yeah.,S03E13,15
"Toby, come on.",S03E13,16
Work with me here. Please?,S03E13,17
Help a mother out.,S03E13,18
Guess who missed his nap?,S03E13,19
And guess who took an extra long one?,S03E13,20
Check it out.,S03E13,21
I just joined the marching band.,S03E13,22
Gabe! Gabe!,S03E13,23
Gabe!,S03E13,24
- What?  - Take it outside.,S03E13,25
"No, Mrs.",S03E13,26
Dabney just told me to take it inside.,S03E13,27
Honey? Honey? Here's some mail for PJ.,S03E13,28
Maybe you could take it to his apartment tomorrow?,S03E13,29
- How about if I do it now?  - Okay.,S03E13,30
This is so great.,S03E13,31
Hang on.,S03E13,32
I'll get my baton.,S03E13,33
Today's all burnt toast,S03E13,34
Running late and Dad jokes.,S03E13,35
Has anybody seen my left shoe?,S03E13,36
"I close my eyes, take a bite.",S03E13,37
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S03E13,38
There it is up on the roof.,S03E13,39
"I've been there, I survived.",S03E13,40
So just take my advice.,S03E13,41
"Hang in there, baby",S03E13,42
Things are crazy,S03E13,43
But I know your future's bright.,S03E13,44
"Hang in there, baby",S03E13,45
There's no maybe,S03E13,46
Everything turns out all right.,S03E13,47
Sure life is up and down.,S03E13,48
"But trust me, it comes back around.",S03E13,49
You're gonna love who you turn out to be.,S03E13,50
"Hang in there, baby.",S03E13,51
"Hey, thanks for coming to my volleyball game.",S03E13,52
Oh yeah.,S03E13,53
My pleasure.,S03E13,54
Getting to see all those cute guys,S03E13,55
running around in tight shirts and shorts.,S03E13,56
But mostly you.,S03E13,57
I focused on you.,S03E13,58
"Well, it was an awesome game.",S03E13,59
"I'm telling you, the team's really coming together this year.",S03E13,60
"Yeah? Yeah, it must be really fun to be a part of a team.",S03E13,61
You know what's kind of sad?,S03E13,62
This is my last year of high school and I've never played a sport.,S03E13,63
Oh well.,S03E13,64
You know what? I'll join the girls' volleyball team.,S03E13,65
"You're gonna play volleyball? Look, it's not that easy.",S03E13,66
"Well, how hard could it be? You do it.",S03E13,67
"It's very difficult, all right? I just make it look easy.",S03E13,68
Kind of like being your boyfriend.,S03E13,69
Oh oh oh!,S03E13,70
"Oh, yes! All day long!",S03E13,71
I got it.,S03E13,72

Emmett and PJ's World O' Fun?,S03E13,77
"So, what brings you to our place to be named later?",S03E13,78
I brought you some mail.,S03E13,79
Hey! You got chairs.,S03E13,80
"Oh, yeah.",S03E13,81
Quite the change from Casa De Drums and Screaming Kids.,S03E13,82
"Oh, let's go with World O' Fun, they're already using Casa De.",S03E13,83
"You know, it's not always this quiet here, Mr.",S03E13,84
Duncan.,S03E13,85
"We're right next door to a fire station, so we get a lot of sirens.",S03E13,86
"So, does a siren go off every hour of the night because it's hungry?",S03E13,87
Does a siren need to be burped and changed?,S03E13,88
"You don't know a lot about sirens, do you?",S03E13,89
"Well, Dad, um, thanks for stopping by.",S03E13,90
"It, uh.",S03E13,91
Dad?,S03E13,92
I think he's asleep.,S03E13,93
And he's sitting on the remote. How are we gonna change the channel?,S03E13,94
- I got an idea.  - What's that?,S03E13,95
Uh.,S03E13,96

- Yup.,S03E13,106
"Hey, Mom? I need some help with my science project.",S03E13,107
Where's Dad?,S03E13,108
"Uh, hello?",S03E13,109
Why don't you want my help?,S03E13,110
"Come on, Gabe.",S03E13,111
I'm great at science.,S03E13,112
And it sounds like fun.,S03E13,113
Helping me with a science project sounds fun?,S03E13,114
I'm covered in spit-up.,S03E13,115
"Work with me, here.",S03E13,116
All right.,S03E13,117
I'll give you a shot.,S03E13,118
Great.,S03E13,119
"And just so we're clear, I'm not gonna let you trick me",S03E13,120
into doing all the work like you do with Dad.,S03E13,121
"For your information, Dad enjoys being tricked.",S03E13,122
It's part of the dance we do.,S03E13,123
"All right, what's the project?",S03E13,124
Building a model rocket to launch at the science fair.,S03E13,125
Ooh.,S03E13,126
Fun.,S03E13,127
- When's it due?  - Two days.,S03E13,128
Two days?!,S03E13,129
Why did you wait until the last minute?,S03E13,130
"Well, that's when Dad does his best work.",S03E13,131
That's true.,S03E13,132
"Listen up, everybody.",S03E13,133
I want you to meet the newest member of our team.,S03E13,134
"- Hi, everybody.",S03E13,135
I'm Teddy.,S03E13,136
- Wrong.,S03E13,137
"No, I'm pretty sure.",S03E13,138
Teddy's too soft.,S03E13,139
It's too nice.,S03E13,140
"From now on, your volleyball name is uh.",S03E13,141
T-Rex!,S03E13,142
Keep stretching.,S03E13,143
I'm gonna get a fresh whistle.,S03E13,144
Coach likes to give us all fierce dinosaur nicknames,S03E13,145
that go with the first letter of our name.,S03E13,146
"I'm Vonnie, so I'm Velociraptor,",S03E13,147
"Stephanie's stegosaurus,",S03E13,148
Taylor's pterodactyl.,S03E13,149
But pterodactyl begins with a P.,S03E13,150
Tell it to the coach.,S03E13,151
He loves to be corrected.,S03E13,152
"All right, let's get to work.",S03E13,153
"I'm sorry, I thought you were gonna get that.",S03E13,154
Way to go.,S03E13,155
Nice shot.,S03E13,156
That was awesome.,S03E13,157
"Oh, are you okay?",S03E13,158
"That was mine, wasn't it?",S03E13,159
That's it.,S03E13,160
Practice is over.,S03E13,161
"Except for you, T-Rex.",S03E13,162
I want to talk to you in private.,S03E13,163
You stink.,S03E13,164
"Coach, I don't think we're in private yet.",S03E13,165
And do you know why you stink?,S03E13,166
No.,S03E13,167
"When I ask a question, I don't want an answer, do you understand me?",S03E13,168
I don't know what to do.,S03E13,169
You're too nice.,S03E13,170
"Nice people, they get pushed around.",S03E13,171
"And I'm not talking about volleyball, I'm talking about life.",S03E13,172
- It's just my first day.,S03E13,173
- And possibly your last.,S03E13,174
"Now, if you want to stay on my team,",S03E13,175
you need to come back tomorrow and play with some fire.,S03E13,176
- You got it?  - Got it.,S03E13,177
"Oh, and one more thing.",S03E13,178
Pterodactyl actually starts with a P.,S03E13,179
"I know that it's kind of confusing, but it's.",S03E13,180
Get out of here!,S03E13,181
See? Isn't this nice? Working on a project together.,S03E13,182
Nice? It's great.,S03E13,183
It doesn't even feel like homework.,S03E13,184
"It's more like home play, or home joy, or",S03E13,185
Too much?,S03E13,186
Okay.,S03E13,187
"Hey, Charlie. What do you want?",S03E13,188
Oh.,S03E13,189
"I forgot, I totally promised Charlie I was gonna play with her.",S03E13,190
"Charlie, I'm sorry I can't play with you.",S03E13,191
"Look, I know you've been feeling neglected",S03E13,192
"ever since Toby came along,",S03E13,193
but I'm working on a big school project with Mom.,S03E13,194
"Oh, you know, go play with her for a few minutes.",S03E13,195
I'll just get this started.,S03E13,196
If you say so.,S03E13,197
Where's my toy?,S03E13,198
- Just like we talked about.,S03E13,199
- Thank you.,S03E13,200
"All right, now, let's head down to the basement",S03E13,201
"where you're gonna play sit quietly,",S03E13,202
while I play watch TV.,S03E13,203
And then he said that I stink because I'm too nice.,S03E13,204
- You know this is all your fault.  - How is it my fault?,S03E13,205
You're the one who wanted to join a team.,S03E13,206
"Well, you could have mentioned that the coach was a lunatic.",S03E13,207
You know what? I don't need this.,S03E13,208
I'm gonna quit.,S03E13,209
"Well, I thought you wanted to play a sport.",S03E13,210
"Yeah, well there's plenty of other sports out there.",S03E13,211
"I'll do the one with the, um",S03E13,212
With the the ball and the stick and the helmet.,S03E13,213
"Okay, so that would be either Softball, Field Hockey, or Lacrosse.",S03E13,214
- Which one's outdoors?  - All of them are.,S03E13,215
- Which one has the cutest uniforms?  - None of them do.,S03E13,216
Sports is so hard.,S03E13,217
- Gentlemen.,S03E13,218
"- Hey, Dad.",S03E13,219

"Oh, I, uh.",S03E13,221
Brought you a little housewarming gift.,S03E13,222
Vacuum bags.,S03E13,223

"Well, Dad, it was nice of you to Take off your coat and stay.",S03E13,225
I also brought.,S03E13,226
This awesome Japanese monster movie.,S03E13,227
Your Mom hates it when I watch these at home.,S03E13,228
Put it in the thing.,S03E13,229
Um.,S03E13,230
"You know, actually, Dad, we're kind of busy.",S03E13,231
That's all right.,S03E13,232
Don't worry about it.,S03E13,233
You're not gonna bother me.,S03E13,234
"Just another peaceful day in Tokyo, huh?",S03E13,235
"Oh, that's gonna change.",S03E13,236
Teddy? Why are you getting home from work so late?,S03E13,237
"Well, I had a very stressful day at the library.",S03E13,238
"One of the patrons was talking, and I was gonna say something,",S03E13,239
but I didn't want to be mean.,S03E13,240
"Then my boss got mad at me, so I hid in the stacks and cried.",S03E13,241
"Teddy, you gotta stop letting people walk all over you.",S03E13,242
- Yeah. - What are you standing there for?,S03E13,243

Get the door first.,S03E13,246
- Mr.,S03E13,247
Hammerstone? - Look at you.,S03E13,248
"Because you quit the team, people walked all over you the rest of your life.",S03E13,249
I told you so.,S03E13,250
I told you so.,S03E13,251
I told you so.,S03E13,252
Can I use your bathroom?,S03E13,253
- Sure.,S03E13,254

That's it.,S03E13,256
I am done being nice.,S03E13,257
Aw.,S03E13,258
No!,S03E13,259
"Hey, honey. How'd you sleep?",S03E13,260
Lousy.,S03E13,261
"And if that doesn't sound nice, then too bad.",S03E13,262
"Well, someone's in a mood.",S03E13,263
Got a problem with that?,S03E13,264
"Um, Teddy? Sweetheart, um, are you okay?",S03E13,265
"Because you just seem, I don't know, completely different?",S03E13,266
What? Do you want some of this?,S03E13,267
Come again?,S03E13,268
"Well, you know whether or not you want it.",S03E13,269
I'm not going to give it to you.,S03E13,270
That's what I thought.,S03E13,271
"Gabe, honey?",S03E13,272
I'm gonna say something to you I have never said before.,S03E13,273
"Right now, you're my favorite.",S03E13,274
Feels good.,S03E13,275
Don't get used to it.,S03E13,276
- Hey.,S03E13,277

How did you get in here?,S03E13,279
Locksmith let me in.,S03E13,280
He let you into our apartment without our permission?,S03E13,281
Locksmiths and exterminators are brothers.,S03E13,282
"Yeah, we're like cops and firefighters.",S03E13,283
Just a little less heroic.,S03E13,284
"Hey, you know what? I got you a present.",S03E13,285
And you're welcome.,S03E13,286
A vacuum cleaner.,S03E13,287
Yay.,S03E13,288
"Uh, so.",S03E13,289
"Dad, um, how much longer are you.",S03E13,290
Oh.,S03E13,291

- Don't worry.,S03E13,295
He.,S03E13,296
He won't stay long.,S03E13,297
You know what? I was thinking about getting you guys a sofa bed.,S03E13,298
"You know, so that when I'm here late and you want me to stay over?",S03E13,299
Now.,S03E13,300
Got an idea.,S03E13,301
"So, he likes it here because it's quiet, right?",S03E13,302
- Right.,S03E13,303
- Watch this.,S03E13,304

Mind if I take the new vacuum for a little test run?,S03E13,306
Go ahead.,S03E13,307
Okay.,S03E13,308
Just my luck.,S03E13,309
The shush vac.,S03E13,310

"Well, I just don't feel like I'm cleaning unless I hear that sound.",S03E13,318
Is.,S03E13,319
Is that bothering you?.,S03E13,320
No.,S03E13,321
Still quieter than home.,S03E13,322
Ah.,S03E13,323
Mom.,S03E13,324
What did you do to my rocket?,S03E13,325
"Well, uh, first, I built it.",S03E13,326
And then I made it purty.,S03E13,327
Feathers? Why'd you have to add feathers?,S03E13,328
"Oh, that was Charlie's special touch.",S03E13,329
We also named it.,S03E13,330
Say hello.,S03E13,331
To Rainbow Sunshine.,S03E13,332
I can't take that to school.,S03E13,333
"Well, I guess you could always redecorate it yourself.",S03E13,334
You mean.,S03E13,335
Work on my own project?,S03E13,336
Has it really come to that?,S03E13,337
I'm afraid so.,S03E13,338
It was a good run.,S03E13,339
Duncan.,S03E13,340
I didn't think you'd come back.,S03E13,341
Did you sleep on what I said?,S03E13,342
"Oh, I slept on it, dreamt it, chewed it up, and spit it out.",S03E13,343
"All right, Dinos, listen up.",S03E13,344
We're gonna scrimmage the boys' team today.,S03E13,345
Yeah!,S03E13,346
"Whatever scrimmage means, bring it!",S03E13,347
Thought you were quitting.,S03E13,348
What? You're trying to get in my head?,S03E13,349
Or you afraid to lose to a bunch of girls?,S03E13,350
You trash talk your boyfriend?,S03E13,351
I'm so gonna do that as soon as I learn how to trash talk.,S03E13,352
- And get a boyfriend.,S03E13,353
- Oh yeah.,S03E13,354
"Got lucky, punks.",S03E13,355
"Oh, sweetums! Oh.",S03E13,356
I think you broke my nose.,S03E13,357
"T-Rex, let me get in there.",S03E13,358
Oh!,S03E13,359
"Oh, my nose!",S03E13,360
She broke my nose too.,S03E13,361
"Oh, I'm so sorry.",S03E13,362
I didn't.,S03E13,363
It was an accident.,S03E13,364
They were both accidents.,S03E13,365
"Sweet mother, I created a monster!",S03E13,366
No.,S03E13,367
"Guys, come on.",S03E13,368
I'm not a monster.,S03E13,369
I'm not a monster.,S03E13,370
Does anyone know when Field Hockey try-outs are?,S03E13,371
All right.,S03E13,372
All right.,S03E13,373
"All right, I'm done!",S03E13,374
Come on.,S03E13,375
- Wow. - What do you think?,S03E13,376
You ruined it.,S03E13,377
Rainbow Sunshine is now.,S03E13,378
Black Night Doom Missile Terror Fireball.,S03E13,379
"All right, let's do a test launch.",S03E13,380
"Okay, whoa.",S03E13,381
"Before you do, I've prepared a few words.",S03E13,382
Oh boy.,S03E13,383
"From the beginning of time, man looked to the heavens and said.",S03E13,384
'Stupid birds! How come they get to fly and we don't?',S03E13,385
"- I'm pushing the button. - No, no, no!",S03E13,386
I haven't gotten to my favorite part.,S03E13,387
"Wait, wait, wait.",S03E13,388
"Three, two, one.",S03E13,389
Blast off.,S03E13,390
"Yeah, that's some fireball.",S03E13,391
- Hey.,S03E13,392

What are you doing out here?,S03E13,394
"Uh, we need to talk.",S03E13,395
"Okay, but can we do it over at your place?",S03E13,396
Because I'm way more comfortable over there.,S03E13,397
Actually.,S03E13,398
"Actually, let's do it here. Okay?",S03E13,399
Okay.,S03E13,400
"Wow, this is really hard.",S03E13,401
I.,S03E13,402
Don't really know how to do this.,S03E13,403
"Well, PJ, if it's hard to say, just say it fast.",S03E13,404
It's like.,S03E13,405
Like tearing off a bandage.,S03E13,406
All right.,S03E13,407
Here goes.,S03E13,408
Idon'twantyoutohangoutatmyplacesomuch.,S03E13,409
You might want to tear that a little slower.,S03E13,410
I.,S03E13,411
- Don't.,S03E13,412
- Little little.,S03E13,413
Little faster.,S03E13,414
I don't want you to hang out at my place so much.,S03E13,415
"Look, I'm sorry, Dad, but I moved out of",S03E13,416
the house so I could be on my own.,S03E13,417
Kind of hard to do that when you're always there.,S03E13,418
I see.,S03E13,419
You mad at me?,S03E13,420
No.,S03E13,421
- Okay.,S03E13,422
- No.,S03E13,423
"No, come on, you're absolutely right.",S03E13,424
It's your place.,S03E13,425
You don't want your old man hanging out there all the time.,S03E13,426
"No, I do not.",S03E13,427
I mean.,S03E13,428
I mean.,S03E13,429
Thanks for understanding.,S03E13,430
"Oh, I'm gonna miss your place.",S03E13,431
Because let me tell you something.,S03E13,432
Around here?,S03E13,433
It always feels like there's something crazy going on.,S03E13,434
Oh.,S03E13,435
"Mom, I think I found the problem.",S03E13,436
Loose wires.,S03E13,437
Well dude.,S03E13,438
Stick em together.,S03E13,439
- Was that a rocket? - Yup.,S03E13,440
"Come over any time, Dad.",S03E13,441
- How about now? - Let's go.,S03E13,442
"Hey, Charlie.",S03E13,443
"So, big news.",S03E13,444
Looks like I'm staying on the volleyball team.,S03E13,445
"You know, after they make a few minor repairs to the gym.",S03E13,446
Speaking of minor repairs.,S03E13,447
So this is what happens if you let Mom help you with a school project.,S03E13,448
"Okay, it was not my fault.",S03E13,449
Really? Because Gabe said you uttered the words.,S03E13,450
"Dude, stick em together.",S03E13,451
I don't recall exactly what I uttered.,S03E13,452
Okay.,S03E13,453
"Well, consider yourself warned.",S03E13,454
If you ever allow Mom to help you with a science project.,S03E13,455
"Good luck, Charlie.",S03E13,456
"Fly, rocket.",S03E13,457
Fly high.,S03E13,458
"Hey, hon.",S03E13,459
Bob?,S03E13,460
What are you doing here?,S03E13,461
"Oh, PJ and Emmett kicked me out.",S03E13,462
So I'm just looking for a little peace and quiet.,S03E13,463
"Well, you're crowding me.",S03E13,464
Get lost.,S03E13,465
I'm crowding you?,S03E13,466
In outer space?,S03E13,467
"Oh, would you just leave?",S03E13,468
"Honey, I'm floating.",S03E13,469
It's not like I can steer the chair.,S03E13,470
"Oh, well let me help you out.",S03E13,471
Hey.,S03E13,472
Whoa whoa whoa!.,S03E13,473
Fly chair.,S03E13,474

Listen up.,S03E14,1
Big announcement.,S03E14,2
Maternity leave is over and I'm headed back to work at the hospital.,S03E14,3
Can you take Toby with you?,S03E14,4
"Honey, I think we've been over this.",S03E14,5
Is that a yes?,S03E14,6
"All right, you two are gonna take care of the little ones on Saturday.",S03E14,7
"Teddy, you get Toby.",S03E14,8
"Aw, why can't I have Toby?",S03E14,9
Remember what happened the last time I put you in charge of a baby?,S03E14,10
"Man, you lose one kid.",S03E14,11
You get labeled for life.,S03E14,12
You and Gabe can take care of Charlie.,S03E14,13
What about Dad?,S03E14,14
Or don't you trust old butterfingers?,S03E14,15
Man. You drop two babies,S03E14,16
I just remembered I have the student UN on Saturday.,S03E14,17
- It's at noon.,S03E14,18
"- Oh, that's not a problem.",S03E14,19
I only work half a day.,S03E14,20
You know what? I'll meet you at the,S03E14,21
"high school, we'll do a Toby hand off.",S03E14,22
"- Great, then we're all set.",S03E14,23
"- Wow, mom.",S03E14,24
Now that you're going back to work I guess this is our last,S03E14,25
"Amy Duncan home cooked breakfast, huh?",S03E14,26
"I'm afraid so, honey.",S03E14,27
I know what you're all doing.,S03E14,28
Today's all burnt toast ,S03E14,29
"Running late, and dad jokes",S03E14,30
Has anybody seen my left shoe?,S03E14,31
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S03E14,32
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S03E14,33
There it is up on the roof.,S03E14,34
"I've been there, I survived.",S03E14,35
So just take my advice.,S03E14,36
"Hang in there, baby",S03E14,37
Things are crazy,S03E14,38
But I know your future's bright.,S03E14,39
"Hang in there, baby, there's no maybe.",S03E14,40
Everything turns out all right.,S03E14,41
Sure life is up and down.,S03E14,42
"But trust me, it comes back around.",S03E14,43
You're gonna love who you turn out to be.,S03E14,44
"Hang in there, baby.",S03E14,45
There he is.,S03E14,46
Mr.,S03E14,47
Victor Deleseur.,S03E14,48
Two-time winner of the South High student U.,S03E14,49
N.,S03E14,50
Three-time.,S03E14,51
"Hello, Teddy.",S03E14,52
Why'd you want to see me?,S03E14,53
"Well, I was saddened to hear that you and Victoria broke up.",S03E14,54
She said I wasn't romantic enough.,S03E14,55
Which is totally untrue.,S03E14,56
I did an algorithm which proved my romanticism is above average.,S03E14,57
"Anyway, um",S03E14,58
Since you and Victoria are no longer together I,S03E14,59
"Uh, stop.",S03E14,60
"Before you get your hopes up,",S03E14,61
I'm not ready to start another relationship.,S03E14,62
It's too soon.,S03E14,63
"Really? Okay, um",S03E14,64
Give me a moment to regroup,S03E14,65
Done.,S03E14,66
"Anyways, um",S03E14,67
I was wondering if you actually wanted to,S03E14,68
be my partner for the student U.,S03E14,69
N.,S03E14,70
"Ah, so you'd like to win the award you lose every year.",S03E14,71
"Well, that's not all of it.",S03E14,72
"Because the award will look good on your college applications,",S03E14,73
and help you get into a better school.,S03E14,74
Yeah.,S03E14,75
That's all of it.,S03E14,76
Attention everyone.,S03E14,77
I'm back!,S03E14,78
Yeah!,S03E14,79
"Thank you, thank you, thank you.",S03E14,80
You guys can go pick up that corpse now.,S03E14,81
Oh! Karen.,S03E14,82
"Hello, Duncan.",S03E14,83
Hi.,S03E14,84
I thought you gave up nursing after you got married.,S03E14,85
"Yeah, well, I'm not married any more.",S03E14,86
"He said I was loud and bossy, I think he has commitment issues.",S03E14,87
"Well, it's, uh",S03E14,88
Nice to see you again.,S03E14,89
"Is it, Duncan?",S03E14,90
Is it?,S03E14,91
Because I remember what happened,S03E14,92
the last time we were in this room together.,S03E14,93
Do you?,S03E14,94
I believe I resigned due to a temporary misunderstanding.,S03E14,95
You popped one of these saline bags and squirted it in my face!,S03E14,96
"Tomato, to-mah-to.",S03E14,97
"I'm keeping my eye on you, Duncan.",S03E14,98
I've had a lot of problems with nurses returning from maternity leave.,S03E14,99
You're not gonna be all like wah wah wah I miss my baby.,S03E14,100
Are you?,S03E14,101
Of course not.,S03E14,102
Good.,S03E14,103
I'm gonna be all wah wah wah,S03E14,104
I can't believe I have to work with you again.,S03E14,105
"Now, here is our presentation.",S03E14,106
"And since we're Italy, I decided to draw a nice little",S03E14,107
map of our nation on the cover.,S03E14,108
"Oh, good.",S03E14,109
That's Italy.,S03E14,110
I was afraid you were drawing some boots that you wanted.,S03E14,111
"Look, I don't draw boots.",S03E14,112
I'm not that shallow.,S03E14,113
Okay.,S03E14,114
All right.,S03E14,115
Let's go.,S03E14,116
Why are you taking the baby?,S03E14,117
Don't worry. My Dad's gonna meet me at school,S03E14,118
and we're gonna do a hand off.,S03E14,119
Like in football.,S03E14,120
"Anyway, it'll be fine.",S03E14,121
"Toby's such a sweet little boy, we won't even know he's there.",S03E14,122
Hush little baby don't say a word.,S03E14,123
Why are you singing? The child is obviously in distress.,S03E14,124
Papa's gonna buy you a mockingbird.,S03E14,125
See?,S03E14,126
Amazing.,S03E14,127
Lullabies were forbidden in my house.,S03E14,128
My mother would only allow me to listen to 18th century Italian operas.,S03E14,129
"Oh, so that's why you turned out to be",S03E14,130
The way that you are.,S03E14,131
You've been arrested by a Sheriff Kitty.,S03E14,132
Go to the dog pound.,S03E14,133
I don't get it.,S03E14,134
The game's called puppy town. But the Sheriff's a cat?,S03E14,135
Okay.,S03E14,136
Ah.,S03E14,137
"You win again, Charlie.",S03E14,138
The 10th straight time.,S03E14,139
- Play again? -No no no no no no.,S03E14,140

Let's do something else. Want to read a book?,S03E14,143
Okay.,S03E14,144
Return to puppy town.,S03E14,145
My phone's upstairs.,S03E14,146
Hang on.,S03E14,147
Gabe? It's your turn to watch Charlie.,S03E14,148
Just a minute!,S03E14,149
What'd you say?,S03E14,150
Eh.,S03E14,151
Charlie?,S03E14,152
Did you run away?,S03E14,153
"Because if you did, I don't blame you.",S03E14,154
Want to play?,S03E14,155
"Oh, puppy town, huh?",S03E14,156
I used to play with my son Rodney.,S03E14,157
"I have to warn you, I'm pretty good.",S03E14,158
Me too.,S03E14,159
"Okay, hotshot.",S03E14,160
"And this is my baby, Toby.",S03E14,161
Isn't he adorable?,S03E14,162
"Oh, you know what would be adorable?",S03E14,163
Doing your job!,S03E14,164
You don't see me going around showing everyone pictures of my plant.,S03E14,165
A plant.,S03E14,166
How wise of you to get something that can't run away.,S03E14,167
Note to self:,S03E14,168
"Take picture of plant, make people look at it.",S03E14,169
"Okay, I'm just going to check your blood pressure, Mr.",S03E14,170
Franklin.,S03E14,171
You can call me Toby.,S03E14,172
"Oh, Toby.",S03E14,173
That's my baby's name.,S03E14,174
"Well, what do you know about that.",S03E14,175
"Today's my first day back at work, and I just miss him so much.",S03E14,176
"Oh, Toby.",S03E14,177
- You're hurting me.,S03E14,178
"-Oh, no, sweetie.",S03E14,179
I would never hurt you.,S03E14,180
Mama loves you.,S03E14,181
"Hey, I can't feel my arm.",S03E14,182
What?,S03E14,183
I'm sorry.,S03E14,184
"I'm sorry, Mr.",S03E14,185
Franklin.,S03E14,186
I'm just having a little trouble focusing today.,S03E14,187
"That's okay, dear.",S03E14,188
"You work in a hospital, no need to focus on your job.",S03E14,189
Thank you for understanding.,S03E14,190
What you reading?,S03E14,191
Return to puppy town.,S03E14,192
"You know, I can't get past Sheriff Kitty.",S03E14,193
"I mean, why would dogs obey a cat?",S03E14,194
Thank you.,S03E14,195
Okay.,S03E14,196
"So, where's Charlie?",S03E14,197
That's funny.,S03E14,198
I'll do it.,S03E14,199
"So, where's Charlie?",S03E14,200
I thought she was with you.,S03E14,201
I thought she was with you.,S03E14,202
"Dude, why are you laughing?",S03E14,203
Because you're pretending you don't know where Charlie is.,S03E14,204
I don't know where Charlie is!,S03E14,205
What?,S03E14,206
-This is suddenly not funny.  -You think?,S03E14,207
"We got to find her. Uh, Charlie?",S03E14,208
- Charlie?  -Charlie?,S03E14,209
"Hey, guys.",S03E14,210
"Hey, Dad.",S03E14,211
What are you doing?,S03E14,212
Uh,S03E14,213
Playing hide-and-go-seek with Charlie.,S03E14,214
Yeah.,S03E14,215
She's very good.,S03E14,216
- You want to help us look?  - She could be anywhere in the house.,S03E14,217
Or outside.,S03E14,218
-The rules were kind of vague.,S03E14,219
-Yeah.,S03E14,220
"Oh, hey.",S03E14,221
Here's an idea.,S03E14,222
Why don't you guys go next door  and look in Mrs.,S03E14,223
Dabney's house.,S03E14,224
Do you want to know why I think you should go over and look there?,S03E14,225
Because you're not very good at this game?,S03E14,226
"No, because Mrs. Dabney called me an hour ago",S03E14,227
to tell me that Charlie had gone over there.,S03E14,228
All by herself.,S03E14,229
Oh.,S03E14,230
So,S03E14,231
"A little moment of panic, but a happy ending, huh, Dad?",S03E14,232
Go get her.,S03E14,233
"Oh, and when you guys come back we're having a little talk.",S03E14,234
Sheriff Kitty?,S03E14,235
"Well, that doesn't make any sense.",S03E14,236
- Victor.,S03E14,237
-Victoria.,S03E14,238
This is who you're partnered with?,S03E14,239
Teddy Duncan?,S03E14,240
She's academically inferior.,S03E14,241
"She's not inferior, she's marginal.",S03E14,242
"Sitting right here, guys.",S03E14,243
"Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to lead Norway to victory.",S03E14,244
Of course she would be Norway.,S03E14,245
"Cold, isolated, yet irresistible.",S03E14,246
"Dad, where are you?",S03E14,247
What?,S03E14,248
"Oh, man.",S03E14,249
Okay.,S03E14,250
"Yeah, okay.",S03E14,251
Just get here as fast as you can.,S03E14,252
"Okay, bye.",S03E14,253
Bad news.,S03E14,254
"Um, my Dad is running late,",S03E14,255
so we're kind of stuck with the baby for a little while.,S03E14,256
What? We can't give our presentation with a baby.,S03E14,257
"Okay, relax.",S03E14,258
No one will even know he's here.,S03E14,259
"Yeah, unless they have a sense of smell.",S03E14,260
"Man, Toby.",S03E14,261
Again?,S03E14,262
"All right, let me change you.",S03E14,263
Really? Right here?,S03E14,264
This is highly inappro,S03E14,265
"Victor, are you okay?",S03E14,266
Fine.,S03E14,267
Just gonna stay down here for a minute.,S03E14,268
Probably not a good idea.,S03E14,269
"Welcome to the 14th annual,",S03E14,270
South High student united nations competition.,S03E14,271
As I always say at this juncture,S03E14,272
Game on.,S03E14,273
"Yes, the chair recognizes the delegate from Norway.",S03E14,274
"Thank you, Mr.",S03E14,275
Chairman.,S03E14,276
I would like to protest the fact that the Italian delegation,S03E14,277
appears to consist of three people.,S03E14,278
The maximum allowed is two.,S03E14,279
"Italy, care to rebut?",S03E14,280
"Um, the third person is a baby.",S03E14,281
A baby is a human being.,S03E14,282
Italy has admitted to breaking the rules,S03E14,283
and should be dismissed from the proceedings.,S03E14,284
Isn't she magnificent?,S03E14,285
"Mr. Chairman, Italy is involved in some family care issues,",S03E14,286
"Italy's father promised to be here, but as we can see",S03E14,287
he has failed to cross the border.,S03E14,288
The chair understands,S03E14,289
Having dealt with Italy's parents before.,S03E14,290
Double sixes? You win again.,S03E14,291
Set em up.,S03E14,292
This isn't over.,S03E14,293
"Well, it only took you 73 minutes to",S03E14,294
realize your little sister was missing.,S03E14,295
In our defense,S03E14,296
You got anything?,S03E14,297
- Nope.,S03E14,298
-Oh.,S03E14,299
"Charlie, there you are.",S03E14,300
"Oh, playing puppy town, huh?",S03E14,301
- How you doing? - It's about even.,S03E14,302
"No, it's not.",S03E14,303
- I let her win.,S03E14,304
-She said bad words.,S03E14,305
Just take her and get out.,S03E14,306
Dr.,S03E14,307
Elliot to ICU.,S03E14,308
Dr.,S03E14,309
Elliot to ICU.,S03E14,310
"Mommy, I see you.",S03E14,311
"Mommy, I see you.",S03E14,312
Charlie?,S03E14,313
"Charlie, is that you?",S03E14,314
Who are you talking to?,S03E14,315
"Um, no one.",S03E14,316
Dr.,S03E14,317
Napier's looking for you.,S03E14,318
"Oh, and tomorrow, you're working a double.",S03E14,319
"Good for you, Karen.",S03E14,320
Way to take the reins.,S03E14,321
"Dr. Napier, you wanted to see me?",S03E14,322
"Yes, I want you to come home, mommy.",S03E14,323
"Uh, excuse me?",S03E14,324
"I miss you, mommy.",S03E14,325
You do?,S03E14,326
Can I have a hug?,S03E14,327
Of course you can.,S03E14,328
Ohh.,S03E14,329
"What are you doing, Duncan?",S03E14,330
And that is why Norway believes that the most important,S03E14,331
problem facing the world today is debt.,S03E14,332
Thank you.,S03E14,333
We will now hear from the Italian delegation.,S03E14,334
"Thank you, Mr.",S03E14,335
Chairman.,S03E14,336
Italy believes the most important issue,S03E14,337
facing the world today is the environment.,S03E14,338
Just keep going.,S03E14,339
As I was saying,S03E14,340
Do something.,S03E14,341
Make him be quiet.,S03E14,342
Only singing will do that.,S03E14,343
"What are we supposed to do, sing the presentation?",S03E14,344
"Italy, we're waiting.",S03E14,345
"Yeah, that's a great idea.",S03E14,346
Just sing it.,S03E14,347
- But I -Sing.,S03E14,348
The snow caps are melting.,S03E14,349
From all the pollution.,S03E14,350
"Our alps, they need helping.",S03E14,351
There is a solution.,S03E14,352
"We will go, we will go, we will go.",S03E14,353
To hand our resolution in.,S03E14,354
So,S03E14,355
"You will know, you will know, you will know.",S03E14,356
"It's a fight, we truly can win.",S03E14,357
"All right, I just put Charlie down for her nap, so let's talk.",S03E14,358
How could you two be so irresponsible?,S03E14,359
"Dad, before we get into that, we made you a little something.",S03E14,360
"Oh, sweet Mama, is that a chicken Bob-pie?",S03E14,361
Mm-hmm.,S03E14,362
"Stuffed with cheddar cheese, mini hot dogs, and onion rings.",S03E14,363
And love.,S03E14,364
No.,S03E14,365
No.,S03E14,366
"Look, guys, bribery is not gonna work.",S03E14,367
I'm very disappointed in you two.,S03E14,368
"Now, I can't do everything around here.",S03E14,369
"I was supposed to be over at the high school to pick up Toby,",S03E14,370
but now I gotta deal with this.,S03E14,371
"We're sorry, Dad.",S03E14,372
I just can't believe you would let Charlie walk right out that door.,S03E14,373
"Dad, we won't let it happen again.",S03E14,374
Good.,S03E14,375
"Now if we're done, I believe there was a pie mentioned.",S03E14,376
And now the exciting moment that we've all been waiting for,S03E14,377
The winner of the 14th annual South High student U.,S03E14,378
N.,S03E14,379
competition is.,S03E14,380
"Oh, my goodness.",S03E14,381
Italy.,S03E14,382
Yes! We won!,S03E14,383
Victor?,S03E14,384
I didn't know you could sing like that.,S03E14,385
It was so romantic.,S03E14,386
Does this mean you want me back?,S03E14,387
"- Is 64 the square root of  -4,096?",S03E14,388
"Oh, darling.",S03E14,389
"Congratulations, Italy.",S03E14,390
"Wow, um",S03E14,391
"You know, I'd like to thank the little people.",S03E14,392
"And by little people, I mean Toby.",S03E14,393
"Love you, bro.",S03E14,394
"Hey, guys.",S03E14,395
"Hey, mom. What are you doing home from work so early?",S03E14,396
"Oh, I had a terrible day.",S03E14,397
I kept having these crazy hallucinations about Toby and Charlie.,S03E14,398
"In fact, they're still going on.",S03E14,399
I thought I just saw Charlie in Mrs.,S03E14,400
Dabney's window.,S03E14,401
"Well, that's crazy.",S03E14,402
Mommy!,S03E14,403
Does anyone else see her?,S03E14,404
She got out again.,S03E14,405
Some operation you're running here.,S03E14,406
But They lost her first!,S03E14,407
- What?!  -He ate three pies.,S03E14,408
- Yeah!  -Because you made them for me.,S03E14,409
Quiet everybody!,S03E14,410
"Pie boy, in the kitchen now!",S03E14,411
And you two watch your sister.,S03E14,412
"Honey honey honey, okay, look.",S03E14,413
I can explain.,S03E14,414
I know it looks bad.,S03E14,415
"Bob, I missed the kids so much today.",S03E14,416
Going back to work is so much harder than I thought.,S03E14,417
"Honey, it's just the first day.",S03E14,418
It's gonna get better.,S03E14,419
I don't know.,S03E14,420
"Bob, we have two little ones now, and they both need me so much.",S03E14,421
I just,S03E14,422
"Look, I know we need the money,",S03E14,423
but if there's a way I could stay home,S03E14,424
"Okay, all right all right, look, if this is what's best for the family.",S03E14,425
Then we'll We'll find a way.,S03E14,426
"Oh, Bob.",S03E14,427
Okay.,S03E14,428
Guess I'd better go back to the hospital and quit.,S03E14,429
- Can't you do that over the phone?  - It's Karen.,S03E14,430
I should do it in person.,S03E14,431
"Hello, Karen.",S03E14,432
- Is that for a patient? - Nope.,S03E14,433
- You quitting? -Yup.,S03E14,434
Do I have time to put on my goggles?,S03E14,435
I recently bought goggles because I had a feeling.,S03E14,436
Nope.,S03E14,437
Whoa! Oh! Oh no!,S03E14,438
Ohh,S03E14,439
"Good for you, Amy.",S03E14,440
Good for you.,S03E14,441
"Well, Charlie, it looks like mom's gonna be staying at home for a while.",S03E14,442
"And since we got new childproof locks,",S03E14,443
we are hoping you will be too.,S03E14,444
"No, but seriously, it's gonna be really great to have mom at home.",S03E14,445
"For you, and for Toby, and yeah, well, for all of us.",S03E14,446
Breakfast is ready.,S03E14,447
Better give it a minute.,S03E14,448
You're gonna be with her for three meals a day.,S03E14,449
"Good luck, Charlie.",S03E14,450
"Hello, Mrs.",S03E14,451

I've something I must say.,S03E14,453
"Then let's hear it, Victor.",S03E14,454

Since I'm back with Victoria.,S03E14,456
Teddy and I.,S03E14,457
Are no more-ia.,S03E14,458
I think you're mistaken.,S03E14,459
Teddy's already taken.,S03E14,460
Hey. What's going on?,S03E14,461
Honey don't you know?,S03E14,462
We're singing as.,S03E14,463

Little lamb.,S03E14,472
-Forget it.,S03E14,473
Forget it.,S03E14,474
"-Yeah, that was terrible.",S03E14,475
Somebody threw a ball through my window.,S03E14,476
Who's gonna fix.,S03E14,477
No no no no.,S03E14,478
We're not doing that any more.,S03E14,479
Why do I even try with you people?,S03E14,480
Uh-oh.,S03E15,0
Charlie's in a time-out.,S03E15,1
What'd she do?.,S03E15,2
She tried to give your baby brother to the mailman.,S03E15,3
Mm-hmm.,S03E15,4
Even put a stamp on his forehead.,S03E15,5
"Wait a minute, didn't PJ try to mail me?",S03E15,6
"Yes, and you tried to mail Gabe, and Gabe tried to mail Charlie.",S03E15,7
"See, these are the sweet family memories you just don't get with e-mail.",S03E15,8
Mm.,S03E15,9
Okay.,S03E15,10
"Charlie, have you learned your lesson?",S03E15,11
No.,S03E15,12
Close enough.,S03E15,13
Get outta here.,S03E15,14
Go go go.,S03E15,15
Uh Oh. Um,S03E15,16
"By the way, I was on your school website this morning,",S03E15,17
and I noticed that your volleyball team needs a team mom.,S03E15,18
Don't tell me you're thinking about calling.,S03E15,19
Called.,S03E15,20
"But you're You're not doing it, right?",S03E15,21
Doing it.,S03E15,22
Mom! Don't you think we should have had a conversation about this?,S03E15,23
Just did.,S03E15,24
What are you smiling about?,S03E15,25
It'll be your turn next.,S03E15,26
Today's all burnt toast ,S03E15,27
"Running late, and dad jokes",S03E15,28
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S03E15,29
"I close my eyes, take a bite ",S03E15,30
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S03E15,31
There it is up on the roof,S03E15,32
"I've been there, I've survived",S03E15,33
So just take my advice,S03E15,34
"Hang in there, baby ",S03E15,35
Things are crazy,S03E15,36
But I know your future's bright,S03E15,37
"Hang in there, baby ",S03E15,38
There's no maybe,S03E15,39
Everything turns out all right,S03E15,40

But trust me it comes back around,S03E15,42
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S03E15,43
"Hang in there, baby.",S03E15,44

"Oh, I got a new job at the mall.",S03E15,47
I'm a fragrance technician at Bimbel's.,S03E15,48
- Fragrance technician.,S03E15,49
- Mm-hmm.,S03E15,50
"Basically, I hold up a bottle of cologne and do this CHH.",S03E15,51
Very different from when I used to work,S03E15,52
"at Kwikki-Chikki, where I did this",S03E15,53
And this,S03E15,54
And sometimes this,S03E15,55

Zip.,S03E15,58
This is baseball.,S03E15,59
"Not my favorite sport, but when I get to watch it,",S03E15,60
I get three hours all to myself,S03E15,61
"- Hey, dad. - Yeah?",S03E15,62
There's something we need to talk about.,S03E15,63
"Oh, no.",S03E15,64
Do I have to call my lawyer?,S03E15,65
My insurance guy? Please don't say both.,S03E15,66
Don't worry.,S03E15,67
You don't have to call anybody.,S03E15,68
"Besides, trouble making was more tween Gabe's thing.",S03E15,69
I'm teen Gabe now.,S03E15,70
"Well welcome Sir, we've uh",S03E15,71
Been nervously expecting you.,S03E15,72
All right.,S03E15,73
"So, here's the thing.",S03E15,74
"Tomorrow, I need your help because",S03E15,75
I have a date.,S03E15,76
"Nice. So, who's the girl?",S03E15,77
Her name's Emma.,S03E15,78
She's new at our school.,S03E15,79
"Okay, so because she doesn't know you, she agreed to go out with you.",S03E15,80
- Exactly.,S03E15,81
- Yeah.,S03E15,82
Okay.,S03E15,83
"So, here's the plan.",S03E15,84
"You pick us up, you take us to the theater,",S03E15,85
and you sit as far away from us as possible.,S03E15,86
Questions?,S03E15,87
Can I speak to her?,S03E15,88
"Uh, yes.",S03E15,89
I have taken the liberty of preparing some small talk for you.,S03E15,90
Hello.,S03E15,91
I'm Bob.,S03E15,92
Good-bye.,S03E15,93
"You know, now that I'm hearing it out loud",S03E15,94
We may not need I'm Bob.,S03E15,95
"Hey, Emmett. How's the road trip to Death Valley?",S03E15,96
You ran out of gas?,S03E15,97
That can't be good.,S03E15,98
Vultures?,S03E15,99
That can't be good.,S03E15,100
Emmett.,S03E15,101
"Dude, Emmett.",S03E15,102
You're not gonna believe this.,S03E15,103
I think the clown moved out,S03E15,104
because there's a really cute girl in that apartment.,S03E15,105
"Well, you can't call dibs!",S03E15,106
We're not even sure if you're coming back.,S03E15,107
"Sorry, dude.",S03E15,108
I'm making my move.,S03E15,109
Yeah.,S03E15,110
"Up, and down.",S03E15,111
"Up, and down.",S03E15,112
Up,S03E15,113
And down.,S03E15,114
I hear this movie is pretty good.,S03E15,115
"Yeah, me too.",S03E15,116
"Yeah, me too? That's all you got?",S03E15,117
I should have written out some cards for myself.,S03E15,118
Oh.,S03E15,119
"Great, thanks.",S03E15,120
My daughter's on a date with a kid,S03E15,121
And I'm keeping an eye on them.,S03E15,122
You know what?,S03E15,123
I think that's my kid she's on the date with.,S03E15,124
"- Bob Duncan. - Randy Schleebee, how you doing?",S03E15,125
I'm good.,S03E15,126
Have some popcorn.,S03E15,127
Hmm? Thanks.,S03E15,128
Have all the popcorn.,S03E15,129
Whoa.,S03E15,130
Salty.,S03E15,131
Yuck.,S03E15,132
Root beer.,S03E15,133
My bad.,S03E15,134
"Oh, it's starting.",S03E15,135
"Man, I can't believe we lost again.",S03E15,136
What do you think the problem is?,S03E15,137
The other team scored more points than us.,S03E15,138
"- Um, I have an idea. - Mm!",S03E15,139
Nope.,S03E15,140
"Mom, remember we made an agreement.",S03E15,141
"As team mom, you can only answer questions about snacks and schedules.",S03E15,142
We even put this in writing.,S03E15,143
"Well, if she gives advice as awesomely as she slices oranges,",S03E15,144
maybe she's got something.,S03E15,145
I like this girl.,S03E15,146
"Okay, ladies.",S03E15,147
Listen up.,S03E15,148
I've got a story for you.,S03E15,149
"Oh, just so long as it's not one of your college stories.",S03E15,150
- When I was in college - Here we go.,S03E15,151
I played hockey for the Southwest Denver Community College Lady Icers.,S03E15,152
We'd lost 10 games in a row.,S03E15,153
But all that was about to change the night,S03E15,154
"that we played our arch rival,",S03E15,155
the Northeast Pueblo Community College Lady Checkers.,S03E15,156
This is time you're never gonna get back.,S03E15,157
"Now, because of a terrible blizzard, we had to stay in a motel.",S03E15,158
Best thing that ever happened to us.,S03E15,159
We all got to know each other and we really bonded.,S03E15,160
And you know what happened at the next game?,S03E15,161
"No, but I'm on the edge of my seat.",S03E15,162
One of their players tripped me from behind,S03E15,163
And our entire team jumped that girl,S03E15,164
and cross-checked the daylights out of her.,S03E15,165
Ba-bam!,S03E15,166
It was so touching.,S03E15,167
"To recap, your advice is that we attack someone?",S03E15,168
"Well, not at first.",S03E15,169
No no no.,S03E15,170
I'm saying that you invite the team over for a slumber party.,S03E15,171
- So you guys can all bond.,S03E15,172
- I love parties.,S03E15,173
And I just got a new sleeping bag!,S03E15,174
"Okay, you are way too perky.",S03E15,175
Looks like we're having a sleepover.,S03E15,176
"Yes, in my new sleeping bag!",S03E15,177
"Seriously, just dial it down.",S03E15,178
- What a day.,S03E15,179
- What a day.,S03E15,180
- She sat so close.,S03E15,181
- He sat so close.,S03E15,182
- Our hands touched. - Our hands touched!,S03E15,183
"Wait, what are you talking about?",S03E15,184
Emma's dad.,S03E15,185
What a total nightmare.,S03E15,186
I never want to see him again.,S03E15,187
"Dad, who says you have to?",S03E15,188
"Just because I'm hanging out with Emma doesn't mean that,",S03E15,189
you have to do stuff with her dad.,S03E15,190
Really? I don't think Randy feels the same way.,S03E15,191
What do you mean?,S03E15,192
Because he wrote his phone number on my hand.,S03E15,193
Home.,S03E15,194
And cell.,S03E15,195
Hey.,S03E15,196
- I'm Molly.,S03E15,197
- I'm PJ.,S03E15,198
Welcome to the neighborhood.,S03E15,199
I didn't know I was living across from a doctor.,S03E15,200
"Oh, you are?",S03E15,201
I was talking about you.,S03E15,202
I saw your coat.,S03E15,203
"Oh. Oh, you think",S03E15,204
It's so impressive that someone so young could be a doctor.,S03E15,205
I've worked really hard.,S03E15,206
So what's your specialty?,S03E15,207
My specialty? I uh,S03E15,208
Make people smell better.,S03E15,209
"Oh, so you're an ear, nose, and throat guy?",S03E15,210
Mostly nose.,S03E15,211
"I'd say it's 50% nose, 30% ear, 30% throat.",S03E15,212
That's 110%.,S03E15,213
That's just how much I give.,S03E15,214
"So what do you do, Molly?",S03E15,215
"Oh, uh, I'm a college student.",S03E15,216
"Well, it was nice meeting you, PJ.",S03E15,217
"You know, actually Um.",S03E15,218
"I, uh",S03E15,219
I'm cooking dinner tonight if you want to come over.,S03E15,220
The diagnosis is meatloaf.,S03E15,221
"Hey, girls. How's the bonding going?",S03E15,222
Okay.,S03E15,223
I see what the problem is.,S03E15,224
Put your phones in the basket.,S03E15,225
Good.,S03E15,226
Dump it.,S03E15,227
In.,S03E15,228
"Aw, man.",S03E15,229
Teddy.,S03E15,230
"Vonnie, you too.",S03E15,231
- What if my boyfriend calls? - You have a boyfriend now?,S03E15,232
Here.,S03E15,233
"Okay, girls.",S03E15,234
Forget about your phones.,S03E15,235
"Okay, everybody.",S03E15,236
We're gonna do a bonding exercise.,S03E15,237
"Now get up, get over there, form a circle.",S03E15,238
Let's go.,S03E15,239
"Hustle, hustle.",S03E15,240
Get a move on.,S03E15,241
Okay.,S03E15,242
Reach in the circle and grab two hands.,S03E15,243
Now the goal here is to untie the knot without letting go.,S03E15,244
"It's very difficult, but if you work together, you'll see how easy it is.",S03E15,245
Go.,S03E15,246
- Ow.,S03E15,247
Ow.,S03E15,248
- Turn this way.,S03E15,249
"- No, the other way! - Ow.",S03E15,250
"Ow, watch it!",S03E15,251
Get your butt out of my face!,S03E15,252
Get your face out of my butt.,S03E15,253
You girls have got to learn to work together.,S03E15,254
"Okay, I need a volunteer.",S03E15,255
Teddy.,S03E15,256
Everyone form a circle around Teddy.,S03E15,257
Come on.,S03E15,258
"Now, you're going to close your eyes and make your body stiff and straight.",S03E15,259
And then you're going to lean into the circle.,S03E15,260
"Now, you're gonna feel like you're falling, but you're not",S03E15,261
because your teammates are going to keep you upright.,S03E15,262
There we go.,S03E15,263
Now we're working together.,S03E15,264
"Good. How you doing, Teddy?",S03E15,265
"- You know, actually pretty good.",S03E15,266
- Good.,S03E15,267
Aah!,S03E15,268
"I have to have a phone, I'm a mom.",S03E15,269
"Hi, Gabe.",S03E15,270
Emma.,S03E15,271
I was just wondering if you wanted to go out for ice cream.,S03E15,272
- Sure.  - Why not make it a foursome?,S03E15,273
Hey.,S03E15,274
"Hey, you know where I live now.",S03E15,275
"Come on, Bobbo.",S03E15,276
We had so much fun this afternoon it'd be a crime not to keep the party going.,S03E15,277
"Yeah Oh, whoa.",S03E15,278
"Come on, Gabe. A little help?",S03E15,279
You smell like flowers.,S03E15,280
"Oh, you You know what? What am I thinking?",S03E15,281
"I can't go anywhere, I got two little ones I gotta take care of.",S03E15,282
"I hear you, Bobsled.",S03E15,283
That's a cry for help.,S03E15,284
So I'm staying right here with you.,S03E15,285
Maybe we can just have ice cream here.,S03E15,286
"Looks like the party's staying home, Bobcat.",S03E15,287
"As you can tell, I've been thinking of some nicknames for you.",S03E15,288
So you think of some names for me.,S03E15,289
"Oh, I am.",S03E15,290
"Okay, we are going to do another bonding exercise.",S03E15,291
Everyone find a partner.,S03E15,292
"Okay, good.",S03E15,293
Now I want each of you to tell your partner one thing you like about her,S03E15,294
And one thing you don't.,S03E15,295
"By the end of this, we're all gonna be very close.",S03E15,296
"Oh yeah? Yeah, my head's too big?",S03E15,297
"Well, your head is too small!",S03E15,298
I am not over dramatic!,S03E15,299
She said over dramatically.,S03E15,300
"Oh, wait a sec.",S03E15,301
My bad.,S03E15,302
This is actually really funny.,S03E15,303
"Um, this is not a bonding exercise.",S03E15,304
No.,S03E15,305
We did this in my acting class to break down our emotions.,S03E15,306
I feel so worthless!,S03E15,307
"Well, as you can see, it's very effective.",S03E15,308
"You know what, Vonnie? You're even meaner than Coach Hammerstone!",S03E15,309
"Oh, please.",S03E15,310
Nobody's meaner than that diphthong.,S03E15,311
"- Yeah, the worst.",S03E15,312
- I hate him.,S03E15,313
- We don't like the coach?  - Hate him.,S03E15,314
And I like everybody.,S03E15,315
"Well Well, that's it.",S03E15,316
The best thing any team can bond over,S03E15,317
A common enemy.,S03E15,318
Grab your coats.,S03E15,319
Wait. What about the slumber party?,S03E15,320
"Oh, don't worry.",S03E15,321
"After we humiliate the coach, we'll all come back here and get in our jammies.",S03E15,322
If there's one thing I've learned from all my years of doctoring,S03E15,323
It's that sticks and stones can break your bones.,S03E15,324
- Good to know.,S03E15,325
- Mm-hmm.,S03E15,326
"You know who used to live in your apartment, Molly?",S03E15,327
A clown.,S03E15,328
"Oh, right.",S03E15,329
Patches.,S03E15,330
I'm subletting from him.,S03E15,331
He's working on a cruise ship.,S03E15,332
Boats and clowns.,S03E15,333
"Ugh, two of my biggest fears.",S03E15,334
Actually my biggest fear,S03E15,335
Would be a boat full of spiders,S03E15,336
Driven by a clown.,S03E15,337
Okay.,S03E15,338
"So, shall we retire to the",S03E15,339
Over there?,S03E15,340
"Hey, can I ask you something?",S03E15,341
Sure.,S03E15,342
I fell off my bike and scraped my elbow.,S03E15,343
I think it might be infected.,S03E15,344
"- Would you take a look?  - Oh, um.",S03E15,345
"I'm ear, nose, and throat.",S03E15,346
"You need more of a wrist, elbow, armpit guy.",S03E15,347
"Still. You are a doctor, right?",S03E15,348
Got me there.,S03E15,349
Okay.,S03E15,350
Let's take a look.,S03E15,351
Ewe ewe ewe ewe ewe ewe ewe!,S03E15,352
That's disgusting.,S03E15,353
- Is it infected?  - It's something. Cover it up!,S03E15,354
Oh! Ohh.,S03E15,355
"Oh, I would rather be on the spider clown boat right now.",S03E15,356
PJ\NPJ?,S03E15,357
"You're not really a doctor, are you?",S03E15,358
No.,S03E15,359
I'm not. I,S03E15,360
Spray cologne at Bimbel's Department store.,S03E15,361
Why did you lie?,S03E15,362
Because you seemed so impressed by all the doctor stuff.,S03E15,363
I didn't think you'd like me if you knew what I really do.,S03E15,364
I'm sorry.,S03E15,365
Well,S03E15,366
Actually,S03E15,367
I wasn't completely honest with you either.,S03E15,368
What do you mean?,S03E15,369
I'm not really a student.,S03E15,370
What are you?,S03E15,371
This is a surprise.,S03E15,372
"I don't usually tell people on the first date,",S03E15,373
but it kind of came up naturally.,S03E15,374
Okay okay okay.,S03E15,375
I just need some time to get used to this.,S03E15,376
"PJ, a lot of people are afraid of clowns, but I can help you get over that.",S03E15,377
Okay okay okay. Um,S03E15,378
We'll start tomorrow.,S03E15,379
"Take that, Hammerstone!",S03E15,380
- Whoa.,S03E15,381
- Yes.,S03E15,382
"Yeah, taste my two-ply fury!",S03E15,383
"- Great shot, Vonnie. You rock!  - Yeah!",S03E15,384
"Keep firing, girls.",S03E15,385
Five bucks if anyone can get it down the chimney.,S03E15,386
Look at this.,S03E15,387
We're really coming together as a team.,S03E15,388
Your idea actually worked.,S03E15,389
"Well, of course it worked. Why are you surprised?",S03E15,390
"I don't know, maybe I've been influenced by the last,",S03E15,391
50 ideas that went so horribly wrong.,S03E15,392
"Well, maybe in the future you'll give your old mom some credit.",S03E15,393
She knows what she's doing.,S03E15,394
Mrs. Duncan?,S03E15,395
Why does Coach Hammerstone's welcome mat say The Johnsons?,S03E15,396
Huh?,S03E15,397
"Is is 306 North Birchwood, right?",S03E15,398
This is 306 South Birchwood.,S03E15,399
Bummer.,S03E15,400
Run!,S03E15,401
Aah!,S03E15,402
"Whoever doesn't get arrested, meet me at 306 North Birchwood!",S03E15,403
Wait wait wait.,S03E15,404
Don't answer that.,S03E15,405
"Gabe, it's Emma.",S03E15,406
Are you home?,S03E15,407
It's a trick.,S03E15,408
I know he's out there.,S03E15,409
I'm not here.,S03E15,410
Emma.,S03E15,411
And the Rand-man.,S03E15,412
I didn't want to say anything so I could trick your dad.,S03E15,413
"So, where is the Ka-Bobster?",S03E15,414
Um,S03E15,415
He's not home.,S03E15,416
"Yes, he is.",S03E15,417
"Uh, no.",S03E15,418
No he's not.,S03E15,419
She falls apart every time he leaves so we try to keep her out of the loop.,S03E15,420
He's in there.,S03E15,421
"Oh, I love this guy.",S03E15,422
Always playing games.,S03E15,423
- Gotcha!  - Hey.,S03E15,424
"So, want to sit down?",S03E15,425
Sure.,S03E15,426
Isn't it great that our dads are best friends?,S03E15,427
"Yeah, about that.",S03E15,428
Um,S03E15,429
The truth is,S03E15,430
My dad isn't crazy about your dad.,S03E15,431
What? What's wrong with my dad?,S03E15,432
"For one thing, he's kind of loud.",S03E15,433
He's outgoing.,S03E15,434
He makes up a bunch of stupid nicknames.,S03E15,435
Ka-Bobster? That's hilarious.,S03E15,436
"I mean, he licks his fingers and eats other people's food.",S03E15,437
Yeah.,S03E15,438
I've got nothing for that one.,S03E15,439
"You know, your dad's not exactly perfect.",S03E15,440
"He's grumpy, and messy, and says stupid things",S03E15,441
Whoa whoa whoa.,S03E15,442
My dad's not the problem.,S03E15,443
Yours is.,S03E15,444
"I mean, yeah.",S03E15,445
"My dad is a problem, but not this problem.",S03E15,446
"Well, I can't believe you're saying bad things about my dad.",S03E15,447
Daddy? Let's go!,S03E15,448
"- What's wrong, honey?  - I want to go.",S03E15,449
Gabe's a jerk.,S03E15,450
Oh Oh yeah? Well,S03E15,451
You don't smell like flowers any more!,S03E15,452
Good one.,S03E15,453
Wasn't it?,S03E15,454
Wow.,S03E15,455
This is a shock.,S03E15,456
"Hey, I guess this is it for us, too, huh?",S03E15,457
Just because the kids aren't seeing each other doesn't mean that we can't.,S03E15,458
"Hey, I got a great idea.",S03E15,459
Let's go camping.,S03E15,460
"Hey, I got a better idea.",S03E15,461
What is it?,S03E15,462
"Well, Charlie.",S03E15,463
"Um, once again mom interfered with one of my activities,",S03E15,464
but this time she actually helped.,S03E15,465
"Yeah, thanks to her, the team really bonded.",S03E15,466
"And, uh, we'll have a chance to bond even more",S03E15,467
at our court-ordered community service.,S03E15,468
Hello?,S03E15,469
Who?,S03E15,470
Bob-a-lama-ding-dong?,S03E15,471
"- I'm not here.  - Oh, yes you are!",S03E15,472
"Well, it looks like Bob-a-lama-ding-dong has a new friend.",S03E15,473
Ooh.,S03E15,474
"Wish him good luck, Charlie.",S03E15,475
"Teddy, honey, it's not true.",S03E15,476
Those girls were just being mean.,S03E15,477
Are you sure?,S03E15,478
"Yes, I'm sure.",S03E15,479
You do not have a big head.,S03E15,480
You're not just saying that?,S03E15,481
No.,S03E15,482
No.,S03E15,483
Lots of families have to have their doors widened.,S03E15,484
It's just that lately I've been feeling Like it's,S03E15,485
Bigger than usual.,S03E15,486
"Well, that's because You've been spending too much time with your brothers.",S03E15,487
"Hey, guys. What's going on?",S03E15,488
What you looking at?,S03E15,489

Squishy squishy squishy.,S03E16,4

J.,S03E16,20
? - Yup.,S03E16,21
Do you think you could cook an actual French dinner?,S03E16,22
"Well, I think so. Why?",S03E16,23
"Well, because my one-year anniversary with Spencer is coming up,",S03E16,24
and I want to surprise him with a romantic dinner.,S03E16,25
And it has to be French because we met in French class.,S03E16,26
"Oh, it was a rainy Monday.",S03E16,27
"Freshman year, third period.",S03E16,28
We were both in Mademoisel Fisher's class,S03E16,29
Teddy?,S03E16,30
You're painting a wonderful tapestry of words to conjure up a place in time,S03E16,31
And that is why I'm leaving.,S03E16,32
Cool again.,S03E16,33
"So, uh, what do you think?",S03E16,34
"Sure, I'll make you guys dinner.",S03E16,35
Sounds fun.,S03E16,36
Can we do it at your place on Halloween night?,S03E16,37
That way Spencer won't suspect a thing and I can make him dress up.,S03E16,38
See? Teddy's getting Spencer to dress up.,S03E16,39
You can't compare me to a 17-year-old.,S03E16,40
"Well, that's for sure.",S03E16,41
Today's all burnt toast ,S03E16,42
"Running late, and dad jokes",S03E16,43
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S03E16,44
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S03E16,45
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S03E16,46
There it is up on the roof,S03E16,47
"I've been there, I've survived",S03E16,48
So just take my advice,S03E16,49
"Hang in there, baby",S03E16,50
Things are crazy,S03E16,51
But I know your future's bright,S03E16,52
"Hang in there, baby",S03E16,53
There's no maybe,S03E16,54

"Using that old chestnut again, huh?",S03E16,63
"Hey, if it ain't broke.",S03E16,64
Now what do you want?,S03E16,65
I actually want to discuss Halloween.,S03E16,66
I was thinking this year we might skip the annual pranks.,S03E16,67
I'm getting too old for pranks anyway.,S03E16,68
Although I did already buy the eggs and shaving cream.,S03E16,69
I could take those off you.,S03E16,70
I can use the eggs for breakfast and the shaving cream for,S03E16,71
"Ah, bup bup bup bup bup!",S03E16,72
My legs.,S03E16,73
I'm sorry.,S03E16,74
Do you not know what bup bup bup bup means?,S03E16,75
"Listen, while I'm here, I need to ask you something else.",S03E16,76
Can you ride with me to my ladies' club meeting,S03E16,77
Wednesday night so I can use the carpool lane?,S03E16,78
- I'll pay you.  - How much?,S03E16,79

A family of kangaroos.,S03E16,88
That's cute.,S03E16,89
Cute?,S03E16,90
"It took us two hours to get into these costumes, and all we get is cute?",S03E16,91
"No worries, mate.",S03E16,92
Throw another shrimp on the barbie.,S03E16,93
"Shut up, Bob.",S03E16,94
"Go ahead, Charlie.",S03E16,95
Tell him what we practiced.,S03E16,96
I wanna be a Princess.,S03E16,97
Everybody wants to be a Princess.,S03E16,98
That's why you're a kangaroo.,S03E16,99
What she was supposed to say was hoppy Halloween!,S03E16,100
Where's your costume?,S03E16,101
- Uh I'm wearing it.,S03E16,102
- Those are your work clothes.,S03E16,103
"Yeah! No, I'm a",S03E16,104
I'm going as an exterminator this year.,S03E16,105
An exterminator?,S03E16,106
"Okay, I am sweating my marsupial butt off",S03E16,107
in here and that's the best you came up with?,S03E16,108
All right.,S03E16,109
"Well, hang on.",S03E16,110
I'm not done.,S03E16,111
I'm not done.,S03E16,112
You know what?.,S03E16,113
Huh?,S03E16,114

Who's your sidekick? Pesticide Pete?,S03E16,118
"Mommy, this candy's yucky.",S03E16,119

Uncle Milt's Honey Globs.,S03E16,121
Why did you buy this disgusting candy?,S03E16,122
It's not disgusting.,S03E16,123
It was on sale.,S03E16,124
Ingredients: Honey,S03E16,125
Glob.,S03E16,126
"Bob, go get some better candy.",S03E16,127
UhBob's not here right now.,S03E16,128
I'm Captain Extermo.,S03E16,129
"Okay. Well, when you see Bob could you tell him I'd like to speak with him?",S03E16,130
Uh Who would like to speak to him?,S03E16,131
Kangar-Amy or Amy?,S03E16,132
Amy.,S03E16,133
"Ooh, he may be gone for a while.",S03E16,134
Happy anniversary!,S03E16,135
Surprise!,S03E16,136
I took you to Paris.,S03E16,137
Bonjour.,S03E16,138
Welcome to Chez PeJhay.,S03E16,139

Chez P.,S03E16,142
J.,S03E16,143
Oh!,S03E16,144
Stupid tourists.,S03E16,145
So I decorated the place and P.,S03E16,146
J.,S03E16,147
Is going to cook us an authentic French meal.,S03E16,148
"Although, we didn't discuss the accent.",S03E16,149
"To cook French, you must be French.",S03E16,150
Your table.,S03E16,151
Tadah!,S03E16,152
"Um, I think tadah is more magician than French.",S03E16,153
Your table.,S03E16,154
Voila!,S03E16,155
Your menus for the evening.,S03E16,156
There's only one thing on it.,S03E16,157
An excellent choice.,S03E16,158
"And now, the music.",S03E16,159
Hey!,S03E16,160
Emmett's here.,S03E16,161
Another thing we didn't discuss.,S03E16,162
"When you play the accordion, you never turn down a gig.",S03E16,163
Huh.,S03E16,164
A room full of old ladies on Halloween night.,S03E16,165
And suddenly I'm not cool again.,S03E16,166
So how long is this gonna take?,S03E16,167
Just until I get my award.,S03E16,168
You're getting an award?,S03E16,169
"Yes, for being the volunteer of the year.",S03E16,170
It's for my work with troubled kids.,S03E16,171
But you hate kids.,S03E16,172
But I do like awards.,S03E16,173
And I may have mentioned that I would bring,S03E16,174
one of the troubled kids with me tonight.,S03E16,175
Wait a minute.,S03E16,176
"Something doesn't smell right here, and it's not just the old ladies.",S03E16,177
You brought me here just so you could get a stupid award!,S03E16,178
Happy Halloween!,S03E16,179
You've been tricked and it's my treat.,S03E16,180
You take this one.,S03E16,181
Trick or treat!,S03E16,182
Hey! All right.,S03E16,183
There you go.,S03E16,184
"Hey, that is one cool costume.",S03E16,185
I'm thinking wolf spider?,S03E16,186
Yeah.,S03E16,187
I'm really into bugs.,S03E16,188
Yeah? Me too.,S03E16,189
Check it out.,S03E16,190
I'm Captain Extermo.,S03E16,191
A superhero exterminator?!,S03E16,192
Awesome!,S03E16,193
Can I get a picture with you?,S03E16,194
Yeah! Sure.,S03E16,195
"Honey, you wanna come over here?",S03E16,196
Somebody wants a picture with Captain Extermo.,S03E16,197
What?,S03E16,198
What are you supposed to be? A dog that ate another dog?,S03E16,199
I'm a kangaroo.,S03E16,200
And this is my joey.,S03E16,201
Just take the picture.,S03E16,202
May I present the first course?,S03E16,203
Sweetbreads.,S03E16,204
Tadah!,S03E16,205
I looked it up.,S03E16,206
Tadah is acceptable.,S03E16,207
Mm.,S03E16,208
Bread and sweets.,S03E16,209
Two of my favorite things.,S03E16,210
Neither one of which is in my mouth right now.,S03E16,211
- Garcon? - Oui?,S03E16,212
What exactly are in these sweetbreads?,S03E16,213
"Ah! Uh, you have pancreas.",S03E16,214
nd the gentleman has stomach lining.,S03E16,215
Bon Appetit.,S03E16,216
Emmett.,S03E16,217
"- Do you want any sweetbreads? - No, but I know who might.",S03E16,218
It's like they haven't had pancreas in weeks.,S03E16,219
"You know what, Teddy?",S03E16,220
This is really nice.,S03E16,221
"Well, it was as close as I could get to a trip to Paris.",S03E16,222
"Plus, I thought it would be perfect considering where we first met.",S03E16,223
"Oh, yeah.",S03E16,224
Of course.,S03E16,225
"Yeah, I'll never forget it.",S03E16,226
We were in French class and I dropped my pen and then you said,S03E16,227
"Hey, a pen.",S03E16,228
No no.,S03E16,229
"You picked it up, you handed it me, and you said",S03E16,230
"Votre plume, mademoiselle.",S03E16,231
"Oh, yeah.",S03E16,232
Of course.,S03E16,233
"You don't remember any of this, do you?",S03E16,234
"Honestly, no.",S03E16,235
But does it really matter where we met?,S03E16,236
"Um, does it matter?",S03E16,237
It's only the beginning of our relationship.,S03E16,238
"Spence, we talked about how we both wanted to go to Paris someday.",S03E16,239
I can't believe I went through all this trouble,S03E16,240
and you don't even remember!,S03E16,241
"- Wait, where are you going? - As far away from you as I can get!",S03E16,242
I understand there's a problem with the sweetbreads.,S03E16,243
"And now, for her tireless work with troubled kids,",S03E16,244
it is my sincere pleasure to present our volunteer of the year award,S03E16,245
to Estelle Dabney.,S03E16,246
Thank you.,S03E16,247
"And along with a plaque, comes a check for $500.",S03E16,248
Oh.,S03E16,249
I had almost forgot about that part.,S03E16,250
I assume you'll be putting that money,S03E16,251
towards your work with troubled children.,S03E16,252
What else would I do with it?,S03E16,253
Buy a gold lame tracksuit?,S03E16,254
"It's not enough I got tricked, I gotta see that?",S03E16,255
Now,S03E16,256
I was hoping we could hear from the young man you brought with,S03E16,257
you tonight.Maybe he could say a few words?,S03E16,258
Oh.,S03E16,259
That's not a good idea.,S03E16,260
He's very troubled.,S03E16,261
"Oh, I'd be happy to say a few words.",S03E16,262
The type of words I say will depend on my cut of the 500.,S03E16,263
That's blackmail.,S03E16,264
That's right.,S03E16,265
"Thank you, old ladies.",S03E16,266
"My name is Gabe and,",S03E16,267
I'm here to tell you the real story about Mrs.,S03E16,268
Dabney.,S03E16,269
Fifty-fifty.,S03E16,270
This woman,S03E16,271
Is my angel.,S03E16,272
Teddy,S03E16,273
I'm sorry I forgot how we met.,S03E16,274
It's about more than forgetting a few details.,S03E16,275
Sometimes I just feel like,S03E16,276
I'm more into this relationship than you are.,S03E16,277
Remember that period when we were broken up?,S03E16,278
Yeah.,S03E16,279
How long was that?,S03E16,280
I don't know. Like nine months?,S03E16,281
"Eight months, 19 days and four hours.",S03E16,282
Wow.,S03E16,283
"Teddy, you're the best thing that's ever happened to me.",S03E16,284
"I may not remember the moment we met,",S03E16,285
but can still make this a moment to remember.,S03E16,286
How are we gonna do that?,S03E16,287
"Well, I have an idea.",S03E16,288
"Uh, do you guys mind? We're just trying to have a moment here.",S03E16,289
"Yeah, and your moment is ruining my Halloween party.",S03E16,290
Okay. Um Why are you guys all dressed up in clown suits?,S03E16,291
Because we're clowns.,S03E16,292
"So technically, you're not dressed up for Halloween,",S03E16,293
you're just wearing your work clothes.,S03E16,294
That's kinda what I've been saying.,S03E16,295
Whose side are you on?!,S03E16,296
And whatever you're cooking over there It's hurting my nose.,S03E16,297
"Yeah? Well, your face is hurting my eyes, Bozo.",S03E16,298
I have a name.,S03E16,299
Okay. What is your name?,S03E16,300
Boom-boom.,S03E16,301
And I'm Tinkles.,S03E16,302
"Boom-boom and Tinkles,",S03E16,303
You sound like two things my baby brother makes in his diaper.,S03E16,304
Hey! Nobody makes fun of my name!,S03E16,305
Sure we do. We got that whole bit where we walk down the street,S03E16,306
Shut up!,S03E16,307
"This isn't over yet, missy.",S03E16,308
You messed with the wrong clowns.,S03E16,309
Oh.,S03E16,310
"You know, it's a little hard to be scared of somebody",S03E16,311
with green hair and a permanent smile!,S03E16,312
"- Okay, that's enough.",S03E16,313
"- Just saying, geez.",S03E16,314
"Tinkles, Binky, Bo-Bo, time to put on the big shoes.",S03E16,315
We got some work to do.,S03E16,316
I know sometimes Mrs.,S03E16,317
Dabney looks mean.,S03E16,318
But underneath that scowl,S03E16,319
There's a frown,S03E16,320
And underneath that frown,S03E16,321
There's a grimace.,S03E16,322
And if you keep chipping and chipping and chipping,S03E16,323
Underneath that,S03E16,324
You'll find a snarl.,S03E16,325
Move it along.,S03E16,326
"And then, with just a little more chipping",S03E16,327
Underneath that,S03E16,328
You'll find a smile.,S03E16,329
A smile,S03E16,330
That has warmed my heart.,S03E16,331
And changed my life forever.,S03E16,332
"Thank you, Gabe.",S03E16,333
That was very moving.,S03E16,334
Now let's take a break for dessert.,S03E16,335
Well.,S03E16,336
Here's something I've never said before,S03E16,337
You did good.,S03E16,338
Thank you.,S03E16,339
"And I have to say, I admire you for scamming these helpless old ladies.",S03E16,340
"It was good, wasn't it?",S03E16,341
"You know, we make a pretty good team.",S03E16,342
"We do, don't we?",S03E16,343
We should team up again.,S03E16,344
Got any other scams?,S03E16,345
I might have a few.,S03E16,346
Mrs.,S03E16,347
"Dabney, this may be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.",S03E16,348
"Here's looking at you, kid.",S03E16,349
Trick or treat.,S03E16,350
Aw.,S03E16,351
Aren't you adorable? You're a bee.,S03E16,352
A bee who's got to be home by nine.,S03E16,353
Let's see some candy.,S03E16,354
"Wow, this bee's got a stinger.",S03E16,355
Uncle Milt's Honey Globs?,S03E16,356
"Well, bees like honey, right?",S03E16,357
"It's a costume, lady.",S03E16,358
"Okay, see you next year!",S03E16,359
Doubt it.,S03E16,360
What the!,S03E16,361
"- Hi, Mommy.",S03E16,362
- There's a bat in the house.,S03E16,363
- A bat?!  - It just flew in.,S03E16,364
"Get it out, get it out, get it out!",S03E16,365
"Oh, wait a minute.",S03E16,366
Wait a minute.,S03E16,367
This might be a job for Captain Extermo.,S03E16,368
You better ask him.,S03E16,369
Fine.,S03E16,370
"Please help me, Captain Extermo.",S03E16,371
Now say my catchphrase.,S03E16,372
"Captain Extermo, sleeping on the couch every night for the rest of his life.",S03E16,373
Close enough!,S03E16,374
And for your cheese course tonight,S03E16,375
Fromage American.,S03E16,376
I think we'll skip the cheese course.,S03E16,377
Excellent choice.,S03E16,378
The cheese course is traditionally when you tip the accordion player.,S03E16,379
- Go away.,S03E16,380
"- Very good, Madame.",S03E16,381
This is the last time I let you talk me into,S03E16,382
playing the accordion for one of your fancy French dinners.,S03E16,383
It's probably the last time it'll come up.,S03E16,384
"Now, um, I believe someone owes me a moment.",S03E16,385
I believe I do.,S03E16,386
I'll get it.,S03E16,387
Oh.,S03E16,388
"Hey, look.",S03E16,389
The entertainment's here.,S03E16,390
I didn't order any entertainment.,S03E16,391
"Well, someone did because there's a whole mess of clowns out there.",S03E16,392
Clowns?!,S03E16,393
"No, don't open the door!",S03E16,394
"Mrs. Dabney,",S03E16,395
I never imagined our criminal partnership would be so successful.,S03E16,396
It's like we belong together.,S03E16,397
And we're gonna stay together.,S03E16,398
For a long long time.,S03E16,399
- What are you doing here? - I just had the worst dream of my life.,S03E16,400
- Were we dancing? - Yes.,S03E16,401
- In handcuffs?  - Yes!,S03E16,402
What was that about?!,S03E16,403
It's called a guilty conscience!,S03E16,404
We have to give that money back.,S03E16,405
"Oh, you think?!",S03E16,406
So I guess the partnership is over.,S03E16,407
"Well, it was fun while it lasted.",S03E16,408
Mm.,S03E16,409
- Hug?   - Give Mama some sugar.,S03E16,410
Aw.,S03E16,411
Mrs.,S03E16,412
"Dabney, we have to give back the money we stole.",S03E16,413
"What do you mean, who is this?",S03E16,414
"Hey, Charlie. So, uh",S03E16,415
Crazy Halloween for the Duncans.,S03E16,416
There was a bat in the house.,S03E16,417
"Then for a short period of time, Gabe and Mrs.",S03E16,418
Dabney were friends.,S03E16,419
And then Spencer and I celebrated our one-year anniversary,S03E16,420
with a romantic dinner and,S03E16,421
A clown attack.,S03E16,422
But it wasn't actually that bad.,S03E16,423
For me.,S03E16,424
"Then again, I'm not afraid of clowns.",S03E16,425
Clowns in my house.,S03E16,426
Clowns in my house.,S03E16,427
Clowns in my house.,S03E16,428
"Well, at least he's talking.",S03E16,429
Clowns in my house!,S03E16,430
"Wish him good luck, Charlie.",S03E16,431
"We've had a lot of fun here tonight, at the expense of clowns.",S03E16,432
But we're here to let you know that,S03E16,433
clowning is a very serious profession.,S03E16,434
One that takes years of training.,S03E16,435
"And contrary to what you saw tonight, we are not a violent people.",S03E16,436
Ah!,S03E16,437
We just wanna be treated with the,S03E16,438
same love and respect as everyone else.,S03E16,439
"Stay in school, kids.",S03E16,440
What is this?,S03E17,0
- Ooh ooh! I know!  - Wait.,S03E17,1
- I want Gabe to answer.,S03E17,2
- Aw.,S03E17,3
Uh It's a plate.,S03E17,4
Wrong.,S03E17,5
Whoa.,S03E17,6
That'll teach me to get cocky.,S03E17,7
"It's a dirty plate, which you were supposed to put in the dishwasher.",S03E17,8
Now come on! How easy is that?,S03E17,9
"If it's so easy, why didn't you do it?",S03E17,10
Now the plate's all the way out here and that one's on you.,S03E17,11
"You know what, Mister?",S03E17,12
You just bought yourself a ticket to a weekend of yard work.,S03E17,13
Take care of the plate.,S03E17,14
He's really been on my case lately.,S03E17,15
I don't know what to do about it.,S03E17,16
Well,S03E17,17
You could put that plate in the dishwasher.,S03E17,18
"Yeah, but then he wins.",S03E17,19
"Brother man, you should do what I did.",S03E17,20
Get your own apartment.,S03E17,21
"Dude, I'm 13.",S03E17,22
"Well, then we're back to the plate.",S03E17,23
Oh hey!,S03E17,24
I got an idea. How about I come stay at your place this weekend?,S03E17,25
"Oh, yeah, sure.",S03E17,26
Why not? Emmett's out of town.,S03E17,27
Should be fun.,S03E17,28
"- Hey, can I bring Jake? - Sure.",S03E17,29
"All right, this is great.",S03E17,30
"Since I'm not here, I don't have to do yard work.",S03E17,31
And then guess who wins?,S03E17,32
- I do.,S03E17,33
"- Yeah yeah No, I know.",S03E17,34
I was just.,S03E17,35
Got nervous after the whole plate thing.,S03E17,36
Today's all burnt toast ,S03E17,37
"Running late, and dad jokes",S03E17,38
Has anybody seen my left shoe?,S03E17,39
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S03E17,40
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S03E17,41
There it is up on the roof.,S03E17,42
"I've been there, I've survived",S03E17,43
So just take my advice.,S03E17,44
"Hang in there, baby",S03E17,45
Things are crazy,S03E17,46
But I know your future's bright.,S03E17,47
"Hang in there, baby",S03E17,48
There's no maybe,S03E17,49
Everything turns out all right.,S03E17,50
Sure life is up and down.,S03E17,51
"But trust me, it comes back around.",S03E17,52
You're gonna love who  you turn out to be.,S03E17,53
"Hang in there, baby.",S03E17,54
"Spencer, how are you not understanding this?",S03E17,55
I just I just don't see what the big deal is.,S03E17,56
Okay okay.,S03E17,57
Let me break this down one more time.,S03E17,58
"So, I had just done my big performance in drama class.",S03E17,59
"And then, that horrible Ashley walks up to me and she says",S03E17,60
Looks like you're really having fun out there.,S03E17,61
I still don't see why that's so bad.,S03E17,62
She was totally insulting me!,S03E17,63
But By saying you had fun?,S03E17,64
"Yes, that's what you say when somebody's performance stinks.",S03E17,65
Everybody knows that.,S03E17,66
"Teddy, it just seems like you're making a big deal out of nothing.",S03E17,67
Oh yeah? Yeah?,S03E17,68
"Well, it seems like you're making nothing out of a big deal!",S03E17,69
"Yeah, that's what I meant to say.",S03E17,70
Okay.,S03E17,71
Who put all of Toby's stuffed animals on the porch?,S03E17,72
Gabe.,S03E17,73
Aw.,S03E17,74
She pinned her first crime on me.,S03E17,75
- What am I gonna do about this?  - About what?,S03E17,76
Charlie.,S03E17,77
She still doesn't like Toby.,S03E17,78
This has been going on for months.,S03E17,79
I thought she'd be over it by now.,S03E17,80
"Mom, some things take time.",S03E17,81
"I mean, I still don't like Charlie.",S03E17,82
Teddy doesn't like me.,S03E17,83
PJ doesn't like Teddy.,S03E17,84
It's what makes us a family.,S03E17,85
"Gabe, I wanted this time to be different.",S03E17,86
"After all, Toby is gonna be my last baby.",S03E17,87
Mm-hmm.,S03E17,88
Come on in.,S03E17,89
- Hey.,S03E17,90
- Hey.,S03E17,91
"So. This is where you live, huh?",S03E17,92
Yep.,S03E17,93
"Well, it's still beats doing yard work.",S03E17,94
"Hey, Gabe's brother.",S03E17,95
- What's up? - Hey.,S03E17,96
"- What happened to Jake? - He was busy, so",S03E17,97
"I called a couple of other kids and, uh",S03E17,98
"They weren't able to make it either, so",S03E17,99
Here's Logan.,S03E17,100
I'm often the last choice.,S03E17,101
"Charlie, I bought you a present.",S03E17,102
Mm! Isn't it cute?,S03E17,103
Ohh.,S03E17,104
Here you go.,S03E17,105
"Now, the first thing we need to do is name him.",S03E17,106
"Right, now what's a really good name for a sweet little baby boy?",S03E17,107
"Oh, well, there's Joby",S03E17,108
"Or Kobe, or",S03E17,109
- Toby. - Toby!,S03E17,110
That's a great idea.,S03E17,111
So now when mommy's taking care of her baby you can take care of your baby.,S03E17,112
I'm going to pick up my Toby and give him a hug.,S03E17,113
"Hello, little man.",S03E17,114
Hello.,S03E17,115
"Ooh, big hug.",S03E17,116
Yeah.,S03E17,117
And you're gonna give your Toby a big hug.,S03E17,118
Oh.,S03E17,119
Mommy shoots  She scores.,S03E17,120
"Hey, Spence. Flowers, huh?",S03E17,121
Yeah.,S03E17,122
I really owe Teddy an apology.,S03E17,123
For what?,S03E17,124
I have no idea.,S03E17,125
"Luckily for you, I do.",S03E17,126
You know what? Step into my office.,S03E17,127
Okay.,S03E17,128
Look.,S03E17,129
The reason she got mad at you is that,S03E17,130
you didn't get upset about nothing.,S03E17,131
"Yeah, but it was nothing, right?",S03E17,132
"Well, of course it was nothing.",S03E17,133
"- Well, I mean you know that.",S03E17,134
- Yeah.,S03E17,135
I know that.,S03E17,136
We're talking about the female of the species.,S03E17,137
Okay? A highly irrational creature.,S03E17,138
"Fortunately for you, after 20 long years of marriage, I am kind of an expert.",S03E17,139
Okay.,S03E17,140
Look.,S03E17,141
The key.,S03E17,142
Is that you gotta let Teddy think that you care about,S03E17,143
All this stuff that's not worth caring about.,S03E17,144
"Look, when they have an issue, like, like",S03E17,145
- Like Teddy did yesterday - Mm.,S03E17,146
You just don't react.,S03E17,147
You overreact.,S03E17,148
- So how do I do that? - I'll show you.,S03E17,149
Okay.,S03E17,150
"- You know what, you be Teddy.",S03E17,151
- Okay.,S03E17,152
- I'll be you.,S03E17,153
All right.,S03E17,154
- Yeah.,S03E17,155
- Get mad about something.,S03E17,156
- Okay.,S03E17,157
Um.,S03E17,158
A girl at school didn't like my hair.,S03E17,159
What?!,S03E17,160
How could someone not like your hair?!,S03E17,161
- You have the best hair ever.,S03E17,162
"- Well, hey, calm down.",S03E17,163
"No, I can't! You know what? It just It just",S03E17,164
It just burns me because your hair is so awesome.,S03E17,165
- How do you feel? - Like you really care about my hair.,S03E17,166
And,S03E17,167
I couldn't care less.,S03E17,168
"Oh, Mr.",S03E17,169
Duncan.,S03E17,170
This is really good stuff.,S03E17,171
"Isn't it? Hey, you know the beauty of this is, it works every time.",S03E17,172
Except the next time.,S03E17,173
"Okay, here comes a skateboarder.",S03E17,174
"All right, wait for it.",S03E17,175
Wait for it.,S03E17,176
Now.,S03E17,177
Oh yes!,S03E17,178
Oh.,S03E17,179
Looking up.,S03E17,180
Looking up!.,S03E17,181
Pizza's here.,S03E17,182
"- Hey, what are you guys doing?  - Dropping water balloons.",S03E17,183
"Come on, it's your turn.",S03E17,184
Quick.,S03E17,185
There's two old ladies coming.,S03E17,186
Come on.,S03E17,187
You guys cannot be dropping water balloons.,S03E17,188
"- Well, why not?  - Because I live here.",S03E17,189
And I want to keep living here. And what is with the tent?,S03E17,190
It's a sleepover.,S03E17,191
You can't have a sleepover without a tent.,S03E17,192
"All right, well.",S03E17,193
We'll take this.,S03E17,194
"Hey, guys.",S03E17,195
That pizza's for all of us.,S03E17,196
"Hey, let's make some prank phone calls.",S03E17,197
"Oh, come on.",S03E17,198
Prank phone calls? You guys are 13 years old.,S03E17,199
"Are you really Oh, hang on.",S03E17,200
Hello?,S03E17,201
No my butt is not on fire. Who is this?,S03E17,202
"Boys, quiet.",S03E17,203
I'm on the phone.,S03E17,204
"Teddy, Spencer's here.",S03E17,205
"Oh, thanks.",S03E17,206
"Oh, no no.",S03E17,207
You didn't let me finish.,S03E17,208
Spencer's here talking with your father.,S03E17,209
About what?,S03E17,210
That's the interesting part.,S03E17,211
Yeah.,S03E17,212
I just overheard Dr.,S03E17,213
Bob.,S03E17,214
Professor of Womanology,S03E17,215
Explain to Spencer that the best way of handling us gals,S03E17,216
is to pretend to care about stuff that isn't worth caring about.,S03E17,217
"Really? Well, if I know Spencer, he said that that was ridiculous.",S03E17,218
"Well, you don't know Spencer.",S03E17,219
I believe his exact words were,S03E17,220
"This is really good stuff, Mr.",S03E17,221
Duncan.,S03E17,222
Huh.,S03E17,223
"Well, I think I need to have a little chat with my fella.",S03E17,224
No no no no.,S03E17,225
We do not handle these things with communication.,S03E17,226
"Come on, Teddy.",S03E17,227
We get revenge.,S03E17,228
First on Spencer,S03E17,229
Then on Dr.,S03E17,230
Bob.,S03E17,231
"Oh, I see Dr.",S03E17,232
Amy's in the house.,S03E17,233
Mm-hmm.,S03E17,234
And she's about to administer 10 CC's of ba-bam.,S03E17,235
Oh!,S03E17,236
"Hey, guys? Volume.",S03E17,237
"Oh, he's right.",S03E17,238
Let's crank it up.,S03E17,239
No.,S03E17,240
Turn it down.,S03E17,241
- What? - Down.,S03E17,242
I can't hear myself think.,S03E17,243
No one's ever heard you think.,S03E17,244
You know what? That is it.,S03E17,245
I have had enough of you two.,S03E17,246
No more video games.,S03E17,247
- What? - No more video games.,S03E17,248
I'm trying to study for a test.,S03E17,249
"- What are we supposed to do?  - I don't care, as long as it's quiet.",S03E17,250
"Man, I thought you said your brother was fun.",S03E17,251
He used to be.,S03E17,252
Before he turned into dad.,S03E17,253
"What did you just say, Mister?",S03E17,254
Now you even sound like him.,S03E17,255
"You know, I came over here to get away from him, not to be with dad junior.",S03E17,256
I am not dad junior.,S03E17,257
And you just bought yourself a ticket to doing the dishes.,S03E17,258
- We used paper plates.,S03E17,259
- And I want them spotless.,S03E17,260
"Mary Lou, I should be a child psychologist.",S03E17,261
Really.,S03E17,262
I gave Charlie a Toby doll and she loves it.,S03E17,263
And pretty soon she'll feel the same way about the real Toby.,S03E17,264
"I'm telling you, it's brilliant.",S03E17,265
One day it will simply be known as the Duncan method.,S03E17,266
Let me call you back.,S03E17,267
Charlie?,S03E17,268
Did you mistake the trash can for a magical doll house?,S03E17,269
No.,S03E17,270
I'm not two.,S03E17,271
"Oh, Charlie.",S03E17,272
Why don't you love baby Toby? He loves you so much.,S03E17,273
- How do you know? - Because he told me.,S03E17,274
He can't talk.,S03E17,275
Or can he?,S03E17,276
What are you looking at?,S03E17,277
"Yes No, I understand that I lost the receipt, but I never wore them,",S03E17,278
so why can't I take them back?,S03E17,279
But that's a stupid policy!,S03E17,280
Nev Never mind.,S03E17,281
What was that all about?,S03E17,282
"I bought these running shoes, but they were in the wrong size",S03E17,283
and now the stupid store won't let me return them.,S03E17,284
Oh well. What are you gonna do?,S03E17,285
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.,S03E17,286
I'm gonna get angry!,S03E17,287
How dare they treat you like that?!,S03E17,288
- What?  - I can't believe this.,S03E17,289
Who was the idiot you were dealing with?,S03E17,290
"Uh, I think it was someone named Sam?",S03E17,291
"Oh, Sam must have a brain the size of a walnut.",S03E17,292
"Spencer, honey.",S03E17,293
Just calm down.,S03E17,294
"No, I can't calm down, all right? Because I am so furious with this Sam!",S03E17,295
I am disgusted by Sam.,S03E17,296
I am so glad you feel this way.,S03E17,297
I'm gonna get my keys.,S03E17,298
Wait.,S03E17,299
What are you getting your keys for?,S03E17,300
Because we are going down to that store and you're gonna give Sam,S03E17,301
a piece of my mind!,S03E17,302
What just happened?,S03E17,303
I don't know.,S03E17,304
We're in uncharted territory.,S03E17,305
- What do I do now? - I don't know.,S03E17,306
We're in uncharted territory.,S03E17,307
Psst.,S03E17,308
"Hey, Charlie.",S03E17,309
Who said that?,S03E17,310
"It's me, Toby.",S03E17,311
Come here.,S03E17,312
You can talk?,S03E17,313
Just to you.,S03E17,314
Charlie?,S03E17,315
You're my favorite in the whole family.,S03E17,316
- Really? - Yeah.,S03E17,317
"I love you, Charlie.",S03E17,318
Do you love me too?,S03E17,319
Yes.,S03E17,320
That is so,S03E17,321
Goody.,S03E17,322
"Now remember, this is our very special secret.",S03E17,323
Just for us.,S03E17,324
Don't tell anyone.,S03E17,325
Okay?,S03E17,326
Okay.,S03E17,327
"Hi, Charlie.",S03E17,328
Toby talks.,S03E17,329
"You know, there's no reason to cause a scene.",S03E17,330
I think we made our point just by showing up.,S03E17,331
"Yes, hi.",S03E17,332
We'd like to speak to Sam.,S03E17,333
We have a problem.,S03E17,334
I'm Sam.,S03E17,335
What seems to be the problem?,S03E17,336
No problem.,S03E17,337
But you just said there was a problem.,S03E17,338
"No, uh, no.",S03E17,339
She said it.,S03E17,340
"Come on, Spencer.",S03E17,341
Tell him what you told me.,S03E17,342
Gosh. Who can remember?,S03E17,343
He said you have a brain the size of a walnut.,S03E17,344
Excuse me?,S03E17,345
Uh.,S03E17,346
"To be fair, I've seen some pretty large walnuts.",S03E17,347
And And he said that he was disgusted by you.,S03E17,348
But then I walked it back to just furious.,S03E17,349
Is there anything else you'd like to say to me,S03E17,350
before I take you into the break room?,S03E17,351
Where I will break you.,S03E17,352
"Ah, wait.",S03E17,353
"Uh, look.",S03E17,354
I didn't mean any of the things I said.,S03E17,355
"See, I took some bad advice from her father, and uh, I was really stupid.",S03E17,356
And I am very sorry.,S03E17,357
Please don't break me.,S03E17,358
"- Heard enough, Teddy? - Thanks, Sam.",S03E17,359
I'm good.,S03E17,360
Cool.,S03E17,361
"Hope I didn't scare you too much, little guy.",S03E17,362
What just happened?,S03E17,363
"Oh, what just happened was I, the woman",S03E17,364
"Taught you, the idiot, a lesson.",S03E17,365
- So you heard everything?  - My mom did.,S03E17,366
Oh.,S03E17,367
"Look, I promise I'll never take advice from your father again.",S03E17,368
Everyone gets there eventually.,S03E17,369
"Oh, uh, thanks again, Sam.",S03E17,370
"Hey, how do you guys know each other?",S03E17,371
"Oh, he's in my community theater group.",S03E17,372
Great job.,S03E17,373
"Thanks, Teddy. And you",S03E17,374
Really looked like you were having fun out there.,S03E17,375
"Well, that hurt.",S03E17,376
There she is.,S03E17,377
The woman I love.,S03E17,378
These are for you.,S03E17,379
Hmm. What's the occasion?,S03E17,380
There has to be an occasion?,S03E17,381
Can't a man give the love of his life flowers just because?,S03E17,382
Heard about the shoe store?,S03E17,383
"Yes, I did.",S03E17,384

"Oh, come on, honey.",S03E17,388
Honey.,S03E17,389
Come on.,S03E17,390
I don't really believe any of that stuff that I was telling Spencer.,S03E17,391
And you know what? Since Teddy taught him a lesson,S03E17,392
I don't really need you to teach me a lesson.,S03E17,393
"You're afraid, aren't you, Bob?",S03E17,394
Uh-huh.,S03E17,395

Things?,S03E17,401
"Oh, come on. What kind of things?",S03E17,402
"I wish I could help you, but it's out of my hands.",S03E17,403
When did you turn into dad?,S03E17,404
Into dad? Into dad?,S03E17,405
How come when you hear things in your head they always have an echo?,S03E17,406
An echo? An echo?,S03E17,407
I am not turning into dad.,S03E17,408
I just have a lot of responsibilities.,S03E17,409
"School, a job, a future to worry about.",S03E17,410
Those kids have no idea how hard I work.,S03E17,411
"Oh, man.",S03E17,412
I am turning into dad.,S03E17,413
"Hey, guys.",S03E17,414

What do you think?,S03E17,423
- Now let's get mom.,S03E17,424

"Okay, honey.",S03E17,431
Well done.,S03E17,432
Lesson learned.,S03E17,433
What are you talking about?,S03E17,434
This. Isn't this your revenge?,S03E17,435
Drawing on your face?,S03E17,436
"Does that sound like me, Teddy?",S03E17,437
"It's doesn't, mom.",S03E17,438
Hmm.,S03E17,439
So there's more?,S03E17,440
More?,S03E17,441
It hasn't even started.,S03E17,442
Oh.,S03E17,443
"Teddy, turn the camera on.",S03E17,444
"Hey, Charlie. Well, uh,",S03E17,445
"I wasn't really planning on doing a video diary right now,",S03E17,446
"but mom told me to turn the camera on, so something is up.",S03E17,447
"Ooh, donuts!",S03E17,448
Exploding donuts.,S03E17,449
That's,S03E17,450
Lesson learned.,S03E17,451
"- Okay, are we done now?  - Oh.",S03E17,452
Yes.,S03E17,453
With phase one.,S03E17,454
"Oh, man.",S03E17,455
"Wish me good luck, Charlie.",S03E17,456
"Okay, PJ.",S03E17,457
Now I know you've been resenting your sister for some time now.,S03E17,458
So I bought you something to help you finally get over it.,S03E17,459
Open your eyes.,S03E17,460
- What is it? - It's a Teddy doll.,S03E17,461
Go ahead.,S03E17,462
Pull the string.,S03E17,463
You're the best big brother ever.,S03E17,464
Aw.,S03E17,465
This is so sweet.,S03E17,466
I'm so glad you moved out.,S03E17,467
That wasn't quite as nice.,S03E17,468
I never really liked you.,S03E17,469
I'm made of plastic and I'm still smarter than you.,S03E17,470
This is the worst gift ever.,S03E17,471
Oh.,S03E17,472
Okay that's it you're going back to the store.,S03E17,473
You're beautiful. Are you an actress?,S03E17,474
"Okay, I'm going to give you one more shot.",S03E17,475
Gabe.,S03E18,0
"Gabe, I have something to tell you.",S03E18,1
"Tomorrow when I take you to school, I'm",S03E18,2
going to park the car and come inside.,S03E18,3
"Mom, we've been over this.",S03E18,4
"If you have to use the bathroom, you can just go at the gas station.",S03E18,5
You didn't let me finish.,S03E18,6
No. The reason I'm going inside is,S03E18,7
Please don't freak out.,S03E18,8
I'm gonna be your school nurse.,S03E18,9
What?!,S03E18,10
No!,S03E18,11
You can't,S03E18,12
Why do you hate me?!,S03E18,13
"Well, thank you for not freaking out.",S03E18,14
My mom is working at my school?,S03E18,15
My life is over.,S03E18,16
"It's just for a week, okay?",S03E18,17
I'm just filling in while your regular nurse is on vacation.,S03E18,18
You couldn't have done this at a worse time.,S03E18,19
"Right now at school, I'm considered cool.",S03E18,20
I just,S03E18,21
"Okay, you're serious.",S03E18,22
Go on.,S03E18,23
"Well, there's this really cool kid, Walker,",S03E18,24
and he invited me to eat at his lunch table.,S03E18,25
"Now, they're all eighth graders, and I'm only a seventh grader.",S03E18,26
Do you how big of an honor that is?,S03E18,27
"Oh, Gabe.",S03E18,28
I'm sorry.,S03E18,29
I I had no idea.,S03E18,30
Why didn't you tell me?,S03E18,31
I'll just turn down the money we need for groceries.,S03E18,32
Thank you.,S03E18,33
And then I'll teach you about sarcasm.,S03E18,34
"Well, can't you at least not tell anybody you're my mom?",S03E18,35
"I mean, maybe you can use a different name.",S03E18,36
"Well, I guess I could use my maiden name.",S03E18,37
Blankenhooper.,S03E18,38
"That's good. And if we see each other at school,",S03E18,39
we just keep going.,S03E18,40
"We don't talk, we don't look at each other, we don't interact in any way.",S03E18,41
- So just like breakfast?  - Exactly.,S03E18,42
Today's all burnt toast,S03E18,43
Running late and dad jokes.,S03E18,44
Has anybody seen my left shoe?,S03E18,45
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S03E18,46
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud.",S03E18,47
There it is up on the roof.,S03E18,48
"I've been there, I survived.",S03E18,49
So just take my advice.,S03E18,50
"Hang in there, baby",S03E18,51
Things are crazy.,S03E18,52
But I know your future's bright.,S03E18,53
"Hang in there, baby,",S03E18,54
There's no maybe.,S03E18,55
Everything turns out all right.,S03E18,56
Sure life is up and down.,S03E18,57
"But trust me, it comes back around.",S03E18,58
You're gonna love who you turn out to be.,S03E18,59
"Hang in there, baby.",S03E18,60
"- Hey, dad.",S03E18,61
"- Hey, honey.",S03E18,62

"Oh, I'm I'm sorry.",S03E18,69
That's okay.,S03E18,70
Happens all the time.,S03E18,71
Some people just don't stand out in a crowd.,S03E18,72
Or in a group of two.,S03E18,73
"Well, I won't forget you again.",S03E18,74
"All right, girls. So what you working on?",S03E18,75
"Oh, it's a it's an assignment for our business and marketing class.",S03E18,76
"Basically, come up with a product idea",S03E18,77
then pitch it to the group.,S03E18,78
Oh! I got I got a good idea for a product.,S03E18,79
"Let me guess, it's the corn chips that clean your teeth while you eat them?",S03E18,80
Did I mention they come in different flavors?,S03E18,81
"Bye, dad.",S03E18,82
- Dentitos.,S03E18,83
"- Bye, dad.",S03E18,84
"So, let's talk.",S03E18,85
Let's talk ideas.,S03E18,86

"- So, uh, what'd you come up with?  - It's your house, you go first.",S03E18,88
Okay.,S03E18,89
"Um, so my idea is pajamas with a fun twist.",S03E18,90
"Basically, they're footie pajamas that you decorate yourself.",S03E18,91
Introducing,S03E18,92
Graffooties!,S03E18,93
Wow.,S03E18,94
"Man, that is so weird.",S03E18,95
What is?,S03E18,96
I had the exact same idea.,S03E18,97
"I mean, I don't have a drawing, or like a name,",S03E18,98
"but everything else, exactly the same.",S03E18,99
"You don't have an idea, do you?",S03E18,100
"No, ma'am.",S03E18,101
I do not.,S03E18,102

What have you been doing all week?,S03E18,104
Congratulating myself for picking you as my partner?,S03E18,105
I'm coming.,S03E18,106
I said I'm coming.,S03E18,107
Mom? What are you doing here?,S03E18,108
What am I doing here? I'm dropping off Charlie and Toby.,S03E18,109
I thought Gabe would be the first kid you got rid of.,S03E18,110
"PJ, I'm working at Gabe's school.",S03E18,111
You're gonna have to watch the little ones for a few days.,S03E18,112
I thought I explained all this on the phone to Emmett.,S03E18,113
"- Didn't he give you the message?  - No, he didn't.",S03E18,114
I'm gonna call him.,S03E18,115
Hello?,S03E18,116
"Emmett, did you forget to give me a message?",S03E18,117
Your mom's dropping the kids off.,S03E18,118
- I'll pick them up at 3:30.,S03E18,119

"Hey, you.",S03E18,121
Have fun.,S03E18,122
Okay.,S03E18,123
Is this your house?,S03E18,124

"Well, hello there, kid I don't know.",S03E18,127
"I'm nurse Blankenhooper, what's your name?",S03E18,128
You promised you wouldn't talk to me.,S03E18,129
"Well, I just wanted to let you know that your zipper is down.",S03E18,130
Oh! Made you look.,S03E18,131
I love middle school.,S03E18,132
"- Hey, s'up.",S03E18,133
- S'up.,S03E18,134
I can't believe I have to run the mile in P.,S03E18,135
E.,S03E18,136
today.,S03E18,137
- I hate the mile.,S03E18,138
"- Yeah, me too.",S03E18,139
It totally ruins my hair.,S03E18,140
Someone as cool as you shouldn't have to run the mile.,S03E18,141
"I mean, your name's Walker, not runner.",S03E18,142
Am I right?,S03E18,143
"Don't worry about me, dude.",S03E18,144
I'm not running it.,S03E18,145
How are you gonna get out of it?,S03E18,146
"I've been in eighth grade for three years now, I've picked up some things.",S03E18,147
"Oh, nurse? Over here.",S03E18,148
What's the problem?,S03E18,149
"Oh, the problem is, I just totally barfed.",S03E18,150
Guess I can't go to P.,S03E18,151
E.,S03E18,152
"Wow, that looks like potato soup and fruit punch.",S03E18,153
That's what I ate.,S03E18,154
Guess they had a fight in my stomach.,S03E18,155
Are you sure they were ever in your stomach?,S03E18,156
They seem to have landed in two separate puddles.,S03E18,157
"Yeah. Gnarly, huh?",S03E18,158
"So, guess you'd better write me a note to get out of P.",S03E18,159
E.,S03E18,160
"Yeah, I better.",S03E18,161
Okay.,S03E18,162

Okay.,S03E18,164
I want you to wear this all day.,S03E18,165
Enjoy P.,S03E18,166
E.,S03E18,167

The guy who can't remember my name.,S03E18,171
I remember your name,S03E18,172
Connie.,S03E18,173
Nope.,S03E18,174
"Oh, uh",S03E18,175
"Little bit of bad news, Teddy's got some laryngitis.",S03E18,176
Doctor's said she shouldn't speak for a couple of days.,S03E18,177
A couple days? But what about our presentation?,S03E18,178
"Oh, me?",S03E18,179
No.,S03E18,180
I can't.,S03E18,181
"No, but I've never given a presentation before.",S03E18,182
Wow. Look at this!,S03E18,183
It's like she knows exactly what you're gonna say.,S03E18,184
"Hey, I bet you don't have a card for me.",S03E18,185
And away I go.,S03E18,186
"Oh, uh, good-bye",S03E18,187
Vonnie!,S03E18,188
Can I can I keep the card?,S03E18,189
"Okay, here we go.",S03E18,190
Can I have my balloon back now?,S03E18,191
Whatever.,S03E18,192
"- Hi, PJ.",S03E18,193
"- Hey, Mindy.",S03E18,194
I didn't know you were a babysitter.,S03E18,195
I'm not.,S03E18,196
I'm just watching my brother and sister.,S03E18,197
"Actually, I'm kind of in a bind.",S03E18,198
My nanny just canceled.,S03E18,199
Any chance you could watch the twins for a couple of hours?,S03E18,200
Oh I don't know.,S03E18,201
I'll pay you 15 bucks an hour.,S03E18,202
- Per kid?  - Sure.,S03E18,203
Wow.,S03E18,204
"Let's see, that's 15 bucks an hour times two kids for two hours.",S03E18,205
"Oh, let's see. Carry the one",S03E18,206
Just say yes.,S03E18,207
Yes.,S03E18,208
Okay.,S03E18,209
So here's my new plan.,S03E18,210
"Yesterday's fake puke went on the floor,",S03E18,211
tomorrow's is gonna go all over nurse Blankenhooper.,S03E18,212
You're gonna puke on her?,S03E18,213
Doesn't that seem a little extreme?,S03E18,214
Yeah.,S03E18,215
"We're gonna humiliate her so bad,",S03E18,216
she'll never show her face in this school again.,S03E18,217
"Well, I do like that part.",S03E18,218
"Hey, Teddy. How you feeling?",S03E18,219
Super good and getting better.,S03E18,220
What's all this?,S03E18,221
This is how I'm going to communicate with you today.,S03E18,222
A text-to-speech program.,S03E18,223
Okay.,S03E18,224
Here's the presentation.,S03E18,225
Read this out loud.,S03E18,226
Hi.,S03E18,227

My partner Teddy and I have something very exciting to share with you today.,S03E18,229
Be more excited.,S03E18,230
Give me some sizzle with that steak.,S03E18,231
Hi! I'm Vonnie.,S03E18,232
My partner Teddy and I have something very exciting to share with you!,S03E18,233
Stop.,S03E18,234
You're killing me.,S03E18,235
Hey.,S03E18,236
Don't take that tone with me.,S03E18,237
This is the only tone I have.,S03E18,238
I can't do this.,S03E18,239
Let's just give up.,S03E18,240
What is wrong with you?,S03E18,241
Are you a loser?,S03E18,242
Hey! I'm not a loser! You're a loser!,S03E18,243
That's it.,S03E18,244
Use that passion tomorrow.,S03E18,245
"You'll nail it, Connie.",S03E18,246
"Sorry, typo.",S03E18,247
Vonnie.,S03E18,248
"Little Lambs Babysitting Service, taking good care of your kids since",S03E18,249
Yesterday.,S03E18,250
"Yes, we are fully licensed.",S03E18,251
I've been driving for two years.,S03E18,252
Hello?,S03E18,253
"PJ, this babysitting thing is a gold mine.",S03E18,254

"Fun in leaps, and fun in bounds.",S03E18,271
And now it's time to sing about sounds.,S03E18,272
- A car goes- Beep.,S03E18,273

Wait.,S03E18,281
Shh shh shh shh.,S03E18,282

"Hey, kids. How about a field trip to bathroom land?",S03E18,284
- Yay!  - Woo!,S03E18,285
"Hey, come on.",S03E18,286
Silent trip.,S03E18,287
Silent trip.,S03E18,288
Verna!,S03E18,289
Who's making all the noise?,S03E18,290
I heard kids. You got kids in here?,S03E18,291
No.,S03E18,292
No kids.,S03E18,293
Just us.,S03E18,294

"We're just two young guys who like to drink juice from boxes,",S03E18,296
while wearing matching shirts.,S03E18,297
- It's relaxing.,S03E18,298
- Yeah.,S03E18,299
"Well, I hope you're not running some kind of babysitting service.",S03E18,300
Because that is against building regulations.,S03E18,301
"Babysitting service? Oh, that's ridiculous.",S03E18,302
"No, it's just me and Emmett.",S03E18,303
Somebody in your bathroom?,S03E18,304
"Mm-mm, no, it's uh, the toilet's broken.",S03E18,305
"Yeah, we're having this delayed flushing issue.",S03E18,306
It's very upsetting.,S03E18,307
"When I do my business, I like it to be gone immediately.",S03E18,308
"Well, thanks for stopping by.",S03E18,309
I'll grab my tools and be right back.,S03E18,310
Okay.,S03E18,311

"Nothing, it's just",S03E18,323
You look kind of tired.,S03E18,324
What? That's ridiculous.,S03E18,325
I feel great.,S03E18,326
Took a three hour nap in the nurse's office today.,S03E18,327
"Kids kept banging on the door, I was out.",S03E18,328
I think you should take tomorrow off.,S03E18,329
Why?,S03E18,330
"Well, you've heard of bring your kid to work day?",S03E18,331
"Well, tomorrow's keep your mom at home day.",S03E18,332
"Come on, Gabe.",S03E18,333
You're better than that.,S03E18,334
"Oh, just stay home.",S03E18,335
I'm desperate.,S03E18,336
What is going on?,S03E18,337
"Well, I'm going through the worst dilemma of my life.",S03E18,338
"It's you versus being cool, and",S03E18,339
I can't believe I'm picking you.,S03E18,340
"Okay, Gabe. What's going on?",S03E18,341
"Well, you didn't hear this from me, but",S03E18,342
There's a good chance you're getting puked on tomorrow by Walker.,S03E18,343
I'm getting puked on and you struggled to tell me?,S03E18,344
This kid throws really cool parties.,S03E18,345
- I gave birth do you!  - That was a long time ago!,S03E18,346
"Look, can you please just not come to school tomorrow?",S03E18,347
Okay.,S03E18,348
"Okay, so I don't go in tomorrow.",S03E18,349
What about Thursday and Friday?,S03E18,350
When does it end?,S03E18,351
Saturday.,S03E18,352
- Easy.,S03E18,353
Easy.,S03E18,354
- Okay.,S03E18,355
Perfect.,S03E18,356
It's open.,S03E18,357
Here to fix the toilet.,S03E18,358
Bathroom's right over there.,S03E18,359
- Was that there before?  - Was what there before?,S03E18,360
The giant pile of clothes.,S03E18,361
Laundry day.,S03E18,362
Yeah.,S03E18,363
"You drink as much juice as we do,you're gonna have a lot of laundry.",S03E18,364
"Well, shouldn't you get started with your wash?",S03E18,365
Uh,S03E18,366

Let's get started.,S03E18,371
Aah aah aah!,S03E18,372
Hello.,S03E18,373
Turns out laryngitis is contagious.,S03E18,374
"Oh, no.",S03E18,375
Our presentation is in one hour.,S03E18,376
What are we going to do?,S03E18,377
"Oh, hey girls. What's up?",S03E18,378
I have an idea.,S03E18,379
I have the same idea.,S03E18,380
You go first.,S03E18,381
Bob: Hi.,S03E18,382

"My partner, Vonnie and I have something very exciting to share with you today.",S03E18,384
We take you to a sleepover,S03E18,385
Somewhere in the U.,S03E18,386

Ding dong.,S03E18,389
"Hey, girl! Thanks for the sleepover.",S03E18,390
No prob.,S03E18,391
That's what besties do.,S03E18,392
I just wish there was some way we could wake up this slumber party.,S03E18,393
"Well now, there is.",S03E18,394
Yeah yeah yeah yeah!,S03E18,395
With Graffooties!,S03E18,396

Wow! That combines the two things girls love best.,S03E18,398
Drawing and sleepwear.,S03E18,399
Now together in one super fun package.,S03E18,400
Omg.,S03E18,401
Bff.,S03E18,402

Ha ha ha.,S03E18,404
Hee hee hee.,S03E18,405
Ho ho ho.,S03E18,406
Graffooties.,S03E18,407
They make bedtime a blast.,S03E18,408
Yeah yeah yeah yeah!,S03E18,409
"Ah, there's Blankenhooper.",S03E18,410
"Now, Gabe. Remember what to do?",S03E18,411
Yeah.,S03E18,412
I distract her while you take a big swig of mushroom soup.,S03E18,413
And then boom.,S03E18,414
I get her right in the face.,S03E18,415
"Oh, nurse?",S03E18,416
I don't feel so good.,S03E18,417
"- Oh, no.",S03E18,418
"What's wrong?  - Oh, I feel nauseous.",S03E18,419
Oh.,S03E18,420
Nurse!,S03E18,421
Look over there.,S03E18,422
Something medical looks like it's happening.,S03E18,423
"Hey, don't distract me, kid.",S03E18,424
Can't you see that this boy here is very ill?,S03E18,425
"Fortunately, I've come prepared.",S03E18,426
- What's that?  - Your anti-nausea shot.,S03E18,427
Uh I don't need it.,S03E18,428
"Actually, I'm feeling a whole lot better now.",S03E18,429
"Oh, no.",S03E18,430
That means the puke is eating your brain.,S03E18,431
I'm gonna have to give you this shot right in your head.,S03E18,432
- In my head?  - In your head.,S03E18,433
"First, of course, I'm gonna have to shave your hair.",S03E18,434
What? No!,S03E18,435
Here we go,S03E18,436
Mmm!,S03E18,437
Spaghetti.,S03E18,438
Okay.,S03E18,439
"All right, Charlie.",S03E18,440
Uh.,S03E18,441
"Well, Teddy still can't talk so",S03E18,442
"Uh, dad's gonna fill in for the video diary.",S03E18,443
"So, uh",S03E18,444
"Good luck, Charlie.",S03E18,445
What? I thought that was pretty good.,S03E18,446
We all right.,S03E18,447
We okay.,S03E18,448
"Uh, Charlie, I guess I'm supposed to say more. So uh",S03E18,449
"All right, well uh",S03E18,450
"Okay, so this week, uh, Teddy learned a very valuable lesson",S03E18,451
About um uh,S03E18,452
Being yourself?,S03E18,453
Telling the truth?,S03E18,454
Going for it?,S03E18,455
Teamwork?,S03E18,456
Teamwork!,S03E18,457
Teamwork.,S03E18,458
Because oh oh oh oh!,S03E18,459
"Because if you don't work as a team, then the team don't work.",S03E18,460
Huh? How about that.,S03E18,461
"That come on, that's pretty good.",S03E18,462
I got a bunch of that.,S03E18,463
"Good luck, Charlie.",S03E18,464
What am I gonna do?,S03E18,465
"Ever since the presentation, my voice has been like this.",S03E18,466
You think you got problems?,S03E18,467
I got kicked off my bowling team because of this.,S03E18,468
"Hey, guys.",S03E18,469
Something really strange is going on around here.,S03E18,470
Tell me about it.,S03E18,471
"I know at this age my voice is supposed to change, but not into my mom's!",S03E18,472
What are you doing here?,S03E18,473
I'm just here to fix the toilet.,S03E18,474
Uh-oh! Dad's here.,S03E19,0
Donuts! Run for your lives!,S03E19,1
Up top.,S03E19,2
It's not funny anymore.,S03E19,3
Dad's lost a bunch of weight.,S03E19,4
"Thanks a lot, dad.",S03E19,5
You got skinny and killed all my best material.,S03E19,6
"Actually, I've lost so much weight,",S03E19,7
I gotta start buying my clothes in a regular store now.,S03E19,8
No more Benny's Huge and Bald?,S03E19,9
Lenny's Big and Tall.,S03E19,10
But I love Lenny's.,S03E19,11
It's the only store with steel-reinforced dressing rooms.,S03E19,12
The only store where the freight entrance is also the main entrance.,S03E19,13
"Okay, wait wait.",S03E19,14
"Okay, I got one.",S03E19,15
It's the only store where the large sizes are big and the small ones,S03E19,16
Aren't.,S03E19,17
"Yeah, I guess I don't got one.",S03E19,18
All right.,S03E19,19
I'm off to the Mall.,S03E19,20
Wow.,S03E19,21
Shopping without shame.,S03E19,22
This is gonna be different.,S03E19,23
"Hey, dad.",S03E19,24
Just don't get a hairpiece.,S03E19,25
"I mean, you gotta leave me something.",S03E19,26
Where the big people are so fat,S03E19,27
- P.,S03E19,28
J.,S03E19,29
", we're done.",S03E19,30
- Okay.,S03E19,31
Today's all burnt toast ,S03E19,32
"Running late, and dad jokes",S03E19,33
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S03E19,34
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S03E19,35
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S03E19,36
There it is up on the roof.,S03E19,37
"I've been there, I survived.",S03E19,38
So just take my advice.,S03E19,39
"Hang in there, baby",S03E19,40
Things are crazy,S03E19,41
But I know your future's bright.,S03E19,42
"Hang in there, baby",S03E19,43
There's no maybe,S03E19,44
Everything turns out all right.,S03E19,45
Sure life is up and down.,S03E19,46
"But trust me, it comes back around.",S03E19,47
You're gonna love who you turn out to be.,S03E19,48
"Hang in there, baby.",S03E19,49
Great news! Remember that play I wrote?,S03E19,50
- The dancing Princess?  - Yeah.,S03E19,51
My theater group is doing the production and Ivy's directing.,S03E19,52
And I'm starring?,S03E19,53
- No.,S03E19,54
- Oh.,S03E19,55
Then what's the great news?,S03E19,56
"Well, you're not in this one, mom, but guess who is.",S03E19,57
Charlie!,S03E19,58
I'm gonna be a Princess.,S03E19,59
Good for you.,S03E19,60
Hope show business doesn't break your heart as it did mine.,S03E19,61
"Hey, Charlie. Why is that bear still on the floor?",S03E19,62
I asked you to pick that up an hour ago.,S03E19,63
"Hey, Princess.",S03E19,64
I'm not gonna ask you again.,S03E19,65
Pick up the bear now.,S03E19,66
No.,S03E19,67
She's been like this all day.,S03E19,68
Mom. If I may,S03E19,69
"Charlie, sweetie.",S03E19,70
"Could you pick up that bear for your big sister, please?",S03E19,71
Okay.,S03E19,72
"If you need her to do anything else, just let me know.",S03E19,73
She's three years old.,S03E19,74
You got lucky.,S03E19,75
No no.,S03E19,76
It's not luck.,S03E19,77
Charlie and I have a special sister bond.,S03E19,78
I guess you could call me The Charlie Whisperer.,S03E19,79
The Charlie Whisperer.,S03E19,80
"Okay. Well, if you're so good, why don't you get her to come out of your room?",S03E19,81
I did that one with my mind.,S03E19,82
What you working on?,S03E19,83
"Oh, it's for English.",S03E19,84
I have to write a report about an old person.,S03E19,85
My neighbor Bert By Gabe Duncan.,S03E19,86
"Bert Doogan Husband, Father",S03E19,87
Astronaut?,S03E19,88
Whoa!,S03E19,89
I didn't know grumpy old Bert was an Astronaut.,S03E19,90
Neither does grumpy old Bert.,S03E19,91
I made the whole thing up.,S03E19,92
It was either that or actually talking to the old dude.,S03E19,93
"Whenever I mow Bert's lawn,",S03E19,94
he tells me stories about his adventures in space.,S03E19,95
"There was this one time where his rocket sprung a leak and he fixed it,",S03E19,96
with toothpaste and moon rocks.,S03E19,97
"Come on, dude! No one's gonna believe that.",S03E19,98
"What, the moon rocks?",S03E19,99
"No, that you mowed somebody's lawn.",S03E19,100
Oh!,S03E19,101
"Oh, there's my favorite playwright.",S03E19,102
There's my favorite Director!,S03E19,103
This is so exciting.,S03E19,104
I didn't even know you wanted to direct.,S03E19,105
"Are you kidding? I talk loud, I like to boss people around",S03E19,106
I'm a natural.,S03E19,107
Now let's talk casting.,S03E19,108
Yes!,S03E19,109
Okay.,S03E19,110
"Well, uh, at least we know who's gonna play the young Princess",S03E19,111
- Charlie.,S03E19,112
- Whoa.,S03E19,113
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.,S03E19,114
Charlie's got to audition like everybody else.,S03E19,115
"Okay, I get it.",S03E19,116
You want me to bring Charlie in for an,S03E19,117
Audition.,S03E19,118
"Yes, I",S03E19,119
Do.,S03E19,120
"Ivy, look. It's just one line and",S03E19,121
I wrote it for Charlie.,S03E19,122
"And if she can say it, she gets the part.",S03E19,123
Hello.,S03E19,124
Mrs.,S03E19,125
"Duncan, please stop calling me.",S03E19,126
You cannot be in the play.,S03E19,127
"Hey, guys.",S03E19,128
What was that?,S03E19,129
"Uh Bob, honey?",S03E19,130
Could you come out here please?,S03E19,131
Whatcha wearing?,S03E19,132
"What, this?",S03E19,133
Got it at the Mall.,S03E19,134
"Yeah, some regular store.",S03E19,135
Whatever.,S03E19,136
"Oh, the place was called Cloz, with a Z.",S03E19,137
Cloz?,S03E19,138
I shop there.,S03E19,139
At least I used to.,S03E19,140
"Ooh, question about this Cloz with a Z",S03E19,141
"Um, do they have mirrors or lights?",S03E19,142
"All right, all right.",S03E19,143
"All right, fine.",S03E19,144
I know what you're thinking.,S03E19,145
"Hey, at first, I wasn't sure about this new look either. But you know what?",S03E19,146
Everybody kept complimenting me.,S03E19,147
Really?,S03E19,148
"Yeah, they said I was making it work.",S03E19,149
Rockin' that outfit.,S03E19,150
"Oh, yeah Killin' those jeans.",S03E19,151
Not sure that last one was a compliment.,S03E19,152
And those are the kind of uplifting stories,S03E19,153
my neighbor Bert tells me whenever my brother P.,S03E19,154
J.,S03E19,155
Mows his lawn.,S03E19,156
"Gabe, that was wonderful.",S03E19,157
Thank you.,S03E19,158
"No, thank you for giving me the assignment.",S03E19,159
"You know, Bert sounds like an incredible man.",S03E19,160
Do you think he could come in and speak to the class?,S03E19,161
Um you know,S03E19,162
I don't think that's a good idea.,S03E19,163
He's not moving around very well anymore.,S03E19,164
Astronauting is very hard on the knees.,S03E19,165
"Well, if you bring him in, I'll give you extra credit.",S03E19,166
And it could bring your grade up to an A.,S03E19,167
Huh.,S03E19,168
An A in English.,S03E19,169
Woo! Can't ask for more better than that.,S03E19,170
Next!,S03E19,171
"Okay. For the role of the young Princess,",S03E19,172
presenting Charlie Duncan.,S03E19,173
"Hi, Charlie.",S03E19,174
"Okay, Charlie, say the line.",S03E19,175
"Charlie, hey.",S03E19,176
"Charlie, remember, your line is",S03E19,177
"Your majesty, I was born to dance.",S03E19,178
Okay? Now you say it.,S03E19,179
I turned my ears off.,S03E19,180
"Here, just can you give us a minute?",S03E19,181
Okay.,S03E19,182
Who's next?,S03E19,183
"Hi, I'm Tammy.",S03E19,184
"Hi, Tammy.",S03E19,185
Whenever you're ready.,S03E19,186
"Your majesty, I was born to dance.",S03E19,187
"Tammy, that was very good.",S03E19,188
Wow. What did you think?,S03E19,189
A little show-offy for my taste.,S03E19,190
"Oh, come on! She's fantastic.",S03E19,191
"Yeah, I don't know. I mean, yeah sure, she can act and dance and say the line,",S03E19,192
"but once you take that away, then what do you have?",S03E19,193
Charlie.,S03E19,194
Okay.,S03E19,195
We have got two great candidates for the role of the young Princess.,S03E19,196
Let's just compare them objectively.,S03E19,197
Charlie versus,S03E19,198
Hammy.,S03E19,199
Tammy.,S03E19,200
"Oh, it's too late.",S03E19,201
I've already wrote a Hammy.,S03E19,202
Okay! First category,S03E19,203
Cuteness.,S03E19,204
"Well, Charlie gets a 10.",S03E19,205
No no question there.,S03E19,206
"And, uh, Tammy",S03E19,207
Let's be generous and give her a five.,S03E19,208
A five?,S03E19,209
Is that too high? I'll make it a four.,S03E19,210
"Okay, next category personality.",S03E19,211
- Tammy has a nice smile.,S03E19,212
- With dead shark eyes.,S03E19,213
I'll make it another four.,S03E19,214
Charlie gets a 10.,S03E19,215
How about the ability to say lines?,S03E19,216
Oh.,S03E19,217
Yeah.,S03E19,218
"There is some, uh.",S03E19,219
There is some debate there.,S03E19,220
You know what? Let's just give them each a five.,S03E19,221
And there you have it! Charlie is the clear-cut winner!,S03E19,222
"Oh, Teddy! Come on!",S03E19,223
But the numbers don't lie.,S03E19,224
I didn't just make them up.,S03E19,225
"Yes, you did!",S03E19,226
"Ivy, I will get her to say the line.",S03E19,227
I'm The Charlie Whisperer.,S03E19,228
All right.,S03E19,229
She's got the part.,S03E19,230
I don't know how I'm gonna explain this to Tammy.,S03E19,231
Don't worry about Tammy.,S03E19,232
She's gonna get tons of parts.,S03E19,233
She's amazing.,S03E19,234
"- Ooh, cookies.",S03E19,235
"- Hey, they're not for you.",S03E19,236
- They're for Bert.  - Bert's coming over?,S03E19,237
"Yeah, and can you stick around? You have a way with old people.",S03E19,238
"Usually, it creeps me out, but now I need you.",S03E19,239
Hey! Bert! Come on in.,S03E19,240
I've been living across the street from you people for 20 years,S03E19,241
and I've never been invited over.,S03E19,242
We're shy.,S03E19,243
Shy? I hear that mother of yours singing and dancing all the time!,S03E19,244
"- Women, huh, Bert?  - Hey, tell me about it.",S03E19,245
Cookie?,S03E19,246
"Yeah, sure.",S03E19,247
That is a nice cardigan.,S03E19,248
They don't make them like that anymore.,S03E19,249
You got that right.,S03E19,250
"Now you, I like.",S03E19,251
"Anyhoo, Bert.",S03E19,252
I was wondering if you could come to my class,S03E19,253
and talk about your amazing career.,S03E19,254
Amazing? I was a Mailman.,S03E19,255
Good stuff.,S03E19,256
Good stuff.,S03E19,257
But let me just suggest one small,S03E19,258
A little tiny tweak.,S03E19,259
"Instead of Mailman, let's use a different word.",S03E19,260
Letter carrier?,S03E19,261
I was thinking Astronaut.,S03E19,262
You want me to lie?,S03E19,263
What's wrong with being a Mailman?,S03E19,264
Nothing.,S03E19,265
"It's just that the kids these days, they're not as easily entertained.",S03E19,266
"What with the video games, the gizmos and the gadgets.",S03E19,267
"We're losing our country, Bert.",S03E19,268
That's what I always say when I'm talking to my radio.,S03E19,269
So so you'll do it?,S03E19,270
No! I'm not gonna lie about my job.,S03E19,271
What will you lie about?,S03E19,272
Your vacations? And could one of them possibly have been to Jupiter?,S03E19,273
Are you off your nut?,S03E19,274
Who raised you anyway?,S03E19,275
"Hey, Bert.",S03E19,276
"Okay, it's not your fault.",S03E19,277
"Charlie, it's just one line.",S03E19,278
Say it with me.,S03E19,279
"Your majesty, I was born to dance.",S03E19,280
"Charlie, come on, please.",S03E19,281
"Hey, girls. What's going on?",S03E19,282
I can't get Charlie to say her line.,S03E19,283
Why don't you just do it with your mind?,S03E19,284
"If you're done mocking me, I could really use your help here.",S03E19,285
"Oh, sweetheart.",S03E19,286
I'll never be done mocking you.,S03E19,287
"Okay, relax.",S03E19,288
I have an idea.,S03E19,289
"Okay, Charlie.",S03E19,290
We're gonna read a fun new book.,S03E19,291
"It's called your majesty, I was born to dance.",S03E19,292
Ohh! That sounds like a great title. You wanna say that?,S03E19,293
"Yeah, do you wanna say it like the Princess in the book?",S03E19,294
That's a dog.,S03E19,295
"Well, it's a doggy Princess with an invisible tiara.",S03E19,296
I want another book.,S03E19,297
"Come on, Charlie.",S03E19,298
You can say the line.,S03E19,299
"Your majesty, I was born to dance.",S03E19,300
"Your majesty, I was born to dance.",S03E19,301
Oh! Who's The Charlie Whisperer now?,S03E19,302
"All right, here he is Bert Doogan, famous Astronaut.",S03E19,303
"Well, Bert.",S03E19,304
Thank you so much for joining us.,S03E19,305
Why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself?,S03E19,306
Could Bert take off his helmet?,S03E19,307
"Uh, no.",S03E19,308
Next question.,S03E19,309
So we have a speaker who can't actually speak?,S03E19,310
"Okay, kids. Let's all line up and we can all touch Bert's helmet,",S03E19,311
and then he'll be on his way.,S03E19,312
I'll go first.,S03E19,313
"Gabe, who is this?",S03E19,314
"It's Bert, my neighbor.",S03E19,315
Bert looks surprisingly young.,S03E19,316
"Oh, thank you, dear.",S03E19,317
That's sweet of you to say.,S03E19,318
"Gabe, I want the truth.",S03E19,319
Okay. The truth is that,S03E19,320
"On his last mission, Bert went through a wormhole sending him back in time.",S03E19,321
"Gabe Duncan, I should have known better.",S03E19,322
"- You know, you really should have.",S03E19,323
"- Well, I should get going.",S03E19,324
To infinity and beyond!,S03E19,325
"Oh hey, hon'.",S03E19,326
Hey! There's my baby boy.,S03E19,327
"Um, Bob, hon', you",S03E19,328
- You missing something? - Wha oh! This?,S03E19,329
"Aw, I just decided to update the work threads.",S03E19,330
"Well, sweetie.",S03E19,331
You're an exterminator. Isn't the point of your uniform,S03E19,332
to protect you from things that sting and bite?,S03E19,333
"Hey, these cannons are my protection.",S03E19,334
Oh.,S03E19,335
Daddy's gone crazy.,S03E19,336
Mama's gonna fix it.,S03E19,337
- Hey. - Where have you been?,S03E19,338
- And where's Charlie? - She's at home.,S03E19,339
- What?! - She refused to come.,S03E19,340
"And then when I asked her nicely,",S03E19,341
she turned off her ears and she ran away from me.,S03E19,342
How could you do this to me?,S03E19,343
"Look, it's not completely my fault.",S03E19,344
Okay? A good Director would have chosen Tammy!,S03E19,345
"Teddy, the",S03E19,346
The young Princess goes on in two minutes. What are we gonna do?,S03E19,347
I'll take care of it.,S03E19,348
"Your majesty, I was born to dance!",S03E19,349
Hey. What's going on?,S03E19,350
"Vern, what are you doing here?",S03E19,351
"I'm here because I love you, man.",S03E19,352
Uh-oh.,S03E19,353
"Bob, honey.",S03E19,354
Come here.,S03E19,355
Have a seat next to me.,S03E19,356
"Now, sweetie, we have some things we'd like to say,",S03E19,357
so please just hear us out.,S03E19,358
Teddy? You start.,S03E19,359
"Dad, I miss the old you.",S03E19,360
"You know, the normal guy whose clothes aren't tighter than mine.",S03E19,361
Okay.,S03E19,362
P.,S03E19,363
J.,S03E19,364
Dad,S03E19,365
I want us to shop at different stores.,S03E19,366
I don't want us to have the same pants.,S03E19,367
"For the record, I love your new look!",S03E19,368
It's a comedic gold mine.,S03E19,369
"- For instance - Uh, uh, thank you, Gabe.",S03E19,370
Vern?,S03E19,371
Would you like to share?,S03E19,372
"Look at me, boss.",S03E19,373
I had to expose my flesh to the enemy just so you could show off your guns.,S03E19,374
"What's going on, Bob?",S03E19,375
Are you having some sort of a mid-life crisis?,S03E19,376
No!,S03E19,377
I,S03E19,378
All right.,S03E19,379
"A couple of months ago I'm in the park with Toby and, uh",S03E19,380
Somebody thought I was his grandfather.,S03E19,381
So you went through all of this,S03E19,382
because of some off-handed comment from a stranger?,S03E19,383
Yeah!,S03E19,384
"But it guys, it inspired me to lose weight, get in shape.",S03E19,385
And your new body is great.,S03E19,386
What you've chosen to put on your new body,S03E19,387
Not so great.,S03E19,388
Dad.,S03E19,389
Will you accept our help and return those clothes today?,S03E19,390
There's a car waiting outside to take you to an age-appropriate store.,S03E19,391
"All right, fine.",S03E19,392
I'll go.,S03E19,393
"But, um you're gonna have to give me",S03E19,394
20 minutes to get out of these pants.,S03E19,395
"Well, Charlie.",S03E19,396
"Dad returned all the clothes, so there's one less teenager in the house.",S03E19,397
And in other news,S03E19,398
Hey! Keep it down in there!,S03E19,399
"Gabe got in trouble at school,",S03E19,400
so now he has to interview our neighbor Bert for real.,S03E19,401
Now where was I?,S03E19,402
1983.,S03E19,403
1983.,S03E19,404
The first-class stamp cost 20 cents.,S03E19,405
And the zip plus-four code was established.,S03E19,406
Now the Z.,S03E19,407
P.,S03E19,408
4.,S03E19,409
"Code,.",S03E19,410
was originally supposed to be just a Z.,S03E19,411
P.,S03E19,412
3.,S03E19,413
"Now this is where it gets complicated, so just stay with me.",S03E19,414
It looks like Gabe's gonna be there a while.,S03E19,415
"Wish him good luck, Charlie.",S03E19,416
"All right, Vern. You wanna look good",S03E19,417
"in that uniform, we gotta get you into shape.",S03E19,418
All right.,S03E19,419
"Now before we begin, we need to stretch out.",S03E19,420
You are limber!,S03E19,421
"All right, let's try some sit-ups.",S03E19,422
Now watch my technique.,S03E19,423
"All right, your turn.",S03E19,424
Vern? You okay?,S03E19,425
"I think I did a little bit too much too fast, boss.",S03E19,426
"Good morning, mom.",S03E20,0
Oh.,S03E20,1
"Gabe, honey.",S03E20,2
We need to talk.,S03E20,3
"Mom, I didn't do it! That Principal's out to get me.",S03E20,4
It's not about the Principal.,S03E20,5
"Mom, I didn't do it! That teacher is out to get me.",S03E20,6
Gabe! You're not in trouble.,S03E20,7
Then why do we need to talk?,S03E20,8
"Well, it's about your dad.",S03E20,9
"Now you're aware that he occasionally snores, right?",S03E20,10
"Mom, the people across the street are aware.",S03E20,11
Car alarms are aware.,S03E20,12
Kansas is aware.,S03E20,13
"Well, obviously, I'm used to his snoring",S03E20,14
because I grew up next to train tracks.,S03E20,15
But your father's been waking Toby up,S03E20,16
and I'm trying to get the baby to sleep through the night.,S03E20,17
How does this involve me?,S03E20,18
We're going to have to temporarily change our sleeping arrangements.,S03E20,19
"Man, you're putting Toby in with me?",S03E20,20
Not exactly.,S03E20,21
"Hey, roomie!",S03E20,22
Today's all burnt toast,S03E20,23
Running late and dad jokes,S03E20,24
Has anybody seen my left shoe?,S03E20,25
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S03E20,26
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S03E20,27
There it is up on the roof,S03E20,28
"I've been there, I've survived",S03E20,29
So just take my advice,S03E20,30
"Hang in there, baby",S03E20,31
Things are crazy,S03E20,32
But I know your future's bright,S03E20,33
"Hang in there, baby",S03E20,34
There's no maybe,S03E20,35
Everything turns out all right,S03E20,36
Sure life is up and down,S03E20,37
But trust me it comes back around,S03E20,38
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S03E20,39
"Hang in there, baby.",S03E20,40
Ah,S03E20,41
There he is.,S03E20,42
"Mister Victor Deleseur, ladies and gentlemen.",S03E20,43
The smartest guy at South High.,S03E20,44
"What do you want, Teddy?",S03E20,45
What? Do I always have to want something?,S03E20,46
Can't I just invite you over as a friend to enjoy some,S03E20,47
"Okay, so here it is.",S03E20,48
"Um, I'm taking the SAT this weekend and I really want to ace it.",S03E20,49
"And you want my help, since you know I scored a perfect 2400.",S03E20,50
They actually did a feature story on me in overachievers monthly.,S03E20,51
"Yeah yeah, I know.",S03E20,52
I cut it out and put it in my scrapbook.,S03E20,53
- Really?!  - No.,S03E20,54
"So, what do you say? Will you help me?",S03E20,55
Under one condition,S03E20,56
"If I tutor you,",S03E20,57
you have to agree to do whatever I say no matter what.,S03E20,58
Fine.,S03E20,59
Now just tell me what you want in return.,S03E20,60
Do I always have to want something?,S03E20,61
Can't I just do it out of the goodness,S03E20,62
"Okay, here it is.",S03E20,63
I want you to come to the park with me this Saturday.,S03E20,64
Wait. You mean like a date?,S03E20,65
I would never ask you out.,S03E20,66
"See, you have a boyfriend, I have a girlfriend and most importantly",S03E20,67
I have certain intellectual standards.,S03E20,68
"Insulted, yet relieved.",S03E20,69
So what are we gonna do at the park?,S03E20,70
I have a very important chess match and I'd like you to watch.,S03E20,71
- That's it?  - That's it.,S03E20,72
There's gotta be some sort of catch.,S03E20,73
No catch.,S03E20,74
Just chess.,S03E20,75
Is chess a euphemism for something?,S03E20,76
Like some sort of weird comic book role-playing thing?,S03E20,77
No.,S03E20,78
Okay.,S03E20,79
Fine.,S03E20,80
"If you tutor me, I'll come to the park and I'll watch you play chess.",S03E20,81
"No, not chess.",S03E20,82
Just chess.,S03E20,83
"You mean, chess.",S03E20,84
No! Not chess.,S03E20,85
Just chess!,S03E20,86
This may be the toughest tutoring I've ever done.,S03E20,87
"Oh, that is so yummy. Isn't it good?",S03E20,88
"Charlie, have you ever seen a cuter baby in your life?",S03E20,89
- Yes.  - Who?,S03E20,90
Me.,S03E20,91
You are your mother's daughter.,S03E20,92
"Hi, mom.",S03E20,93
"Hi, Charlie.",S03E20,94
"PJ, I need your help.",S03E20,95
"Sure, mom. What can I do you for?",S03E20,96
"It's a fun little way of saying, what can I do for you?",S03E20,97
Proceed.,S03E20,98
"Okay well, I really need to put Toby down for a nap.",S03E20,99
But Charlie wants me to read to her. can you do it?,S03E20,100
"Oh, yeah.",S03E20,101
Sure.,S03E20,102
I got time for a quick little whoa! Hello.,S03E20,103
- Charlie wants this book? - Would you rather change Toby's diaper?,S03E20,104
"Come on, buddy.",S03E20,105
The Littlest Unicorn.,S03E20,106
By Emily Prettyblossom.,S03E20,107
- Yay.,S03E20,108
- Okay.,S03E20,109
Chapter one.,S03E20,110
"Some people say that unicorns aren't real, but they are.",S03E20,111
They hail from a magical place called Butterflylandia.,S03E20,112
"Oh, boy.",S03E20,113
Keep going.,S03E20,114
"This is the story of one of those unicorns, the littlest one of all.",S03E20,115
Her name was Junie.,S03E20,116
"Her real name, that is.",S03E20,117
Her mean brothers called her Junie the Puny Uni.,S03E20,118
- That's not very nice.,S03E20,119
"- No, it isn't.",S03E20,120
Shh.,S03E20,121
"One day, Junie and her family went to the meadow for a picnic.",S03E20,122
"The meadow was right next to the dark forest,",S03E20,123
a place Junie was forbidden to go.,S03E20,124
But her curiosity got the better of her.,S03E20,125
- Uh-oh.,S03E20,126
- I'm thirsty.,S03E20,127
Suck it up.,S03E20,128
Junie's in trouble.,S03E20,129
"So, what's the answer?",S03E20,130
Uh,S03E20,131
"- C? - No no no, it's B!",S03E20,132
"Well, I was close.",S03E20,133
"Teddy, this is the SAT's, not horseshoes!",S03E20,134
You know what? We've been going at this for a while.,S03E20,135
Maybe we should stop.,S03E20,136
Stop? But the test is Saturday.,S03E20,137
You can't stop now.,S03E20,138
Let's move on to math.,S03E20,139
"- In a parallelogram - Yeah, Victor.",S03E20,140
I don't think I can study anymore.,S03E20,141
I feel like my brain is full.,S03E20,142
"That's the great thing about brains, they never get full.",S03E20,143
Even smaller ones like yours.,S03E20,144
Okay.,S03E20,145
"I'll have you know, my friends consider me very smart.",S03E20,146
You mean like Ivy?,S03E20,147
"Well, and other friends.",S03E20,148
You mean like Spencer?,S03E20,149
Let's get back to work.,S03E20,150
"And as the sun set on the dark forest, Junie realized she would",S03E20,151
have to survive the night alone.,S03E20,152
Are you scared?,S03E20,153
No.,S03E20,154
Me either.,S03E20,155
"Okay, bedtime.",S03E20,156
Five more minutes.,S03E20,157
We wanna finish this chapter.,S03E20,158
"I'm sorry, honey.",S03E20,159
But Charlie needs to go to bed.,S03E20,160
That's the kind of parenting that drove Junie away,S03E20,161
from the green pastures of Butterflylandia.,S03E20,162
"Okay. Well, it's bedtime",S03E20,163
and I'm from the land of I-don't-care-ia.,S03E20,164
"Come on, Charlie.",S03E20,165
And don't worry.,S03E20,166
I won't read ahead without you.,S03E20,167
Promise?,S03E20,168
Promise.,S03E20,169
Good night.,S03E20,170
Good night.,S03E20,171
I said good night.,S03E20,172
Oh.,S03E20,173
Gabe.,S03E20,174
"Yeah, dad?",S03E20,175
"- You awake? - No, dad.",S03E20,176
You wanna talk?,S03E20,177
"No, dad.",S03E20,178
Your mom usually lets me talk about my day a little.,S03E20,179
It helps me fall asleep.,S03E20,180
"Okay, dad.",S03E20,181
How was your day?,S03E20,182
"Well, I was over at Mrs. Fisher's today",S03E20,183
Workin'.,S03E20,184
Had to knock down so many spiderwebs.,S03E20,185
"She finally came up to me and she said,",S03E20,186
"Bob, did you miss a week?",S03E20,187
"I said, no, you just have a lot of spiders.",S03E20,188
Good night.,S03E20,189
Gabe?,S03E20,190
"Dad, if you can't sleep, just watch some TV.",S03E20,191
But it's bedtime.,S03E20,192
Is it?,S03E20,193
Whoa! Whoa whoa!,S03E20,194
TV after bedtime?,S03E20,195
How often you do this?,S03E20,196
Um,S03E20,197
"This is, uh this is my first time, dad.",S03E20,198
"Now, if the semicircle arc AB has the length six times PI.",S03E20,199
And the circumference of the circle with the diameter BC is eight times PI,S03E20,200
What is the area of the shaded region?!,S03E20,201
Um,S03E20,202
B\NB.,S03E20,203
- Wrong! - Oh!,S03E20,204
What are you doing?!,S03E20,205
I'm giving you a punishment to train your brain.,S03E20,206
"Victor, I'm not",S03E20,207
A cat.,S03E20,208
"Well, of course not.",S03E20,209
A cat could have solved that equation.,S03E20,210
It's midnight.,S03E20,211
We're done working.,S03E20,212
We're done? Just because,S03E20,213
It's midnight.,S03E20,214
sobbing,S03E20,215
"Yes, that is what I said.",S03E20,216
Just without the hurtful attitude.,S03E20,217
Am I wasting my time here?,S03E20,218
Do you want this?! I don't think you want this!,S03E20,219
I don't want this.,S03E20,220
Sit down and open that workbook.,S03E20,221
That's it.,S03E20,222
We're done.,S03E20,223
You're fired.,S03E20,224
- Fired? - Yup.,S03E20,225
"Terminated, dismissed, shown the door.",S03E20,226
"Ooh, we're working with synonyms.",S03E20,227
"Yes, we are. Now get out!",S03E20,228
Exit!,S03E20,229
Scram!,S03E20,230
"Man, watching infomercials.",S03E20,231
I've got a kernel stuck in my tooth.,S03E20,232
Doesn't get any better than this.,S03E20,233
Shh shh shh shh.,S03E20,234
Footsteps! Shut it down!,S03E20,235
"Oh, sure.",S03E20,236
In here you don't snore.,S03E20,237
There it is.,S03E20,238
3:10 to Yuma.,S03E20,239
Rise and shine.,S03E20,240
"Victor, I fired you.",S03E20,241
Wrong. The correct answer is C,S03E20,242
I can't be fired.,S03E20,243
Victor.,S03E20,244
It's 6:00 in the morning.,S03E20,245
What in the world are you doing here?,S03E20,246
Where else would I be?,S03E20,247
"Gee, I don't know.",S03E20,248
"Maybe at home, asleep.",S03E20,249
Clutching some kind of a Sci-Fi action figure.,S03E20,250
"Teddy, you agreed to do whatever I said.",S03E20,251
No matter what.,S03E20,252
Welcome to no matter what!,S03E20,253
Are you crazy?,S03E20,254
Crazy about learnin'.,S03E20,255
And that's the only time you'll ever hear me drop a g.,S03E20,256
Listen closely because I'm about to drop a g.,S03E20,257
O away!,S03E20,258
This is good.,S03E20,259
This is good.,S03E20,260
"You're frustrated, you're angry, you're right on schedule.",S03E20,261
Excuse me?,S03E20,262
This happens whenever I'm working with someone.,S03E20,263
There always comes a moment when they want to quit.,S03E20,264
"Actually, your breaking point came later than usual.",S03E20,265
Which means that you're one of my most promising students.,S03E20,266
"-Really?  -Oh, yes.",S03E20,267
I am very impressed.,S03E20,268
"You're a star, Teddy.",S03E20,269
Oh.,S03E20,270
I don't know about star.,S03E20,271
Is my star ready to get to work now?,S03E20,272
Would you stop that?,S03E20,273
I'm gonna get dressed.,S03E20,274
I'll be right back.,S03E20,275
Star.,S03E20,276
"- Hey, mom.",S03E20,277
- Hi.,S03E20,278
Help me out here.,S03E20,279
I'm Mezrab.,S03E20,280
Help me out a little more.,S03E20,281
"I'm Mezrab Magicpenny, the legendary half-wizard, half-unicorn,",S03E20,282
who Junie meets in the dark forest.,S03E20,283
I thought this would help make the story come alive.,S03E20,284
For Charlie?,S03E20,285
"Yeah, okay.",S03E20,286
Yeah.,S03E20,287
"Honey, I'm sorry.",S03E20,288
Charlie's still sleeping.,S03E20,289
"Well, should I wake her up?",S03E20,290
"Yeah, you know what?",S03E20,291
Let's wake up Toby too.,S03E20,292
Make it a party.,S03E20,293
- Okay!  - No! Get back in here!,S03E20,294
I'm kidding.,S03E20,295
You can't read to Charlie this morning.,S03E20,296
She's got preschool.,S03E20,297
"Aw, man. Well, can I at least have some breakfast?",S03E20,298
Sure.,S03E20,299
Have a bagel.,S03E20,300
"What, no cream cheese?",S03E20,301
If you don't know then leave it blank.,S03E20,302
When you score high there's me to thank!,S03E20,303
Geometry is really a breeze.,S03E20,304
Right triangles are 90 degrees.,S03E20,305
"Sound off! One, two!",S03E20,306
PI is 3.,S03E20,307
14.,S03E20,308
"Come on now, let's hear that voice.",S03E20,309
Never guess on multiple choice.,S03E20,310
Go ahead and do one more!,S03E20,311
Eight squared is 64!,S03E20,312
Next time we should take a car.,S03E20,313
I'm not used to running this far.,S03E20,314
What time is it?,S03E20,315
It's 1:00 in the morning.,S03E20,316
Also known as story time.,S03E20,317
"Okay, where were we?",S03E20,318
"Oh, yeah.",S03E20,319
Junie was at the Cave of Shadows.,S03E20,320
"As Junie entered the cave, she was scared, but also very curious.",S03E20,321
She crept ahead cautiously.,S03E20,322
I'm tired.,S03E20,323
"Yeah, well, so was Junie.",S03E20,324
But she keeps going.,S03E20,325
"All-night bowling dad, you're an animal!",S03E20,326
- PJ?!  - Dad?,S03E20,327
"- Where are you going? - Uh, nowhere.",S03E20,328
- Why is Charlie up?  - No reason.,S03E20,329
- Why is Gabe up? - No reason.,S03E20,330
What's with the book?,S03E20,331
What's with the bowling ball?,S03E20,332
None of this ever happened.,S03E20,333
None of what ever happened?,S03E20,334
"Let's go, dad.",S03E20,335
He can keep this up all night.,S03E20,336
Keep what up all night?,S03E20,337
Suddenly two bright green eyes opened wide and lit up the rocky den.,S03E20,338
And Junie stood face-to-face with a giant fire-breathing dragon!,S03E20,339
He opened his mouth and roared,S03E20,340
-PJ?! -Mom!,S03E20,341
What are you doing?,S03E20,342
What are you doing?,S03E20,343
That only works with your dad.,S03E20,344
What's going on here?,S03E20,345
It was Charlie's idea.,S03E20,346
She wanted to finish the book.,S03E20,347
"Oh, okay. So Charlie got up in the middle of the night,",S03E20,348
called you at your apartment and told you to come over for a book sesh?,S03E20,349
She's a scamp.,S03E20,350
"- Come on, Charlie.",S03E20,351
"- Ah, okay.",S03E20,352
"Good night, PJ.",S03E20,353
"Well, what's she doing tomorrow?",S03E20,354
- Preschool.  - Again?,S03E20,355
That's every day now?,S03E20,356
"- Morning, Gabe.",S03E20,357
- I want him out.,S03E20,358
- Who?  - Dad.,S03E20,359
I haven't slept a wink in 48 hours.,S03E20,360
Except a quick little nap during math class.,S03E20,361
Is this about his snoring?,S03E20,362
No! I gave him a taste of freedom and he went crazy.,S03E20,363
Yeah.,S03E20,364
Dad does better with rules.,S03E20,365
Lots and lots of rules.,S03E20,366
I can't do it anymore.,S03E20,367
You gotta take him back.,S03E20,368
Tonight.,S03E20,369
"Calm down, okay?",S03E20,370
This is your dad we're talking about.,S03E20,371
Let's show a little respect.,S03E20,372
We'll flip a coin.,S03E20,373
"- Heads, you're stuck with him.",S03E20,374
"- Tails, he's my problem.",S03E20,375
Deal.,S03E20,376
Please be tails.,S03E20,377
Please be tails.,S03E20,378
Please be tails.,S03E20,379
Hey. Whatcha doing?,S03E20,380
Fighting over you.,S03E20,381
So who won?,S03E20,382
-Aw! Gabe! -Yes!,S03E20,383
Welcome back.,S03E20,384
- Hi.  - So?,S03E20,385
How'd the test go?,S03E20,386
Well.,S03E20,387
"of course I won't know for a while, but I think I did really well.",S03E20,388
"Now, in accordance with our agreement,",S03E20,389
you need to accompany me to my chess match.,S03E20,390
"Right right, the chess match.",S03E20,391
"- Teddy, it's just a chess match.",S03E20,392
- Sure.,S03E20,393
"Okay. Well, what do I have to wear? A bird suit or a robot outfit?",S03E20,394
"Actually, what you have on now is perfect.",S03E20,395
"Come on, Andrew.",S03E20,396
It's your move.,S03E20,397
"It is? Oh, right.",S03E20,398
Checkmate.,S03E20,399
What! No! It can't be!,S03E20,400
"Curse you, Deleseur!",S03E20,401
We're done here.,S03E20,402
"Thank you, Teddy.",S03E20,403
Nerd bait.,S03E20,404
Not my finest hour.,S03E20,405
"Well, Charlie. I got my SAT results back,",S03E20,406
and let's just say I did pretty well.,S03E20,407
I'm trying not to be supercilious.,S03E20,408
Did I use that right?,S03E20,409
Who cares? Test's over.,S03E20,410
"Hey, check it out.",S03E20,411
The sequel to The Littlest Unicorn just came out.,S03E20,412
Revenge of The Littlest Unicorn.,S03E20,413
Have you seen Charlie?,S03E20,414
"Uh, yeah.",S03E20,415
And she told me to tell you that she's not home.,S03E20,416
"Man! Well, who am I supposed to read this to?",S03E20,417
"Hello, Toby!",S03E20,418
"Okay, chapter one.",S03E20,419
Junie had an axe to grind,S03E20,420
Well.,S03E20,421
Sounds like there's gonna be a beat down in Butterflylandia.,S03E20,422
"Better wish Junie some good luck, Charlie.",S03E20,423
"Charlie, are you ready to go to the park now?",S03E20,424
No!,S03E20,425
"PJ, thanks to that stupid book you read her Charlie's afraid to go outside.",S03E20,426
She thinks there's a dragon out there.,S03E20,427
There is.,S03E20,428
Will you please explain to your sister the,S03E20,429
difference between what's real and what's not?,S03E20,430
"Okay, Charlie.",S03E20,431
It's very simple.,S03E20,432
"Unicorns are real, dragons are not.",S03E20,433
Okay. Are you ready to go now?,S03E20,434
No.,S03E20,435
"Okay, mom.",S03E20,436
I got this.,S03E20,437
"Charlie, there is no dragon out there.",S03E20,438
"Look, I'll show you.",S03E20,439
Told you.,S03E20,440
Deck the halls with boughs of Holly.,S03E21,0
Fa la la la la la la la la la.,S03E21,1
'Tis the season,S03E21,2
Hi!,S03E21,3
"Hey, sounding good, Mrs.",S03E21,4
Duncan.,S03E21,5
Oh! I know.,S03E21,6
It's going to sound even better when I sing it tonight,S03E21,7
at the annual Duncan Christmas Eve Talent Show.,S03E21,8
"Oh, mom, Spencer and I are singing too.",S03E21,9
We even worked out a new Christmas song together.,S03E21,10
"Oh, that is so wonderful!",S03E21,11
And so brave of you to sing the same night I do.,S03E21,12
"Well, we're off to Super Christmas Land.",S03E21,13
"Ooh, Super Christmas Land? What's that?",S03E21,14
"Oh, that's what Super Adventure Land calls itself,",S03E21,15
for one week each year at Christmas time.,S03E21,16
Last week it was Super Hanukkah Land.,S03E21,17
Next week it's Super Kwanzaa Land.,S03E21,18
"Merry Christmas, everybody!",S03E21,19
"Oh, grandma's here!",S03E21,20
- Yay. - Oh!,S03E21,21
Oh oh!,S03E21,22
"Charlie, what do you have to say to grandma?",S03E21,23
Good-bye.,S03E21,24
"Sorry, she's just excited.",S03E21,25
We're off to have her very first picture taken with Santa.,S03E21,26
I understand.,S03E21,27
"Okay, well, we gotta run, but we can't wait to see you later.",S03E21,28
"- Oh, good.",S03E21,29
- Okay.,S03E21,30
"- All right, bye.",S03E21,31
- Bye.,S03E21,32
"Oh, Amy.",S03E21,33
It's nice to see you.,S03E21,34
"Oh, Linda, it's nice to see you.",S03E21,35
Well.,S03E21,36
The decorations look nice and whatnot.,S03E21,37
Although that wreath is in the wrong place.,S03E21,38
I like it there.,S03E21,39
I'll fix it later.,S03E21,40
Okay. Bob?,S03E21,41
"- Oh, my goodness! - Mom!",S03E21,42
Is that my son or Hercules?,S03E21,43
"Oh, mom! Please!",S03E21,44
"Dropped some weight, got totally buff.",S03E21,45
Don't make a fuss.,S03E21,46
"So, how was the flight?",S03E21,47
"Oh, you know, the usual delays and whatnot.",S03E21,48
But everybody on the plane loved the song,S03E21,49
that I'm going to sing at the Talent Show.,S03E21,50
Deck the halls with boughs of Holly,S03E21,51
"Oh, whoa whoa whoa whoa!Hang on there, grandma.",S03E21,52
I'm singing Deck The Halls.,S03E21,53
"Sweetheart, maybe you should clean the halls before you deck them.",S03E21,54
I may deck something besides the halls.,S03E21,55
"Okay, stand down.",S03E21,56
We both can't sing the song and I did come all the way from Phoenix.,S03E21,57
She did come all the way from Phoenix.,S03E21,58
"- Well, it's my house.",S03E21,59
- It is her house.,S03E21,60
- I gave birth to you.,S03E21,61
- I married you.,S03E21,62
Ba-bam!.,S03E21,63
"Okay, fine!",S03E21,64
Nobody sings it.,S03E21,65
That's my final decision.,S03E21,66
"Oh, that's your decision?",S03E21,67
Who died and made you King of the Talent Show?,S03E21,68
- Really! - Unbelievable.,S03E21,69
"Yay, Christmas.",S03E21,70
Today's all burnt toast ,S03E21,71
"Running late, and dad jokes",S03E21,72
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S03E21,73
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S03E21,74
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S03E21,75
There it is up on the roof.,S03E21,76
"I've been there, I survived.",S03E21,77
So just take my advice.,S03E21,78
"Hang in there, baby",S03E21,79
Things are crazy,S03E21,80
But I know your future's bright.,S03E21,81
"Hang in there, baby",S03E21,82
There's no maybe,S03E21,83
Everything turns out all right.,S03E21,84
Sure life is up and down.,S03E21,85
"But trust me, it comes back around.",S03E21,86
You're gonna love who you turn out to be.,S03E21,87
"Hang in there, baby.",S03E21,88
"Hey, guys?",S03E21,89
"Uh, listen.",S03E21,90
I need a favor.,S03E21,91
"Well, since we're still in the pre-Christmas gotta-be-nice zone.",S03E21,92
What can we do for you?,S03E21,93
I need you to find out what your mom got me for Christmas.,S03E21,94
"- Why? - Well, because.",S03E21,95
"Every year, your mom and I,we make this agreement",S03E21,96
not to spend too much on each other's presents but,S03E21,97
I never know what that means.,S03E21,98
I would have thought not spending too much,S03E21,99
is a phrase you're very familiar with.,S03E21,100
Every year I wind up getting it wrong.,S03E21,101
"Oh, right, like the time she bought you",S03E21,102
really nice watch and you got her those,S03E21,103
"- Uh, what were they called again? - Slocks.",S03E21,104
"They're not slippers, they're not socks.",S03E21,105
They're Slocks.,S03E21,106
That was the Christmas that mom kept slipping and falling.,S03E21,107
"Slocks they're not just ugly, they're dangerous.",S03E21,108
All right.,S03E21,109
"Come on, guys.",S03E21,110
Hey.,S03E21,111
"When you were doing your present snooping,",S03E21,112
did you happen to see what your mom got me?,S03E21,113
"Dad, I'm older now.",S03E21,114
I don't do that anymore.,S03E21,115
And thanks for the headphones!,S03E21,116
"Well, naughty can't help me.",S03E21,117
Let's try nice.,S03E21,118
"- Ooh, that's me! - Ha ha, PJ!",S03E21,119
"Come on, find out from your mom what she got me.",S03E21,120
"- All right, I'll talk to her.",S03E21,121
"- All right, great.",S03E21,122
She'll tell you anything.,S03E21,123
We all know you're her favorite.,S03E21,124
He is?,S03E21,125
"Well, hey hey hey! I didn't say my favorite.",S03E21,126
"That would be Teddy, right?",S03E21,127
No comment.,S03E21,128
"Oh, relax.",S03E21,129
I'm sure you're in the top five.,S03E21,130
"I know that you're tired and you're hungry and your feet are cold,",S03E21,131
but all this whining doesn't help.,S03E21,132
But it's taking so long!,S03E21,133
When do I get to see Santa?,S03E21,134
"Really soon, I promise.",S03E21,135
"Yeah, if that kid would ever get off Santa's lap.",S03E21,136
He's been on there for like 10 minutes.,S03E21,137
"Yeah, what's taking him so long?",S03E21,138
"It should be sit, list, snap, go.",S03E21,139
"Sit, list, snap, go! How hard is that?",S03E21,140
"Santa can hear you, young lady.",S03E21,141
"Yeah, well, that's kind of the idea, Santa.",S03E21,142
"But seriously, you might want to cool it, all right?",S03E21,143
"- Carl's not the nicest guy. - Wait, you know Santa?",S03E21,144
"Yeah, from when we worked here.",S03E21,145
I did a show with him.,S03E21,146
The tribute to America.,S03E21,147
He played Johnny Appleseed before he put on the weight.,S03E21,148
Santa heard that too.,S03E21,149
"- Hey, mom.",S03E21,150
- Hey.,S03E21,151
What you doing?,S03E21,152
Welding.,S03E21,153
Good good.,S03E21,154
"So, listen, I was thinking about what present to get for dad.",S03E21,155
And I don't want to get him the same thing you did.,S03E21,156
What did you get him again?,S03E21,157
Did your dad send you down here to find out what I got him?,S03E21,158
I'm not prepared for any follow-up questions.,S03E21,159
I'm not going to tell you what I got him.,S03E21,160
Then I won't ask again.,S03E21,161
Am I still your favorite?,S03E21,162
That's why you're my favorite.,S03E21,163
Yes!,S03E21,164
"Well, then I'll let you get back to your welding.",S03E21,165
"- Good news, guys. - You found out what your mom's getting me?",S03E21,166
"No, but I confirmed I'm her favorite.",S03E21,167
"Well, there you go.",S03E21,168
Gonna fail Christmas again.,S03E21,169
Maybe I can help you.,S03E21,170
"You already bought mom a gift, right?",S03E21,171
And I'm guessing it's somewhere in the Slocks area?,S03E21,172
"Actually, I got her a very special foam rug for the kitchen.",S03E21,173
Something she can stand on when she's doing the dishes.,S03E21,174
It's called the foot cush.,S03E21,175
"Oh, so you want the Slocks to seem like the good old days.",S03E21,176
"Wow, dad, you set the bar so low, I can't believe you went under it.",S03E21,177
- Good one.,S03E21,178
- Thank you.,S03E21,179
I like yours too.,S03E21,180
"Guys, I'm just trying to be thoughtful.",S03E21,181
"Look, your mom saw a foot cushion in a store once,",S03E21,182
and she said she might like one.,S03E21,183
"All right, so the point is you got the cheap gift covered.",S03E21,184
Now all you have to do is buy mom a nice gift.,S03E21,185
Buy her two gifts?,S03E21,186
Exactly. Then hide them in different places,S03E21,187
"and after you open mom's gift to you,",S03E21,188
you'll know which one to give her.,S03E21,189
Gabe! That's genius. Eh?,S03E21,190
There you go.,S03E21,191
That's why you're my favorite.,S03E21,192
This whole favorite thing is starting to lose all meaning.,S03E21,193
Yes.,S03E21,194
"We're next, Charlie.",S03E21,195
"Teddy, look.",S03E21,196
Back in one hour?!,S03E21,197
You can't do that.,S03E21,198
"Sorry, missy, I get a one hour break every four hours I work.",S03E21,199
Union rules.,S03E21,200
- What Union? - H.,S03E21,201
A.,S03E21,202
G.,S03E21,203
The Holiday Actors Guild.,S03E21,204
"No no, wait.",S03E21,205
"Come on, come on.",S03E21,206
"Look, we've been waiting here for two hours.",S03E21,207
"Okay, we're hungry, we're tired",S03E21,208
Take it up with H.,S03E21,209
A.,S03E21,210
G.,S03E21,211
now get out of my way.,S03E21,212
"You're not going anywhere, Santa.",S03E21,213
Try and stop me.,S03E21,214
Ha ha ha!,S03E21,215
Whoops!,S03E21,216
"Oh, Teddy.",S03E21,217
Yes!,S03E21,218
Let's get the picture.,S03E21,219
"Here, I'll hold Santa's arms down.",S03E21,220
Step away from the fat man.,S03E21,221
Well well well.,S03E21,222
If it isn't Teddy Duncan.,S03E21,223
"Howdy, Sheriff.",S03E21,224
Merry Christmas.,S03E21,225
You redecorated.,S03E21,226
Place looks good.,S03E21,227
We try to give it a holiday feel.,S03E21,228
"- Hey, honey. - Oh, Bob?",S03E21,229
"Um, I've decided I'm not going to sing Deck The Halls at the Talent Show.",S03E21,230
"Really? Oh, thank you.",S03E21,231
Thank you for taking the high road and keeping the peace.,S03E21,232
I'm going to do an impression instead.,S03E21,233
- An impression? - Mmm.,S03E21,234
Of a family member. Can you guess who?,S03E21,235
I flew all the way in from Phoenix and whatnot.,S03E21,236
"And, oh oh!",S03E21,237
Bobby is so muscley and whatnot.,S03E21,238
Oh.,S03E21,239
"Hey, mom.",S03E21,240
"Um, how much did you hear?.",S03E21,241
I didn't hear a thing.,S03E21,242
I just wanted to tell you that I've decided to,S03E21,243
let Amy sing Deck The Halls this year.,S03E21,244
"Well, I'm glad somebody understands the true spirit of Christmas.",S03E21,245
Instead I'm going to do an impression of a family member.,S03E21,246
Oh.,S03E21,247
Can you guess who?,S03E21,248
My house is dirty. Ba-bam!,S03E21,249
I can't even hang a wreath. Ba-bam!,S03E21,250
- Whatnot. - Ba-bam!,S03E21,251
- Whatnot! - Ba-bam!,S03E21,252
"Oh, come on.",S03E21,253
You know what?  I've had it with the two of you.,S03E21,254
Forget it.,S03E21,255
Talent Show is canceled.,S03E21,256
- Who does he think he is?  - You gave birth to him.,S03E21,257
"Well, you married him. Ba-bam!",S03E21,258
"So last year, you tackled the Super Adventure Land Mayor.",S03E21,259
Today you bowled over Santa Claus. What's next?,S03E21,260
You gonna harpoon The Easter Bunny?,S03E21,261
"Well, I don't know.",S03E21,262
I haven't made my plans yet for easter.,S03E21,263
How much longer do I have to stay in here?,S03E21,264
You aren't going anywhere till we have a trial.,S03E21,265
Can't have a trial till the Judge gets here.,S03E21,266
"Well, when will that be?",S03E21,267
Super Adventure Land Christmas court is now in session.,S03E21,268
Santa?,S03E21,269
This is not how I wanted to be spending my break.,S03E21,270
"Teddy Duncan, you may approach the bench.",S03E21,271
Finally.,S03E21,272
"In the case of Kringle versus Duncan,",S03E21,273
you are charged with assault with a snowman head.,S03E21,274
How do you plead?,S03E21,275
Not guilty by reason of being,S03E21,276
Not guilty.,S03E21,277
"All right, Santa.",S03E21,278
"In your own words, tell us exactly what happened.",S03E21,279
"Well, I was taking my H.",S03E21,280
A.,S03E21,281
G.,S03E21,282
mandated break and then she attacked me.,S03E21,283
Ask him.,S03E21,284
He saw the whole thing.,S03E21,285
"Uh, your honor, I have to recuse myself.",S03E21,286
I'm in a very happy and committed relationship with the defendant.,S03E21,287
"Ooh, Sweetie.",S03E21,288
"Thank you, Sweetie, you are recused.",S03E21,289
"All right, let's hear from the defense.",S03E21,290
"Your honor, if I may, Christmas is the most magical time of year.",S03E21,291
And who loves it more than anyone?,S03E21,292
The children.,S03E21,293
And I was just trying to make one child happy.,S03E21,294
"So if that's a crime, well, then call me a criminal.",S03E21,295
Or don't.,S03E21,296
"You know, whatever gets me out of here faster.",S03E21,297
I've heard enough.,S03E21,298
I'm ready to rule.,S03E21,299
My verdict is guilty.,S03E21,300
Yes!,S03E21,301
You're guilty.,S03E21,302
Me? I'm I'm not on trial here.,S03E21,303
"I've never liked you, Carl.",S03E21,304
It's time you learned a little something about Christmas spirit.,S03E21,305
I sentence you to one picture with this little girl.,S03E21,306
"Thank you, Sheriff.",S03E21,307
Yay.,S03E21,308
"Jolly it up, Carl.",S03E21,309
What you doing? What are you looking at?,S03E21,310
What you doing?,S03E21,311
Oh.,S03E21,312
"Oh, he's such a sweet little angel.",S03E21,313
"Aw, he sure is.",S03E21,314
It's too bad his first Christmas has all this fighting and unpleasantness.,S03E21,315
I know.,S03E21,316
I have a solution.,S03E21,317
I'll help you pack.,S03E21,318
I was going to say that we should sing Deck The Halls together.,S03E21,319
You mean as a duet?,S03E21,320
Yes.,S03E21,321
"So, let's du-et.",S03E21,322
Yeah! Let's give it up for the great Bobbini and his assistant Charlie!,S03E21,323
"Okay, quick question for Bobbini.",S03E21,324
That dove you made disappear? Where is it?,S03E21,325
"Oh, don't worry, honey. We'll find it later",S03E21,326
Hopefully.,S03E21,327
"Okay, well, up next, the musical stylings of grandma and mom.",S03E21,328
Deck the halls with boughs of Holly.,S03E21,329
Fa la la la la la la la la la.,S03E21,330
'Tis the season to be jolly.,S03E21,331
Fa la la la la la la la la la.,S03E21,332
Don we now our gay apparel.,S03E21,333
Fa la la la la la la la la.,S03E21,334
Troll the ancient yuletide carol.,S03E21,335
Fa la la la la la la la la la.,S03E21,336
See the blazing yule before us.,S03E21,337
Fa la la la la la la la la la.,S03E21,338
- Strike the harp  - Ow!,S03E21,339
And join the chorus.,S03E21,340
Fa la la la la la la la la la.,S03E21,341
Follow me in merry measure.,S03E21,342
Fa la la la la la la la la la.,S03E21,343
While I tell of yuletide treasure.,S03E21,344
Fa la la la la la.,S03E21,345
La la la la!,S03E21,346
"Well, there you have it,",S03E21,347
grandma and mom working together for the first and,S03E21,348
probably the last time.,S03E21,349
"Okay, next we have PJ and Gabe doing what are you guys doing?",S03E21,350
An exercise in improvisational theater.,S03E21,351
That's right.,S03E21,352
"Improv at its finest, people.",S03E21,353
We are looking for suggestions from the audience.,S03E21,354
We need an occupation and an object.,S03E21,355
- A lawyer and a rock.,S03E21,356
- Has to be a cop and a banana.,S03E21,357
- A cop and a banana.,S03E21,358
- Excellent suggestion.,S03E21,359
"Oh, here I am being a cop.",S03E21,360
"Ooh, look at that.",S03E21,361
A banana.,S03E21,362
Now I'm peeling the banana.,S03E21,363
"Hey, I'm a criminal.",S03E21,364
Give me that banana.,S03E21,365
"No, it's my banana.",S03E21,366
And scene.,S03E21,367
"Okay, now Spencer and I are going to sing a new Christmas song for you.",S03E21,368
Hope you like it.,S03E21,369
I hear church bells a'ringing.,S03E21,370
Carolers are singing.,S03E21,371
Harmony with me now.,S03E21,372
You are looking so lovely.,S03E21,373
Yeah!,S03E21,374
Even if the lights go out.,S03E21,375
"We've got mistletoe, and firelight.",S03E21,376
On this cold December night.,S03E21,377
The snow outside will set the mood.,S03E21,378
As I sing my song for you.,S03E21,379
Woo!,S03E21,380
"Merry first Christmas, Toby.",S03E21,381
Yay.,S03E21,382
For Gabe.,S03E21,383
Okay.,S03E21,384
"Merry Christmas, Gabe.",S03E21,385
"Hey, headphones! Thanks, guys.",S03E21,386
How do you know what's in it? You haven't opened it yet.,S03E21,387
"Oh, right.",S03E21,388
"Hey, headphones.",S03E21,389
"Thanks, guys.",S03E21,390
"Okay, where are mom's presents?",S03E21,391
"Expensive one's under the red tree, cheap one's behind my chair.",S03E21,392
"Okay, honey, time for you and I to exchange presents.",S03E21,393
But I want mine first.,S03E21,394
"Well, hang on there, tiger.",S03E21,395
Easy easy.,S03E21,396
"Okay, let's see what we've got here.",S03E21,397
"Oh, my goodness!",S03E21,398
Whoa.,S03E21,399
"Big box, small present.",S03E21,400
Mama Ames's Christmas fake-out. Woo woo!,S03E21,401
What is it?,S03E21,402
I bought you your very own star.,S03E21,403
Nice! Ooh!,S03E21,404
It's recorded in the International Star Registry and everything.,S03E21,405
I almost bought him a planet.,S03E21,406
That could have been ugly.,S03E21,407
Wow.,S03E21,408
"Thank you, Sweetie.",S03E21,409
"Hey, mom, check it out.",S03E21,410
Eh.,S03E21,411
"Okay, where's my present?",S03E21,412
"Uh, hang on. Still still loving my present,",S03E21,413
"which must have cost you a pretty penny, yes?",S03E21,414
"Dad, it's the thought that counts.",S03E21,415
Can't put a price on that.,S03E21,416
Yes.,S03E21,417
But if you could,S03E21,418
Still waiting for my present.,S03E21,419
"Okay, um",S03E21,420
Uh,S03E21,421
"Okay, all right.",S03E21,422
- There we go.  - Ooh! What do we have here?,S03E21,423
Oh.,S03E21,424
It's a bracelet.,S03E21,425
"Oh, Bob, it's beautiful.",S03E21,426
But you must have spent 10 times what I spent.,S03E21,427
"Oh, now we're gonna talk prices.",S03E21,428
"Well, honey, I just",S03E21,429
"I'm very thankful, I just",S03E21,430
I thought we agreed not to spend very much.,S03E21,431
Maybe you'll find our gift a little more appropriate.,S03E21,432
"Hey, what are you you can't",S03E21,433
"- This is from me and PJ! - Oh, my goodness! A foot cush?",S03E21,434
Yeah.,S03E21,435
How did you guys know?,S03E21,436
"Seriously, you guys! I have been wanting one of these forever.",S03E21,437
"Oh, my gosh. I mentioned it to your father once,",S03E21,438
but I guess he wasn't listening.,S03E21,439
"We listen, mom.",S03E21,440
Because we care.,S03E21,441
"Okay, time for our Christmas picture.",S03E21,442
Okay.,S03E21,443
"Let's do it, guys.",S03E21,444

Ah!,S03E21,452
"Hey, Charlie.",S03E21,453
"Well, you finally got your first picture with Santa Claus.",S03E21,454
It was a day to remember.,S03E21,455
"Although I hope you forget the part about me attacking Santa clause,",S03E21,456
and then going to jail.,S03E21,457
Maybe I shouldn't have mentioned that.,S03E21,458
"Hey, Charlie.",S03E21,459
"So, you finally got your first picture with Santa Claus.",S03E21,460
That I'm mentioning for the very first time.,S03E21,461
"Hey, any chance I could say good luck, Charlie?",S03E21,462
- I've never said it before.,S03E21,463
"- Oh, yeah.",S03E21,464
"Sure, of course.",S03E21,465
"- Good luck, Charlie.  - Hey!",S03E21,466
Ba-bam!,S03E21,467

"Snowy the Snowman, registered trademark",S03E21,471
"of Super Adventure Land, incorporated?",S03E21,472
What are you doing here?,S03E21,473
My head's fine.,S03E21,474
Thanks for asking.,S03E21,475
"Oh, are you mad because I used your head as a bowling ball?",S03E21,476
Little bit.,S03E21,477
"Look, I'm I'm really sorry.",S03E21,478
Come on in.,S03E21,479
"Hey, how about I make it up to you? How about some cookies?",S03E21,480

Great.,S03E21,482
"All right, well, make yourself comfortable.",S03E21,483
I'll be right back.,S03E21,484
"Okay, so great news, we've got chocolate chip, peanut butter",S03E21,485
Yeee!,S03E21,486
Oh!,S03E21,487
"Snowy, no!",S03E21,488
I'm having a bad day.,S03E21,489
"Well, Charlie, here we are in our hotel room, and we're not on vacation.",S03E22,0
"Confused? Well, get comfortable, because it's a doozy.",S03E22,1
"Charlie, get out of the bathroom!",S03E22,2
In a minute!,S03E22,3
Hey.,S03E22,4
"Come on, guys.",S03E22,5
Huh?.,S03E22,6
Not so bad.,S03E22,7
Kind of an adventure.,S03E22,8
"- Oh, save it.",S03E22,9
- Be quiet! Shut up.,S03E22,10
Come on.,S03E22,11
I'm just trying to make the best of it.,S03E22,12
- Because you caused it.,S03E22,13
- Not totally my fault.,S03E22,14
- Then whose fault was it? - I'll get back to you on that.,S03E22,15
Ugh.,S03E22,16
"Teddy, I need a hand.",S03E22,17
So how we got here is kind of a long story.,S03E22,18
Let's just say this is the worst day in Duncan family history.,S03E22,19
"- Teddy, now! - I'm coming!",S03E22,20
To be continued.,S03E22,21
"Oh. You hear that, Toby?",S03E22,22
It's called quiet.,S03E22,23
"Enjoy it while you can, because in this house it doesn't last long.",S03E22,24
- Mom! - Hmm? Told you.,S03E22,25
Why is Toby's crib in my room?,S03E22,26
Because you two are sharing a room now.,S03E22,27
- We talked about this.,S03E22,28
"- No, we didn't.",S03E22,29
"We didn't? Oh, well, Toby and I talked, and he's fine with it.",S03E22,30
I I can't share a room with a baby.,S03E22,31
I'm a teenager now.,S03E22,32
I need my own space.,S03E22,33
"Well, I'm sorry, honey, but we only have so many rooms.",S03E22,34
"Besides, you love Toby.",S03E22,35
This isn't about love.,S03E22,36
This is about square footage.,S03E22,37
"Well, if it makes it any easier,",S03E22,38
Toby's about the same age you were when you moved in with P.,S03E22,39
J.,S03E22,40
"Yeah, but with me and P.",S03E22,41
J.,S03E22,42
", the little brother was in charge.",S03E22,43
That ain't happening with us.,S03E22,44
Oh aren't you adorable?,S03E22,45
"Stop that, Gabe! Stay strong.",S03E22,46
Today's all burnt toast ,S03E22,47
"Running late, and dad jokes",S03E22,48
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S03E22,49
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S03E22,50
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S03E22,51
There it is up on the roof,S03E22,52
"I've been there, I've survived",S03E22,53
So just take my advice,S03E22,54
"Hang in there, baby",S03E22,55
Things are crazy,S03E22,56
But I know your future's bright,S03E22,57
"Hang in there, baby",S03E22,58
There's no maybe,S03E22,59
Everything turns out all right,S03E22,60
Sure life is up and down,S03E22,61
But trust me it comes back around,S03E22,62
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S03E22,63
"Hang in there, baby.",S03E22,64
"Oh, hey, P.",S03E22,65
J.,S03E22,66
you are a good cook.,S03E22,67
Could you taste this and tell me what you think?,S03E22,68
Sure.,S03E22,69
Um,S03E22,70
What is it?,S03E22,71
"Well, that's not a good question.",S03E22,72
It's New England clam chowder.,S03E22,73
"Ah. Well, I'm not getting any chowder",S03E22,74
Or clams.,S03E22,75
Or even England.,S03E22,76
"It is new, though.",S03E22,77
Oh man!,S03E22,78
I wanted to make Spencer a special welcome-home lunch.,S03E22,79
He was visiting BIPA.,S03E22,80
"BIPA, the Boston Institute of Performing Arts.",S03E22,81
He's hoping to go there next Fall.,S03E22,82
"There he is. Hey, um, do you think you could rescue this?",S03E22,83
- No problem.,S03E22,84
- Thank you.,S03E22,85
Step one.,S03E22,86
Oh! I'm so glad you're home.,S03E22,87
- So how was BIPA? - Supa.,S03E22,88
It's how they say super in Boston.,S03E22,89

Mine's better.,S03E22,94
"So hey, how was it?",S03E22,95
"Oh my gosh, the school is amazing.",S03E22,96
"- I mean, I loved it.",S03E22,97
- That's awesome.,S03E22,98
So when do you find out if you got in?,S03E22,99
I already found out.,S03E22,100
They accepted me.,S03E22,101
"Way to go, boyfriend!",S03E22,102
"Oh yeah, uh-huh.",S03E22,103
Why am I the only one doing a happy dance?,S03E22,104
"Well, because because there's one other thing.",S03E22,105
"Um, they want me to start a little early.",S03E22,106
"Well, like how early?",S03E22,107
Monday.,S03E22,108
"- What?  - Yeah, it's called early enrollment.",S03E22,109
"They have a space available and if I want it, I have to take it right now.",S03E22,110
But you haven't finished high school.,S03E22,111
"Yeah, I know, but I already have enough credits to graduate.",S03E22,112
Wow.,S03E22,113
This is,S03E22,114
Wow.,S03E22,115
"Hey, Teddy",S03E22,116
I haven't made my decision yet.,S03E22,117
"I mean, I wanted to talk to you first.",S03E22,118
What do you think?,S03E22,119
I don't know.,S03E22,120
I'm just kind of in shock.,S03E22,121
"Yeah, me too.",S03E22,122
Who's ready for some delicious New England chicken noodle chowder?,S03E22,123
Denver Omelet?,S03E22,124
"Guys, guys, I had an unbelievable day at work.",S03E22,125
Wait until I tell you what happened.,S03E22,126
"Oh, I think I hear Toby.",S03E22,127
Baby's right there.,S03E22,128
"- Oh, then I think I hear Charlie.",S03E22,129
- Charlie's at a play date.,S03E22,130
"I'm trying to get out of a bug story, work with me here.",S03E22,131
Okay. So I'm doing a routine spray job over at the Andersons',S03E22,132
"They have a monthly maintenance package,",S03E22,133
so that means I go every other Tuesday.,S03E22,134
"So the first Tuesday is perimeter, the second Tuesday's interior.",S03E22,135
- I think I hear the doorbell.,S03E22,136
"- Oh no, you don't.",S03E22,137
"Anyway, long story short",S03E22,138
- I captured these bad boys.,S03E22,139
- Ugh.,S03E22,140
Huh?,S03E22,141
Brazilian termites.,S03E22,142
"Very rare, very destructive and they've never been found in North America",S03E22,143
Until now.,S03E22,144
"Well, if they're so destructive, why would you bring them into our house?",S03E22,145
Our wooden house?,S03E22,146
"Honey, I'm not an idiot.",S03E22,147
This container termite-proof.,S03E22,148
- Are you sure? - I am sure.,S03E22,149
"Besides, it's only gonna be for one night.",S03E22,150
Tomorrow I'm taking em to the University of Denver.,S03E22,151
This could land me in the exterminator hall of fame.,S03E22,152
"Bob honey, that doesn't exist.",S03E22,153
"Honey, yes, it does.",S03E22,154
It's in Detroit.,S03E22,155
"Used to be in Cleveland, but they had to move it.",S03E22,156
Rat problem.,S03E22,157
"So I know that it's a great opportunity,",S03E22,158
"but if Spencer leaves now, I'm gonna be so sad.",S03E22,159
We have so many plans for the rest of the year.,S03E22,160
"When I get a boyfriend, we're gonna make bunch of plans too.",S03E22,161
Maybe you should make a plan to get a boyfriend.,S03E22,162
Maybe you should make a plan not to tell me to make a plan.,S03E22,163
"Volleyball friends, huh?",S03E22,164
"Well, one problem at a time.",S03E22,165
So Spencer asked me what I thought he should do,S03E22,166
And I don't know what to tell him.,S03E22,167
"I think if you're lucky enough to get a boyfriend,",S03E22,168
you should never ever let him go,S03E22,169
Even if you have to lock him in the basement and not tell anybody.,S03E22,170
So,S03E22,171
"Of course I don't want Spencer to go,",S03E22,172
but I also don't want to be the one to keep him from going.,S03E22,173
"Oh man. I wish I had some experience with these things,",S03E22,174
but for some reason boys find me weird and off-putting.,S03E22,175
"Not just boys, sweetie.",S03E22,176
"Kelsey, what do you think?",S03E22,177
I think whatever happens is gonna be great.,S03E22,178
"But if Spencer goes, then Teddy will be crushed.",S03E22,179
"- You make a good point. - And if he doesn't go,",S03E22,180
- he might be miserable.,S03E22,181
"- That's a good point, too.",S03E22,182
So what are you saying?,S03E22,183
That I agree with everybody.,S03E22,184
But you can't agree with everybody.,S03E22,185
You are absolutely right.,S03E22,186
You just did it again!,S03E22,187
"Okay, I've made my decision.",S03E22,188
- What is it? - I need some new friends.,S03E22,189
My little Deedee just loves playing with your little Charlie.,S03E22,190
Oh.,S03E22,191
"Although, last time she asked me, why does Charlie have a boy's name?",S03E22,192
And I didn't know what to tell her.,S03E22,193
"Hey, honey. How's your play date going?",S03E22,194
- Eh.,S03E22,195
- Mmm.,S03E22,196
Follow up question: Where's Deedee?,S03E22,197
In jail.,S03E22,198
Final question: What does jail mean exactly?,S03E22,199
"Uh, well, it means, we'd better go check.",S03E22,200
"Oh, my.",S03E22,201
Oh.,S03E22,202
"Oh, Deedee.",S03E22,203
- Not funny.,S03E22,204
"- Oh, sorry.",S03E22,205
- Oh.,S03E22,206
"- Yeah, you guys go play.",S03E22,207
Maybe we should just stay in here with the girls for a while.,S03E22,208
- Sounds like a good idea.,S03E22,209
"- Okay, sure.",S03E22,210
"Well, at least this will make a good post for my blog.",S03E22,211
"Uh, you have a blog?",S03E22,212
I call it Mama Debbie's Daily Doing's.,S03E22,213
"Oh, you're serious.",S03E22,214
You betcha.,S03E22,215
"I post recipes, offer helpful hints",S03E22,216
Share fun things Doug Dooley and I do together.,S03E22,217
Just passing along some of the things I've learned about motherhood and such.,S03E22,218
"Wow, and you've based this on your vast experience with one child?",S03E22,219
And one on the way for a total of two.,S03E22,220
Oh.,S03E22,221
I have a total of five.,S03E22,222
It's not a competition.,S03E22,223
It wasn't.,S03E22,224
- What are you doing down here? - Toby kept me up all night.,S03E22,225
Ah.,S03E22,226
It's called payback.,S03E22,227
"When you were a baby, you used to make my life miserable, too.",S03E22,228
I will never forget the night I woke up in your crib and you were in my bed.,S03E22,229
I still have no idea how you did that.,S03E22,230
"Well, me and Toby sharing a room is not gonna work.",S03E22,231
Something has to be done now.,S03E22,232
Oh! Are you gonna do something bad?,S03E22,233
Because that'd be great,S03E22,234
- For me. - What are you talking about?,S03E22,235
"Well, I have to break some difficult news to mom and dad,",S03E22,236
and they're not gonna be happy.,S03E22,237
"So I was thinking maybe if you got in trouble,",S03E22,238
I could sneak my news in and kind of piggyback on your badness.,S03E22,239
"Well, what's the news?",S03E22,240
"Oh, it's nothing.",S03E22,241
"You know, I'd get it out of you, but I am way too tired.",S03E22,242
So what do you think?,S03E22,243
You gonna be getting into trouble anytime soon?,S03E22,244
I don't know.,S03E22,245
It's different.,S03E22,246
I'm a teenager now.,S03E22,247
"Well, what kind of attitude is that?",S03E22,248
That is quitter talk.,S03E22,249
Brazilian termites.,S03E22,250
This is the most exciting thing,S03E22,251
since I discovered those Ukrainian grub worms in 06.,S03E22,252
"Excuse me, I discovered those.",S03E22,253
"No, I was in the crawl space.",S03E22,254
You were in the port-a-john.,S03E22,255
Fine.,S03E22,256
Here.,S03E22,257
Feast your eyes on those little beauties.,S03E22,258
I don't see em.,S03E22,259
"- Well, they're in there. - Are you sure?",S03E22,260
All I see are two little holes.,S03E22,261
Holes?!,S03E22,262
Oh no.,S03E22,263
No no no! They ate right through the plastic!,S03E22,264
"Oh, this is bad.",S03E22,265
This is really bad.,S03E22,266
"Okay, look, we gotta wipe em out before they multiply",S03E22,267
"More importantly, before Amy finds out.",S03E22,268
"Well, we could tent the place.",S03E22,269
"Hey, there you go.",S03E22,270
She'll never notice a giant gas-filled tarp covering the house.,S03E22,271
"Well, then what are we gonna do?",S03E22,272
I've got an idea.,S03E22,273
To the bug mobile!,S03E22,274
I love when he does that.,S03E22,275
"Hey, sweetie, can you go get me the jail? Mommy needs to do laundry.",S03E22,276
- Okay.,S03E22,277
"- Thank you, sweetie.",S03E22,278
"Hi, Charlie.",S03E22,279
"Hey, mom.",S03E22,280
"- Hey, sweetie. - What you doing?",S03E22,281
Working on my mommy blog.,S03E22,282
Mommy blog? That doesn't sound like you.,S03E22,283
I am gonna kick Debbie Dooley's butt.,S03E22,284
That sounds like you.,S03E22,285
The only problem is I'm having trouble coming up with topics.,S03E22,286
What kind of stuff does Debbie post about?,S03E22,287
"- Recipes - Ooh, so that's out.",S03E22,288
"She also writes about fun stuff she does with her husband, so that's out too.",S03E22,289
"Hey, where is Gabe? He's always up to something?",S03E22,290
"Well, here's hoping.",S03E22,291
I mean for you and your blog.,S03E22,292
Not for me.,S03E22,293
Why would I need him to do anything bad?,S03E22,294
Coming!,S03E22,295
- Hey.,S03E22,296
- Hi.,S03E22,297
"- So listen, I - So, Teddy, I",S03E22,298
"- You first. - Okay, um",S03E22,299
I'm just gonna come out and say it.,S03E22,300
I think you should go to Boston.,S03E22,301
Because I was kinda leaning towards not going.,S03E22,302
- Why? - I just don't think I can leave you.,S03E22,303
"Oh, Spence, but BIPA is your dream school.",S03E22,304
It's the best musicprogram in the country,S03E22,305
"and you know if you don't grab this opportunity,",S03E22,306
you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.,S03E22,307
"Yeah, but it's not the only college out there.",S03E22,308
"I mean, I could stay here and audition for",S03E22,309
the Denver Institute of Performing Arts.,S03E22,310
- DIPA? - Yeah.,S03E22,311
DIPA's not as good as BIPA.,S03E22,312
Oh yeah? You know who went to DIPA?,S03E22,313
- Kelly Ripa. - Ripa went to DIPA?,S03E22,314
"No, I just wanted to hear you say that.",S03E22,315
"Hey, you know you have to do this.",S03E22,316
"Yeah, but what about us?",S03E22,317
"Well, there will still be an us, just a long-distance us.",S03E22,318
"- You really think we can make that work? - Hey, nothing is far away anymore.",S03E22,319
We can we can text.,S03E22,320
We can talk on the phone.,S03E22,321
We can video chat.,S03E22,322
We can email.,S03E22,323
"Oh, and the great part is that when I smell funny",S03E22,324
You won't have a clue.,S03E22,325
"- Hey, you never smell funny.",S03E22,326
- I know.,S03E22,327
"It's gonna be okay, sweetie.",S03E22,328
We can do this.,S03E22,329
"Yeah, of course we can.",S03E22,330
So when do you have to leave?,S03E22,331
Tomorrow.,S03E22,332
Okay.,S03E22,333
Then come here.,S03E22,334
"Until tomorrow, I'm not gonna let you go.",S03E22,335
Me neither.,S03E22,336
"Hey, it's kinda cold out here. You wanna go inside?",S03E22,337
Sure.,S03E22,338
"Okay, my hungry little ants",S03E22,339
Today's special is Brazilian.,S03E22,340

"Uh, because",S03E22,346
I'm training.,S03E22,347
"Uh, I'm uh, letting the ants go now so I can catch em again later.",S03E22,348
All the exterminators do it.,S03E22,349
"Dad, do you think it's fair to say I'm not the brightest Duncan?",S03E22,350
"It it's more than fair, son.",S03E22,351
"So if I'm not buying this story, who do you think will?",S03E22,352
"All right, look, um",S03E22,353
Those Brazilian termites that I brought home?,S03E22,354
"They got out, so I brought in some ants,",S03E22,355
because the ants will eat the termites.,S03E22,356
See? So it's gonna be fine.,S03E22,357
Everything's gonna be fine.,S03E22,358
Why don't you just tent the house?,S03E22,359
Because I don't want your mom to find out.,S03E22,360
"Because if mom found out, that'd be bad.",S03E22,361
That would be very bad.,S03E22,362
But she's not gonna find out.,S03E22,363
"Right, right.",S03E22,364
"Uh, but when she does, could you let me know?",S03E22,365
- Why? - Just because.,S03E22,366
It's not like I have something to hide.,S03E22,367
Coming!,S03E22,368

"No, it's not.",S03E22,371
Then what's my bed doing here?,S03E22,372
"Gabe, you are not taking over the living room.",S03E22,373
It's not the living room.,S03E22,374
It's the fireplace area.,S03E22,375
"Oh yeah, that makes me feel better",S03E22,376
Gabe With fire in his room.,S03E22,377
Now pack it up!,S03E22,378
That's what I get for answering the curtain.,S03E22,379
It's so good to see your face.,S03E22,380
"I know it's only been a few days, but I miss you so much.",S03E22,381
I miss you too.,S03E22,382
And I'm sorry we haven't been able to talk very much it's just,S03E22,383

"Hey, how about that?",S03E22,394
You see the butt scratch?,S03E22,395
"Yes, Sir.",S03E22,396

"Oh no, I completely understand. It's just",S03E22,398
"Well, after the scratch you picked up an apple.",S03E22,399
Then you put it back.,S03E22,400
"Well, yeah, I just",S03E22,401
I realized I was in the mood for cereal.,S03E22,402
Not really the point.,S03E22,403
"- Okay, I'm back.",S03E22,404
- See you.,S03E22,405
"Finally, we're all alone.",S03E22,406

"Um, I'm gonna need to call you back.",S03E22,416

I call them Debbie Dooley's dos and don'ts.,S03E22,437
Do use spell-check.,S03E22,438
Don't not use spell-check.,S03E22,439
Do know that my blog will always be more popular than yours.,S03E22,440
Don't think it won't.,S03E22,441
Okay.,S03E22,442

Yeah.,S03E22,446
Do go back to where you came from.,S03E22,447
Don't bother me again.,S03E22,448
So how's the long-distance relationship going?,S03E22,449
"Not good. You know, we both have such different schedules,",S03E22,450
we barely had any time to talk.,S03E22,451
Told you you should've locked him in the basement.,S03E22,452
"I know it's only been three days, but I miss him so much.",S03E22,453
I just wish I could see him.,S03E22,454
So why don't you?,S03E22,455
Fly all the way to Boston by myself?,S03E22,456
My mom and dad would never let me do that.,S03E22,457
Unless they didn't know about it.,S03E22,458
You could just tell them that you're spending the weekend at my house.,S03E22,459
That's good.,S03E22,460
I like that.,S03E22,461
"So this weekend, we'll be at",S03E22,462

"Last night because she was afraid of the dark,",S03E22,498
she set off a bunch of fireworks.,S03E22,499
"Boy, did that cause a ruckus.",S03E22,500
A very interesting woman.,S03E22,501
What happened?,S03E22,502
Did mom and dad kick you out because you did something horrible?,S03E22,503
Please say yes.,S03E22,504
"Dude, I didn't do anything.",S03E22,505
This is my new room.,S03E22,506
"Gabe, you can't live on the porch.",S03E22,507
"- Why not? - Well, for one thing, there's no light.",S03E22,508
Porch light.,S03E22,509
There's no running water.,S03E22,510
Hose.,S03E22,511
What about a bathroom?,S03E22,512
Hello.,S03E22,513

Been so busy with your new room,S03E22,515
you forgot to get in trouble for your big brother.,S03E22,516
What are you so afraid to tell mom and dad?,S03E22,517
Can't say.,S03E22,518
It's bad.,S03E22,519
"Oh, come on, it can't be that bad.",S03E22,520
Just tell me what it is.,S03E22,521
"Okay, but you have to promise not to tell anybody.",S03E22,522
I promise.,S03E22,523
All right.,S03E22,524
Here goes.,S03E22,525
I dropped out of college.,S03E22,526
What?!,S03E22,527
"Oh man, mom and dad are gonna kill you!",S03E22,528
You just said it wasn't even that bad.,S03E22,529
I didn't know what it was!,S03E22,530
Wait. Why'd you quit college?,S03E22,531
Because it's just it's just not for me.,S03E22,532
And there's something else I wanna do.,S03E22,533
"Well, you'd better do it quick,",S03E22,534
because mom and dad are gonna kill you!,S03E22,535
You said that already!,S03E22,536
"Well, when are you gonna tell em?",S03E22,537
I don't know.,S03E22,538
"Soon, probably.",S03E22,539
There's a chance dad might be in some hot water with mom.,S03E22,540
I'm gonna wait and see how that plays out.,S03E22,541
"Hey, can I use your bathroom?",S03E22,542
"- Yeah, sure, go ahead.",S03E22,543
- Cool.,S03E22,544
"- Oh, hey, hon.",S03E22,545
"- Hey, sweetie.",S03E22,546
"Look, babe, there's sandwich fixins over there if you're interested.",S03E22,547
That sounds,S03E22,548
Guh,S03E22,549
Guh? What does that mean?,S03E22,550
Nothing.,S03E22,551
What are you doing?,S03E22,552
Just stretching.,S03E22,553
Before you eat?,S03E22,554
It's pretty important.,S03E22,555
So what's bringing you to Boston?,S03E22,556
"Well, hopefully this plane.",S03E22,557
"No, actually, I'm gonna go visit my boyfriend.",S03E22,558
We're in a long-distance relationship.,S03E22,559
Ah.,S03E22,560
"Well, you're sitting next to the right guy.",S03E22,561
I travel for a living and I've got tons of tips.,S03E22,562
"First off, don't travel for a living.",S03E22,563
"Seriously now, you're always gonna have to have one of these things handy.",S03E22,564
"Well, it looks very comfortable.",S03E22,565
I always carry a spare.,S03E22,566
Thanks.,S03E22,567
Hungry?,S03E22,568
"Uh, I guess. What do you got?",S03E22,569
Waldorf salad.,S03E22,570
"Well, if that's all you got.",S03E22,571
Fresh ground pepper?,S03E22,572
Don't mind if I do.,S03E22,573
"By the way, I'm Herb Pickier.",S03E22,574
"Oh, Teddy Duncan.",S03E22,575
Nice to meet you.,S03E22,576
"Tell me, Teddy, do you have any need for high-pressure gas flanges?",S03E22,577
"Um, not at the moment.",S03E22,578
Oh.,S03E22,579
"Well, take my card, anyway.",S03E22,580
You never know.,S03E22,581
"I pretty much know, but thank you.",S03E22,582
So how long you gonna be in Boston?,S03E22,583
"Oh, just for the weekend.",S03E22,584
I'm gonna surprise my boyfriend.,S03E22,585
I can't wait to see the look on his face.,S03E22,586
I'm going to Denver to surprise my girlfriend.,S03E22,587
I can't wait to see the look on her face.,S03E22,588
It's open.,S03E22,589
Surprise!,S03E22,590
This is crazy.,S03E22,591
But I don't know who you are.,S03E22,592
"Ahem, um, is Spencer here?",S03E22,593
He's in Denver.,S03E22,594
He went to surprise his girlfriend.,S03E22,595
I'm his girlfriend.,S03E22,596
I came here to surprise him.,S03E22,597
"Well, that was exciting for a second.",S03E22,598
Teddy.,S03E22,599
You're never gonna guess where I am.,S03E22,600
- Denver? - Huh.,S03E22,601
I thought that would be harder.,S03E22,602
"Yeah, well, guess where I am.",S03E22,603
- Boston! - What?,S03E22,604
"Well, I guess we both had the same idea. Surprise!",S03E22,605
"Oh gosh, this is terrible.",S03E22,606
We're not gonna be able to see each other.,S03E22,607
"Yes, we are.",S03E22,608
"Okay, you stay right there.",S03E22,609
I'll just take the first flight back.,S03E22,610
"Well, I mean I'm already at your front door.",S03E22,611
I might as well say hi to your parents.,S03E22,612
"Don't. No no, what are you doing?",S03E22,613
They don't know that I'm out here.,S03E22,614
"- Well, I just rang the bell. - Just move!",S03E22,615
"Son, that is what we call ding-dong ditch.",S03E22,616
"Hey, Charlie, wanna play a game?",S03E22,617
"Okay, so I'm thinking of a number,",S03E22,618
"and if you guess it, you get to have Toby move into your room.",S03E22,619
Nice try.,S03E22,620
Hey P.,S03E22,621
J.,S03E22,622
", you wanna play a game?.",S03E22,623
"Still trying to find a bedroom, huh?",S03E22,624
"Yeah, and I've tried everywhere",S03E22,625
"The living room, the basement, the front porch.",S03E22,626
I assume you've ruled out the attic. Ugh!,S03E22,627
- The what? - The attic. Ugh!,S03E22,628
We have an attic?,S03E22,629
Yeah.,S03E22,630
It's upstairs.,S03E22,631
"Yeah yeah, that'd be the place for it.",S03E22,632
Wait. Why didn't I know we had an attic?,S03E22,633
You didn't know we had a tree house either.,S03E22,634
You gotta start looking up.,S03E22,635
See? Ugh!,S03E22,636
It's not ugh! It'sHey!,S03E22,637
- Teddy! - Herb.,S03E22,638
Hi.,S03E22,639
"Hey, how was your day in Boston?",S03E22,640
Not so good.,S03E22,641
Pillow me.,S03E22,642
Thanks. So,S03E22,643
My boyfriend decided to surprise me and flew out to Denver.,S03E22,644
"Oh, the old double surprise gone bad.",S03E22,645
I could sing a few bars of that one.,S03E22,646
"But you're not going to, right?",S03E22,647
"No no, they frown upon that during the safety announcement.",S03E22,648
"It's just that by the time I get back,",S03E22,649
Spencer I will barely have any time together.,S03E22,650
All long-distance relationships are brutal.,S03E22,651
You try to make em work.,S03E22,652
"You email, you text, you video chat",S03E22,653
Then one night you decide,S03E22,654
you'd rather watch a Battlestar Galactica Marathon,S03E22,655
and suddenly you're the bad guy.,S03E22,656
I'm pretty sure that won't happen to me.,S03E22,657
Stay away from the first season.,S03E22,658
It's addictive.,S03E22,659
Good to know.,S03E22,660
All I'm trying to say is there's no substitute,S03E22,661
"for being in the same place together,",S03E22,662
and anyone who thinks otherwise is just kidding themselves.,S03E22,663
"Oh, except for you and your boyfriend.",S03E22,664
You kids'll be fine.,S03E22,665
This is the Captain speaking. Just wanna let you know,S03E22,666
"that there's some weather over the Ohio valley,",S03E22,667
so we're gonna be a little delayed tonight,S03E22,668
"Three, four hours tops.",S03E22,669
"Wha well, here's a thought:",S03E22,670
Fly around Ohio.,S03E22,671
"Well, looks like we're gonna be here for a while.",S03E22,672
Mini quiche?,S03E22,673
"- Hey, mom.",S03E22,674
"- Hey, P.",S03E22,675
J.,S03E22,676
"Okay, she's sitting right there. Just",S03E22,677
Get it over with and tell her you dropped out of college.,S03E22,678
"If you hold it in one more second, you'll go",S03E22,679
"Ooh, grapes!",S03E22,680
When did we get those?,S03E22,681
Mom must've gone to the store.,S03E22,682
But she doesn't always wash them.,S03E22,683
Did I just eat an unwashed grape?,S03E22,684
What am I doing in the kitchen?,S03E22,685
"Oh, right.",S03E22,686
Mom?,S03E22,687
There's something I gotta tell ya.,S03E22,688
Hello.,S03E22,689
"Yeah, hold on.",S03E22,690
"Uh, somebody from Good Morning, Denver wants to talk to you.",S03E22,691
"Good Morning, Denver? The TV show?",S03E22,692
Yeah.,S03E22,693
I think I have a minute.,S03E22,694
Hello.,S03E22,695
This is she.,S03E22,696
Uh-huh.,S03E22,697
Uh-huh.,S03E22,698
I I think I could arrange something.,S03E22,699
"Oh, very good.",S03E22,700
"Yes, thank you for calling.",S03E22,701
What's going on?,S03E22,702
I'm gonna be on TV!,S03E22,703
"Wow, that's great, mom.",S03E22,704
They loved my mommy blog and they want me to do a segment on the show!,S03E22,705
"And if it all goes well, be a regular.",S03E22,706
"- They said that? - No, but they will!",S03E22,707
After I'm on TV.,S03E22,708
"Well, I think that's all the ant traps.",S03E22,709
"Okay. Well, by now the ants have done their job",S03E22,710
- and the termites are gone.,S03E22,711
- Sure hope so.,S03E22,712
"Come on, 2,000 ants against two termites?",S03E22,713
I think I likes me my odds.,S03E22,714
"Oh no, I it's termites!",S03E22,715
Dozens of em!,S03E22,716
How did they multiply so fast?,S03E22,717
"Well, they are in the Duncan house.",S03E22,718
Kind of a when in Rome situation?,S03E22,719
Ah.,S03E22,720
We're gonna have to tent the house.,S03E22,721
What am I gonna tell Amy?,S03E22,722
You could tell her the truth.,S03E22,723
Or,S03E22,724
- A vacation? - Yes.,S03E22,725
"Honey, you work so hard,",S03E22,726
you do so much around here you deserve a vacation.,S03E22,727
"Well, okay.",S03E22,728
That sounds great.,S03E22,729
When were you thinking?.,S03E22,730
8:00 A.,S03E22,731
M.,S03E22,732
Tuesday to 8:00 A.,S03E22,733
M.,S03E22,734
Thursday.,S03E22,735
48 hours of fun!,S03E22,736
"Just you, me, the kids and the perishables.",S03E22,737
"Bob, Bob, I can't do that.",S03E22,738
"I'm gonna be on TV Tuesday morning, remember?",S03E22,739
"Oh, right. Um",S03E22,740
"Okay, no problem.",S03E22,741
We'll leave right after you're done.,S03E22,742
"Okay, sounds great.",S03E22,743
"Hey, why are we taking the perishables?",S03E22,744
Because,S03E22,745
We,S03E22,746
Coming!,S03E22,747
- Finally.,S03E22,748
- Oh there's my girl.,S03E22,749
"Hey, what time did you get in last night?",S03E22,750
4:00 A.,S03E22,751
M.,S03E22,752
I am so sorry.,S03E22,753
"The plane got delayed, quiches went cold,",S03E22,754
Herb only brought one side salad,S03E22,755
It was a complete disaster.,S03E22,756
Herb?,S03E22,757
"Yeah, you'll probably meet him on the flight back.",S03E22,758
But the important thing is that we're together now.,S03E22,759
"Well, for an hour.",S03E22,760
What?,S03E22,761
"Yeah, I have to catch a plane.",S03E22,762
I've got class tomorrow.,S03E22,763
"Well, great. So I have to wait until spring break to see you again?",S03E22,764
Oh.,S03E22,765
Gosh.,S03E22,766
My parents are coming to Boston for spring break.,S03E22,767
So we have one hour together in five months?,S03E22,768
"Well, we can find a couple ofweekends to visit each other.",S03E22,769
"No, Spence, I can't.",S03E22,770
"My parents don't even know that I took this trip,",S03E22,771
I can't lie to them again.,S03E22,772
"Well, what are we gonna do?",S03E22,773
I don't know.,S03E22,774
I didn't know it was gonna be this hard.,S03E22,775
"Yeah, me neither.",S03E22,776
I just can't spend all my time missing you.,S03E22,777
I'm gonna drive myself crazy.,S03E22,778
"Yeah, I feel the same way.",S03E22,779
What do we do?,S03E22,780
"Well, I mean, there's nothing we can do, except",S03E22,781
I don't wanna say it.,S03E22,782
"Yeah, I don't wanna say it either.",S03E22,783
I love you.,S03E22,784
"Oh, I love you too.",S03E22,785
I'm gonna miss you so much.,S03E22,786
Why you so sad?,S03E22,787
"Well because we're saying goodbye, Charlie, and",S03E22,788
It's a very hard thing to do.,S03E22,789
"Then say, hello.",S03E22,790
Yeah.,S03E22,791
"Yeah, maybe that's easier.",S03E22,792
"Hello, Teddy.",S03E22,793
"Hello, Spencer.",S03E22,794
Home sweet home.,S03E22,795
"Oh! Gabriel Duncan, what is going on?",S03E22,796
This is my new room.,S03E22,797
I didn't think you knew about the attic.,S03E22,798
"Well, the word gets around.",S03E22,799
"It took 13 years, but it got around.",S03E22,800
"Honey, you cannot turn the attic into your bedroom.",S03E22,801
"You can't, but maybe I can.",S03E22,802
What?,S03E22,803
"Well, I've been looking for something to talk about on TV tomorrow,",S03E22,804
and this is perfect!,S03E22,805
"My house was too small, but I had a brainstorm.",S03E22,806
You had a brainstorm?,S03E22,807
"Well, it sure wasn't Skippy.",S03E22,808
No no no.,S03E22,809
"Hi, Teddy, remember me?",S03E22,810
"Not now, P.",S03E22,811
J.,S03E22,812
"Oh, I don't know any P.",S03E22,813
J.,S03E22,814
I'm Socky the sock puppet.,S03E22,815
"Yeah, I remember.",S03E22,816
"When you were little and feeling sad, I used to cheer you up.",S03E22,817
And that's what I'm here to do now.,S03E22,818
Let's turn that frown upside down!,S03E22,819
I don't think I can.,S03E22,820
"Better let me handle this, Socky.",S03E22,821
Okay.,S03E22,822
"I know it hurts, but trust me, this is the hardest part.",S03E22,823
I just miss him so much.,S03E22,824
It's gonna get better.,S03E22,825
It's gonna get better.,S03E22,826
I know because I've been through this.,S03E22,827
Remember when Skyler moved away? I thought my world was over,S03E22,828
"but,somehow I managed to move on.",S03E22,829
You will too.,S03E22,830
"Well, I just",S03E22,831
I don't want it to be over.,S03E22,832
Maybe it isn't.,S03E22,833
What do you mean?,S03E22,834
"Maybe someday, when the timing's right",S03E22,835
You and Spence will be together again.,S03E22,836
"Uh-oh, lint ball.",S03E22,837
"Hey, there it is.",S03E22,838
There's that smile.,S03E22,839
"Oh, Socky.",S03E22,840
When did my big brother get to be so wise?,S03E22,841
- When he dropped out of college.  - You did what?!,S03E22,842
I don't know what he's talking about.,S03E22,843
"How you feeling, sweetie?",S03E22,844
You doing okay?,S03E22,845
"I'm good, mommy.",S03E22,846
"Oh, honey, I was talking to Teddy.",S03E22,847
"No, I'm okay, mom.",S03E22,848
But don't worry about me.,S03E22,849
Today is your big day.,S03E22,850
"Hey, mommy's gonna be on TV.",S03E22,851
Yeah yeah.,S03E22,852
"Teddy, look, if you ever need to talk.",S03E22,853
- You know I'm here for you.,S03E22,854
- Thanks.,S03E22,855
"Go ahead, tell her.",S03E22,856
Tell her you lied about the sleepover and went to Boston.,S03E22,857
Now's the perfect time.,S03E22,858
She's in a good mood and,S03E22,859
Ooh! Grapes.,S03E22,860
"Yes yes, much better.",S03E22,861
Much better.,S03E22,862
Been wanting to get rid of that door for years.,S03E22,863
It really opens the space up.,S03E22,864
"Bob, what is going on? Why do things keep breaking?",S03E22,865
"Honey, things break.",S03E22,866
Happens all the time. The real question,S03E22,867
Is why weren't things breaking before?,S03E22,868
"Thanks, Phil. And now let's say hello",S03E22,869
to mommy blogger Amy Duncan.,S03E22,870
"- Good morning, Amy.",S03E22,871
"- Good morning, Jan.",S03E22,872
"And Good Morning, Denver.",S03E22,873
"So what are you going to talk to us about today, Amy?",S03E22,874
"Problem-solving, Jan.",S03E22,875
"When your nest is as full as this mama bird's,",S03E22,876
you're always finding ways to make more room.,S03E22,877
"All of my loyal readers know that my youngest daughter Charlie,",S03E22,878
shares a room with her sister Skippy.,S03E22,879
- Who?  - Shh!,S03E22,880
"And that Skippy is quite a handful, isn't she?",S03E22,881
"Oh, don't get me started, Jan.",S03E22,882
Anyway,S03E22,883
"Now that baby Toby needs his own room,",S03E22,884
"I have to find someplace to put my teenage boy, Gabe.",S03E22,885
"And believe me, we tried everywhere",S03E22,886
"The living room, the basement, even the front porch.",S03E22,887
And then it hit me,S03E22,888
Why not clear out the attic and convert it into a really cool loft space?,S03E22,889
"Well, that's exactly what I did.",S03E22,890
"It was a lot of hard work, but as I always say,",S03E22,891
a mama bird's job is to build the perfect nest.,S03E22,892
"Could you hold this, Jan?",S03E22,893
"Let's kick it back to the studio, Jan.",S03E22,894
"No no no, I think we'll keep it right here.",S03E22,895
"What just happened, Amy?",S03E22,896
Good question. Bob?,S03E22,897
"Um, okay.",S03E22,898
"Uh, you know those termites I brought home the other day?",S03E22,899
They kinda got out.,S03E22,900
You let termites eat our house?,S03E22,901
- I dropped out of college.  - What?!,S03E22,902
And I went to Boston without your permission.,S03E22,903
- What?!  - Wow!,S03E22,904
"Mama bird, it looks like your nest is falling apart",S03E22,905
In more ways than one. What do you have to say?,S03E22,906
This whole thing is a disaster.,S03E22,907
Might as well tell her that Skippy's a lie too.,S03E22,908
Just go ahead.,S03E22,909
Just do it.,S03E22,910
And now for the weather.,S03E22,911
The skies are,S03E22,912
Sunny and clear.,S03E22,913
"Back to you, Phil.",S03E22,914
"Okay, you guys, come on.",S03E22,915
"Come on, let's go.",S03E22,916
Shake a leg.,S03E22,917
I finally get my own room and now we have to move out.,S03E22,918
It's just for a couple of nights.,S03E22,919
"We're gonna get the house checked out, make sure everything's safe",S03E22,920
Take care of the termite problem.,S03E22,921
I thought that was implied.,S03E22,922
And then we are gonna move back in,S03E22,923
and everything's gonna be back to normal.,S03E22,924
"What do you mean, normal?",S03E22,925
- P.,S03E22,926
J.,S03E22,927

"- Dad brought termites in the house.  - Well, Gabe",S03E22,930
- What did you do?  - Nothing.,S03E22,931
"As usual, I'm the good one.",S03E22,932
"Bob, this family is completely falling apart.",S03E22,933
"No, it isn't.",S03E22,934
"Look, guys, I dropped out of college for a reason.",S03E22,935
I want to go to culinary school.,S03E22,936
"I'm good at cooking, I'm passionate about it and I look good in the hat.",S03E22,937
"Okay, well, I feel better now that you have a plan.",S03E22,938
"Yeah, well, as for you, young lady, you are grounded.",S03E22,939
You're gonna be spending a lotta time in your room.,S03E22,940
I don't have a room.,S03E22,941
"Well, we're gonna find you a room and I'm gonna put you in it.",S03E22,942
All right.,S03E22,943
"Come on, guys, let's go.",S03E22,944
- Can you  - Yeah.,S03E22,945
Thank you.,S03E22,946
"Okay, house, see you in a couple of days.",S03E22,947
Or longer.,S03E22,948
"Hi, Charlie, I'm back. Um, where was I?",S03E22,949
"Oh, right worst day ever.",S03E22,950
So the whole house was eaten by termites and we don't have a place to live.,S03E22,951
Ugh.,S03E22,952
"Yeah, it's a disaster.",S03E22,953
"Well, not for you.",S03E22,954
You have your own apartment.,S03E22,955
Oh yeah.,S03E22,956
That makes me feel better.,S03E22,957
See ya.,S03E22,958
"Well, the rest of us have no idea",S03E22,959
"where we'll end up, but I'm sure we'll be fine.",S03E22,960
"But just in case, wish us good luck, Charlie.",S03E22,961
- He was visiting BIPA.  - Whapa?,S03E22,962
"BIPA, the bostotin",S03E22,963
Bostotin sorry.,S03E22,964
"Okay, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.",S03E22,965
"- Whapa?  - BIPA, the bostonin",S03E22,966
"BIPA, the Boston instit",S03E22,967
Whapa?,S03E22,968
It's all going so well.,S03E22,969
"Hey, sweetie.",S03E22,970
"Oh, there's some sandwich fictions if",S03E22,971
- I can't say that word.,S03E22,972
- Go back to one.,S03E22,973
I'm from the South.,S03E22,974
I should be able to say fixins.,S03E22,975
"Well, for one thing, there's no light.",S03E22,976
Porch light.,S03E22,977
No.,S03E22,978
- Porch light's right here.,S03E22,979
- It's right there.,S03E22,980
So how's the long-distance relationship going?,S03E22,981
Not go,S03E22,982
"There's, like, a motorcycle gang going by the set right now.",S03E22,983
I don't know I'm just kinda in shock.,S03E22,984
"Yeah, me too.",S03E22,985
Who's ready for some delicious New England chicken noodle chowder?,S03E22,986
Shoulder bread?,S03E22,987
"Well, Charlie, here we are in our hotel room, and we're not on vacation.",S03E23.ass,0
"Confused? Well, get comfortable, because it's a doozy.",S03E23.ass,1
"Charlie, get out of the bathroom!",S03E23.ass,2
In a minute!,S03E23.ass,3
Hey.,S03E23.ass,4
"Come on, guys.",S03E23.ass,5
Huh?.,S03E23.ass,6
Not so bad.,S03E23.ass,7
Kind of an adventure.,S03E23.ass,8
"- Oh, save it.",S03E23.ass,9
- Be quiet! Shut up.,S03E23.ass,10
Come on.,S03E23.ass,11
I'm just trying to make the best of it.,S03E23.ass,12
- Because you caused it.,S03E23.ass,13
- Not totally my fault.,S03E23.ass,14
- Then whose fault was it? - I'll get back to you on that.,S03E23.ass,15
Ugh.,S03E23.ass,16
"Teddy, I need a hand.",S03E23.ass,17
So how we got here is kind of a long story.,S03E23.ass,18
Let's just say this is the worst day in Duncan family history.,S03E23.ass,19
"- Teddy, now! - I'm coming!",S03E23.ass,20
To be continued.,S03E23.ass,21
"Oh. You hear that, Toby?",S03E23.ass,22
It's called quiet.,S03E23.ass,23
"Enjoy it while you can, because in this house it doesn't last long.",S03E23.ass,24
- Mom! - Hmm? Told you.,S03E23.ass,25
Why is Toby's crib in my room?,S03E23.ass,26
Because you two are sharing a room now.,S03E23.ass,27
- We talked about this.,S03E23.ass,28
"- No, we didn't.",S03E23.ass,29
"We didn't? Oh, well, Toby and I talked, and he's fine with it.",S03E23.ass,30
I I can't share a room with a baby.,S03E23.ass,31
I'm a teenager now.,S03E23.ass,32
I need my own space.,S03E23.ass,33
"Well, I'm sorry, honey, but we only have so many rooms.",S03E23.ass,34
"Besides, you love Toby.",S03E23.ass,35
This isn't about love.,S03E23.ass,36
This is about square footage.,S03E23.ass,37
"Well, if it makes it any easier,",S03E23.ass,38
Toby's about the same age you were when you moved in with P.,S03E23.ass,39
J.,S03E23.ass,40
"Yeah, but with me and P.",S03E23.ass,41
J.,S03E23.ass,42
", the little brother was in charge.",S03E23.ass,43
That ain't happening with us.,S03E23.ass,44
Oh aren't you adorable?,S03E23.ass,45
"Stop that, Gabe! Stay strong.",S03E23.ass,46
Today's all burnt toast ,S03E23.ass,47
"Running late, and dad jokes",S03E23.ass,48
Has anybody seen my left shoe,S03E23.ass,49
"I close my eyes, take a bite",S03E23.ass,50
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud",S03E23.ass,51
There it is up on the roof,S03E23.ass,52
"I've been there, I've survived",S03E23.ass,53
So just take my advice,S03E23.ass,54
"Hang in there, baby",S03E23.ass,55
Things are crazy,S03E23.ass,56
But I know your future's bright,S03E23.ass,57
"Hang in there, baby",S03E23.ass,58
There's no maybe,S03E23.ass,59
Everything turns out all right,S03E23.ass,60
Sure life is up and down,S03E23.ass,61
But trust me it comes back around,S03E23.ass,62
You're gonna love who you turn out to be,S03E23.ass,63
"Hang in there, baby.",S03E23.ass,64
"Oh, hey, P.",S03E23.ass,65
J.,S03E23.ass,66
you are a good cook.,S03E23.ass,67
Could you taste this and tell me what you think?,S03E23.ass,68
Sure.,S03E23.ass,69
Um,S03E23.ass,70
What is it?,S03E23.ass,71
"Well, that's not a good question.",S03E23.ass,72
It's New England clam chowder.,S03E23.ass,73
"Ah. Well, I'm not getting any chowder",S03E23.ass,74
Or clams.,S03E23.ass,75
Or even England.,S03E23.ass,76
"It is new, though.",S03E23.ass,77
Oh man!,S03E23.ass,78
I wanted to make Spencer a special welcome-home lunch.,S03E23.ass,79
He was visiting BIPA.,S03E23.ass,80
"BIPA, the Boston Institute of Performing Arts.",S03E23.ass,81
He's hoping to go there next Fall.,S03E23.ass,82
"There he is. Hey, um, do you think you could rescue this?",S03E23.ass,83
- No problem.,S03E23.ass,84
- Thank you.,S03E23.ass,85
Step one.,S03E23.ass,86
Oh! I'm so glad you're home.,S03E23.ass,87
- So how was BIPA? - Supa.,S03E23.ass,88
It's how they say super in Boston.,S03E23.ass,89
"I know. Hey, you wanna hear how they say,",S03E23.ass,90
go park your car in Harvard Yard?,S03E23.ass,91
Pahk your cah in hahvahd yahd.,S03E23.ass,92
Supa.,S03E23.ass,93
Mine's better.,S03E23.ass,94
"So hey, how was it?",S03E23.ass,95
"Oh my gosh, the school is amazing.",S03E23.ass,96
"- I mean, I loved it.",S03E23.ass,97
- That's awesome.,S03E23.ass,98
So when do you find out if you got in?,S03E23.ass,99
I already found out.,S03E23.ass,100
They accepted me.,S03E23.ass,101
"Way to go, boyfriend!",S03E23.ass,102
"Oh yeah, uh-huh.",S03E23.ass,103
Why am I the only one doing a happy dance?,S03E23.ass,104
"Well, because because there's one other thing.",S03E23.ass,105
"Um, they want me to start a little early.",S03E23.ass,106
"Well, like how early?",S03E23.ass,107
Monday.,S03E23.ass,108
"- What?  - Yeah, it's called early enrollment.",S03E23.ass,109
"They have a space available and if I want it, I have to take it right now.",S03E23.ass,110
But you haven't finished high school.,S03E23.ass,111
"Yeah, I know, but I already have enough credits to graduate.",S03E23.ass,112
Wow.,S03E23.ass,113
This is,S03E23.ass,114
Wow.,S03E23.ass,115
"Hey, Teddy",S03E23.ass,116
I haven't made my decision yet.,S03E23.ass,117
"I mean, I wanted to talk to you first.",S03E23.ass,118
What do you think?,S03E23.ass,119
I don't know.,S03E23.ass,120
I'm just kind of in shock.,S03E23.ass,121
"Yeah, me too.",S03E23.ass,122
Who's ready for some delicious New England chicken noodle chowder?,S03E23.ass,123
Denver Omelet?,S03E23.ass,124
"Guys, guys, I had an unbelievable day at work.",S03E23.ass,125
Wait until I tell you what happened.,S03E23.ass,126
"Oh, I think I hear Toby.",S03E23.ass,127
Baby's right there.,S03E23.ass,128
"- Oh, then I think I hear Charlie.",S03E23.ass,129
- Charlie's at a play date.,S03E23.ass,130
"I'm trying to get out of a bug story, work with me here.",S03E23.ass,131
Okay. So I'm doing a routine spray job over at the Andersons',S03E23.ass,132
"They have a monthly maintenance package,",S03E23.ass,133
so that means I go every other Tuesday.,S03E23.ass,134
"So the first Tuesday is perimeter, the second Tuesday's interior.",S03E23.ass,135
- I think I hear the doorbell.,S03E23.ass,136
"- Oh no, you don't.",S03E23.ass,137
"Anyway, long story short",S03E23.ass,138
- I captured these bad boys.,S03E23.ass,139
- Ugh.,S03E23.ass,140
Huh?,S03E23.ass,141
Brazilian termites.,S03E23.ass,142
"Very rare, very destructive and they've never been found in North America",S03E23.ass,143
Until now.,S03E23.ass,144
"Well, if they're so destructive, why would you bring them into our house?",S03E23.ass,145
Our wooden house?,S03E23.ass,146
"Honey, I'm not an idiot.",S03E23.ass,147
This container termite-proof.,S03E23.ass,148
- Are you sure? - I am sure.,S03E23.ass,149
"Besides, it's only gonna be for one night.",S03E23.ass,150
Tomorrow I'm taking em to the University of Denver.,S03E23.ass,151
This could land me in the exterminator hall of fame.,S03E23.ass,152
"Bob honey, that doesn't exist.",S03E23.ass,153
"Honey, yes, it does.",S03E23.ass,154
It's in Detroit.,S03E23.ass,155
"Used to be in Cleveland, but they had to move it.",S03E23.ass,156
Rat problem.,S03E23.ass,157
"So I know that it's a great opportunity,",S03E23.ass,158
"but if Spencer leaves now, I'm gonna be so sad.",S03E23.ass,159
We have so many plans for the rest of the year.,S03E23.ass,160
"When I get a boyfriend, we're gonna make bunch of plans too.",S03E23.ass,161
Maybe you should make a plan to get a boyfriend.,S03E23.ass,162
Maybe you should make a plan not to tell me to make a plan.,S03E23.ass,163
"Volleyball friends, huh?",S03E23.ass,164
"Well, one problem at a time.",S03E23.ass,165
So Spencer asked me what I thought he should do,S03E23.ass,166
And I don't know what to tell him.,S03E23.ass,167
"I think if you're lucky enough to get a boyfriend,",S03E23.ass,168
you should never ever let him go,S03E23.ass,169
Even if you have to lock him in the basement and not tell anybody.,S03E23.ass,170
So,S03E23.ass,171
"Of course I don't want Spencer to go,",S03E23.ass,172
but I also don't want to be the one to keep him from going.,S03E23.ass,173
"Oh man. I wish I had some experience with these things,",S03E23.ass,174
but for some reason boys find me weird and off-putting.,S03E23.ass,175
"Not just boys, sweetie.",S03E23.ass,176
"Kelsey, what do you think?",S03E23.ass,177
I think whatever happens is gonna be great.,S03E23.ass,178
"But if Spencer goes, then Teddy will be crushed.",S03E23.ass,179
"- You make a good point. - And if he doesn't go,",S03E23.ass,180
- he might be miserable.,S03E23.ass,181
"- That's a good point, too.",S03E23.ass,182
So what are you saying?,S03E23.ass,183
That I agree with everybody.,S03E23.ass,184
But you can't agree with everybody.,S03E23.ass,185
You are absolutely right.,S03E23.ass,186
You just did it again!,S03E23.ass,187
"Okay, I've made my decision.",S03E23.ass,188
- What is it? - I need some new friends.,S03E23.ass,189
My little Deedee just loves playing with your little Charlie.,S03E23.ass,190
Oh.,S03E23.ass,191
"Although, last time she asked me, why does Charlie have a boy's name?",S03E23.ass,192
And I didn't know what to tell her.,S03E23.ass,193
"Hey, honey. How's your play date going?",S03E23.ass,194
- Eh.,S03E23.ass,195
- Mmm.,S03E23.ass,196
Follow up question: Where's Deedee?,S03E23.ass,197
In jail.,S03E23.ass,198
Final question: What does jail mean exactly?,S03E23.ass,199
"Uh, well, it means, we'd better go check.",S03E23.ass,200
"Oh, my.",S03E23.ass,201
Oh.,S03E23.ass,202
"Oh, Deedee.",S03E23.ass,203
- Not funny.,S03E23.ass,204
"- Oh, sorry.",S03E23.ass,205
- Oh.,S03E23.ass,206
"- Yeah, you guys go play.",S03E23.ass,207
Maybe we should just stay in here with the girls for a while.,S03E23.ass,208
- Sounds like a good idea.,S03E23.ass,209
"- Okay, sure.",S03E23.ass,210
"Well, at least this will make a good post for my blog.",S03E23.ass,211
"Uh, you have a blog?",S03E23.ass,212
I call it Mama Debbie's Daily Doing's.,S03E23.ass,213
"Oh, you're serious.",S03E23.ass,214
You betcha.,S03E23.ass,215
"I post recipes, offer helpful hints",S03E23.ass,216
Share fun things Doug Dooley and I do together.,S03E23.ass,217
Just passing along some of the things I've learned about motherhood and such.,S03E23.ass,218
"Wow, and you've based this on your vast experience with one child?",S03E23.ass,219
And one on the way for a total of two.,S03E23.ass,220
Oh.,S03E23.ass,221
I have a total of five.,S03E23.ass,222
It's not a competition.,S03E23.ass,223
It wasn't.,S03E23.ass,224
- What are you doing down here? - Toby kept me up all night.,S03E23.ass,225
Ah.,S03E23.ass,226
It's called payback.,S03E23.ass,227
"When you were a baby, you used to make my life miserable, too.",S03E23.ass,228
I will never forget the night I woke up in your crib and you were in my bed.,S03E23.ass,229
I still have no idea how you did that.,S03E23.ass,230
"Well, me and Toby sharing a room is not gonna work.",S03E23.ass,231
Something has to be done now.,S03E23.ass,232
Oh! Are you gonna do something bad?,S03E23.ass,233
Because that'd be great,S03E23.ass,234
- For me. - What are you talking about?,S03E23.ass,235
"Well, I have to break some difficult news to mom and dad,",S03E23.ass,236
and they're not gonna be happy.,S03E23.ass,237
"So I was thinking maybe if you got in trouble,",S03E23.ass,238
I could sneak my news in and kind of piggyback on your badness.,S03E23.ass,239
"Well, what's the news?",S03E23.ass,240
"Oh, it's nothing.",S03E23.ass,241
"You know, I'd get it out of you, but I am way too tired.",S03E23.ass,242
So what do you think?,S03E23.ass,243
You gonna be getting into trouble anytime soon?,S03E23.ass,244
I don't know.,S03E23.ass,245
It's different.,S03E23.ass,246
I'm a teenager now.,S03E23.ass,247
"Well, what kind of attitude is that?",S03E23.ass,248
That is quitter talk.,S03E23.ass,249
Brazilian termites.,S03E23.ass,250
This is the most exciting thing,S03E23.ass,251
since I discovered those Ukrainian grub worms in 06.,S03E23.ass,252
"Excuse me, I discovered those.",S03E23.ass,253
"No, I was in the crawl space.",S03E23.ass,254
You were in the port-a-john.,S03E23.ass,255
Fine.,S03E23.ass,256
Here.,S03E23.ass,257
Feast your eyes on those little beauties.,S03E23.ass,258
I don't see em.,S03E23.ass,259
"- Well, they're in there. - Are you sure?",S03E23.ass,260
All I see are two little holes.,S03E23.ass,261
Holes?!,S03E23.ass,262
Oh no.,S03E23.ass,263
No no no! They ate right through the plastic!,S03E23.ass,264
"Oh, this is bad.",S03E23.ass,265
This is really bad.,S03E23.ass,266
"Okay, look, we gotta wipe em out before they multiply",S03E23.ass,267
"More importantly, before Amy finds out.",S03E23.ass,268
"Well, we could tent the place.",S03E23.ass,269
"Hey, there you go.",S03E23.ass,270
She'll never notice a giant gas-filled tarp covering the house.,S03E23.ass,271
"Well, then what are we gonna do?",S03E23.ass,272
I've got an idea.,S03E23.ass,273
To the bug mobile!,S03E23.ass,274
I love when he does that.,S03E23.ass,275
"Hey, sweetie, can you go get me the jail? Mommy needs to do laundry.",S03E23.ass,276
- Okay.,S03E23.ass,277
"- Thank you, sweetie.",S03E23.ass,278
"Hi, Charlie.",S03E23.ass,279
"Hey, mom.",S03E23.ass,280
"- Hey, sweetie. - What you doing?",S03E23.ass,281
Working on my mommy blog.,S03E23.ass,282
Mommy blog? That doesn't sound like you.,S03E23.ass,283
I am gonna kick Debbie Dooley's butt.,S03E23.ass,284
That sounds like you.,S03E23.ass,285
The only problem is I'm having trouble coming up with topics.,S03E23.ass,286
What kind of stuff does Debbie post about?,S03E23.ass,287
"- Recipes - Ooh, so that's out.",S03E23.ass,288
"She also writes about fun stuff she does with her husband, so that's out too.",S03E23.ass,289
"Hey, where is Gabe? He's always up to something?",S03E23.ass,290
"Well, here's hoping.",S03E23.ass,291
I mean for you and your blog.,S03E23.ass,292
Not for me.,S03E23.ass,293
Why would I need him to do anything bad?,S03E23.ass,294
Coming!,S03E23.ass,295
- Hey.,S03E23.ass,296
- Hi.,S03E23.ass,297
"- So listen, I - So, Teddy, I",S03E23.ass,298
"- You first. - Okay, um",S03E23.ass,299
I'm just gonna come out and say it.,S03E23.ass,300
I think you should go to Boston.,S03E23.ass,301
Because I was kinda leaning towards not going.,S03E23.ass,302
- Why? - I just don't think I can leave you.,S03E23.ass,303

That would be very bad.,S03E23.ass,362
But she's not gonna find out.,S03E23.ass,363

So why don't you?,S03E23.ass,455
Fly all the way to Boston by myself?,S03E23.ass,456
My mom and dad would never let me do that.,S03E23.ass,457
Unless they didn't know about it.,S03E23.ass,458
You could just tell them that you're spending the weekend at my house.,S03E23.ass,459
That's good.,S03E23.ass,460
I like that.,S03E23.ass,461

Thank you.,S03E23.ass,495
Thank you.,S03E23.ass,496
"And oh my goodness, this Skippy is a handful.",S03E23.ass,497
"Last night because she was afraid of the dark,",S03E23.ass,498
she set off a bunch of fireworks.,S03E23.ass,499
"Boy, did that cause a ruckus.",S03E23.ass,500
A very interesting woman.,S03E23.ass,501
What happened?,S03E23.ass,502
Did mom and dad kick you out because you did something horrible?,S03E23.ass,503
Please say yes.,S03E23.ass,504
"Dude, I didn't do anything.",S03E23.ass,505
This is my new room.,S03E23.ass,506
"Gabe, you can't live on the porch.",S03E23.ass,507
"- Why not? - Well, for one thing, there's no light.",S03E23.ass,508
Porch light.,S03E23.ass,509
There's no running water.,S03E23.ass,510
Hose.,S03E23.ass,511
What about a bathroom?,S03E23.ass,512
Hello.,S03E23.ass,513
"You've got it all figured out, huh?",S03E23.ass,514
Been so busy with your new room,S03E23.ass,515
you forgot to get in trouble for your big brother.,S03E23.ass,516
What are you so afraid to tell mom and dad?,S03E23.ass,517
Can't say.,S03E23.ass,518
It's bad.,S03E23.ass,519
"Oh, come on, it can't be that bad.",S03E23.ass,520
Just tell me what it is.,S03E23.ass,521
"Okay, but you have to promise not to tell anybody.",S03E23.ass,522
I promise.,S03E23.ass,523
All right.,S03E23.ass,524
Here goes.,S03E23.ass,525
I dropped out of college.,S03E23.ass,526
What?!,S03E23.ass,527
"Oh man, mom and dad are gonna kill you!",S03E23.ass,528
You just said it wasn't even that bad.,S03E23.ass,529
I didn't know what it was!,S03E23.ass,530
Wait. Why'd you quit college?,S03E23.ass,531
Because it's just it's just not for me.,S03E23.ass,532
And there's something else I wanna do.,S03E23.ass,533
"Well, you'd better do it quick,",S03E23.ass,534
because mom and dad are gonna kill you!,S03E23.ass,535
You said that already!,S03E23.ass,536
"Well, when are you gonna tell em?",S03E23.ass,537
I don't know.,S03E23.ass,538
"Soon, probably.",S03E23.ass,539
There's a chance dad might be in some hot water with mom.,S03E23.ass,540
I'm gonna wait and see how that plays out.,S03E23.ass,541
"Hey, can I use your bathroom?",S03E23.ass,542
"- Yeah, sure, go ahead.",S03E23.ass,543

Just stretching.,S03E23.ass,553
Before you eat?,S03E23.ass,554

So what's bringing you to Boston?,S03E23.ass,556
"Well, hopefully this plane.",S03E23.ass,557
"No, actually, I'm gonna go visit my boyfriend.",S03E23.ass,558
We're in a long-distance relationship.,S03E23.ass,559
Ah.,S03E23.ass,560
"Well, you're sitting next to the right guy.",S03E23.ass,561
I travel for a living and I've got tons of tips.,S03E23.ass,562
"First off, don't travel for a living.",S03E23.ass,563
"Seriously now, you're always gonna have to have one of these things handy.",S03E23.ass,564
"Well, it looks very comfortable.",S03E23.ass,565
I always carry a spare.,S03E23.ass,566
Thanks.,S03E23.ass,567
Hungry?,S03E23.ass,568

I can't wait to see the look on his face.,S03E23.ass,586
I'm going to Denver to surprise my girlfriend.,S03E23.ass,587

It's open.,S03E23.ass,589
Surprise!,S03E23.ass,590
This is crazy.,S03E23.ass,591

I came here to surprise him.,S03E23.ass,597
"Well, that was exciting for a second.",S03E23.ass,598
Teddy.,S03E23.ass,599
You're never gonna guess where I am.,S03E23.ass,600
- Denver? - Huh.,S03E23.ass,601
I thought that would be harder.,S03E23.ass,602
"Yeah, well, guess where I am.",S03E23.ass,603
- Boston! - What?,S03E23.ass,604
"Well, I guess we both had the same idea. Surprise!",S03E23.ass,605
"Oh gosh, this is terrible.",S03E23.ass,606
We're not gonna be able to see each other.,S03E23.ass,607
"Yes, we are.",S03E23.ass,608
"Okay, you stay right there.",S03E23.ass,609
I'll just take the first flight back.,S03E23.ass,610
"Well, I mean I'm already at your front door.",S03E23.ass,611
I might as well say hi to your parents.,S03E23.ass,612
"Don't. No no, what are you doing?",S03E23.ass,613
They don't know that I'm out here.,S03E23.ass,614
"- Well, I just rang the bell. - Just move!",S03E23.ass,615
"Son, that is what we call ding-dong ditch.",S03E23.ass,616
"Hey, Charlie, wanna play a game?",S03E23.ass,617
"Okay, so I'm thinking of a number,",S03E23.ass,618
"and if you guess it, you get to have Toby move into your room.",S03E23.ass,619
Nice try.,S03E23.ass,620
Hey P.,S03E23.ass,621
J.,S03E23.ass,622
", you wanna play a game?.",S03E23.ass,623
"Still trying to find a bedroom, huh?",S03E23.ass,624
"Yeah, and I've tried everywhere",S03E23.ass,625
"The living room, the basement, the front porch.",S03E23.ass,626
I assume you've ruled out the attic. Ugh!,S03E23.ass,627
- The what? - The attic. Ugh!,S03E23.ass,628
We have an attic?,S03E23.ass,629
Yeah.,S03E23.ass,630
It's upstairs.,S03E23.ass,631
"Yeah yeah, that'd be the place for it.",S03E23.ass,632
Wait. Why didn't I know we had an attic?,S03E23.ass,633
You didn't know we had a tree house either.,S03E23.ass,634
You gotta start looking up.,S03E23.ass,635
See? Ugh!,S03E23.ass,636
It's not ugh! It'sHey!,S03E23.ass,637

Thanks. So,S03E23.ass,643
My boyfriend decided to surprise me and flew out to Denver.,S03E23.ass,644
"Oh, the old double surprise gone bad.",S03E23.ass,645
I could sing a few bars of that one.,S03E23.ass,646
"But you're not going to, right?",S03E23.ass,647
"No no, they frown upon that during the safety announcement.",S03E23.ass,648
"It's just that by the time I get back,",S03E23.ass,649
Spencer I will barely have any time together.,S03E23.ass,650
All long-distance relationships are brutal.,S03E23.ass,651
You try to make em work.,S03E23.ass,652
"You email, you text, you video chat",S03E23.ass,653
Then one night you decide,S03E23.ass,654
you'd rather watch a Battlestar Galactica Marathon,S03E23.ass,655
and suddenly you're the bad guy.,S03E23.ass,656
I'm pretty sure that won't happen to me.,S03E23.ass,657
Stay away from the first season.,S03E23.ass,658
It's addictive.,S03E23.ass,659
Good to know.,S03E23.ass,660
All I'm trying to say is there's no substitute,S03E23.ass,661
"for being in the same place together,",S03E23.ass,662
and anyone who thinks otherwise is just kidding themselves.,S03E23.ass,663
"Oh, except for you and your boyfriend.",S03E23.ass,664
You kids'll be fine.,S03E23.ass,665
This is the Captain speaking. Just wanna let you know,S03E23.ass,666

"It took 13 years, but it got around.",S03E23.ass,800
"Honey, you cannot turn the attic into your bedroom.",S03E23.ass,801
"You can't, but maybe I can.",S03E23.ass,802

and this is perfect!,S03E23.ass,805
"My house was too small, but I had a brainstorm.",S03E23.ass,806
You had a brainstorm?,S03E23.ass,807

"When you were little and feeling sad, I used to cheer you up.",S03E23.ass,817
And that's what I'm here to do now.,S03E23.ass,818
Let's turn that frown upside down!,S03E23.ass,819
I don't think I can.,S03E23.ass,820
"Better let me handle this, Socky.",S03E23.ass,821
Okay.,S03E23.ass,822
"I know it hurts, but trust me, this is the hardest part.",S03E23.ass,823
I just miss him so much.,S03E23.ass,824

Remember when Skyler moved away? I thought my world was over,S03E23.ass,828
"but,somehow I managed to move on.",S03E23.ass,829
You will too.,S03E23.ass,830
"Well, I just",S03E23.ass,831
I don't want it to be over.,S03E23.ass,832
Maybe it isn't.,S03E23.ass,833
What do you mean?,S03E23.ass,834
"Maybe someday, when the timing's right",S03E23.ass,835
You and Spence will be together again.,S03E23.ass,836
"Uh-oh, lint ball.",S03E23.ass,837
"Hey, there it is.",S03E23.ass,838
There's that smile.,S03E23.ass,839
"Oh, Socky.",S03E23.ass,840
When did my big brother get to be so wise?,S03E23.ass,841

- You know I'm here for you.,S03E23.ass,854

She's in a good mood and,S03E23.ass,859
Ooh! Grapes.,S03E23.ass,860
"Yes yes, much better.",S03E23.ass,861
Much better.,S03E23.ass,862
Been wanting to get rid of that door for years.,S03E23.ass,863
It really opens the space up.,S03E23.ass,864
"Bob, what is going on? Why do things keep breaking?",S03E23.ass,865
"Honey, things break.",S03E23.ass,866
Happens all the time. The real question,S03E23.ass,867
Is why weren't things breaking before?,S03E23.ass,868
"Thanks, Phil. And now let's say hello",S03E23.ass,869
to mommy blogger Amy Duncan.,S03E23.ass,870

"Problem-solving, Jan.",S03E23.ass,875
"When your nest is as full as this mama bird's,",S03E23.ass,876
you're always finding ways to make more room.,S03E23.ass,877
"All of my loyal readers know that my youngest daughter Charlie,",S03E23.ass,878
shares a room with her sister Skippy.,S03E23.ass,879
- Who?  - Shh!,S03E23.ass,880
"And that Skippy is quite a handful, isn't she?",S03E23.ass,881
"Oh, don't get me started, Jan.",S03E23.ass,882
Anyway,S03E23.ass,883
"Now that baby Toby needs his own room,",S03E23.ass,884
"I have to find someplace to put my teenage boy, Gabe.",S03E23.ass,885
"And believe me, we tried everywhere",S03E23.ass,886
"The living room, the basement, even the front porch.",S03E23.ass,887
And then it hit me,S03E23.ass,888
Why not clear out the attic and convert it into a really cool loft space?,S03E23.ass,889
"Well, that's exactly what I did.",S03E23.ass,890
"It was a lot of hard work, but as I always say,",S03E23.ass,891
a mama bird's job is to build the perfect nest.,S03E23.ass,892
"Could you hold this, Jan?",S03E23.ass,893
"Let's kick it back to the studio, Jan.",S03E23.ass,894
"No no no, I think we'll keep it right here.",S03E23.ass,895
"What just happened, Amy?",S03E23.ass,896
Good question. Bob?,S03E23.ass,897
"Um, okay.",S03E23.ass,898
"Uh, you know those termites I brought home the other day?",S03E23.ass,899
They kinda got out.,S03E23.ass,900
You let termites eat our house?,S03E23.ass,901
- I dropped out of college.  - What?!,S03E23.ass,902
And I went to Boston without your permission.,S03E23.ass,903
- What?!  - Wow!,S03E23.ass,904
"Mama bird, it looks like your nest is falling apart",S03E23.ass,905
In more ways than one. What do you have to say?,S03E23.ass,906
This whole thing is a disaster.,S03E23.ass,907
Might as well tell her that Skippy's a lie too.,S03E23.ass,908
Just go ahead.,S03E23.ass,909
Just do it.,S03E23.ass,910
And now for the weather.,S03E23.ass,911
The skies are,S03E23.ass,912
Sunny and clear.,S03E23.ass,913
"Back to you, Phil.",S03E23.ass,914
"Okay, you guys, come on.",S03E23.ass,915
"Come on, let's go.",S03E23.ass,916
Shake a leg.,S03E23.ass,917
I finally get my own room and now we have to move out.,S03E23.ass,918
It's just for a couple of nights.,S03E23.ass,919
"We're gonna get the house checked out, make sure everything's safe",S03E23.ass,920
Take care of the termite problem.,S03E23.ass,921
I thought that was implied.,S03E23.ass,922
And then we are gonna move back in,S03E23.ass,923
and everything's gonna be back to normal.,S03E23.ass,924
"What do you mean, normal?",S03E23.ass,925

"As usual, I'm the good one.",S03E23.ass,932
"Bob, this family is completely falling apart.",S03E23.ass,933
"No, it isn't.",S03E23.ass,934
"Look, guys, I dropped out of college for a reason.",S03E23.ass,935
I want to go to culinary school.,S03E23.ass,936
"I'm good at cooking, I'm passionate about it and I look good in the hat.",S03E23.ass,937
"Okay, well, I feel better now that you have a plan.",S03E23.ass,938
"Yeah, well, as for you, young lady, you are grounded.",S03E23.ass,939
You're gonna be spending a lotta time in your room.,S03E23.ass,940
I don't have a room.,S03E23.ass,941
"Well, we're gonna find you a room and I'm gonna put you in it.",S03E23.ass,942
All right.,S03E23.ass,943
"Come on, guys, let's go.",S03E23.ass,944
- Can you  - Yeah.,S03E23.ass,945
Thank you.,S03E23.ass,946
"Okay, house, see you in a couple of days.",S03E23.ass,947
Or longer.,S03E23.ass,948
"Hi, Charlie, I'm back. Um, where was I?",S03E23.ass,949
"Oh, right worst day ever.",S03E23.ass,950
So the whole house was eaten by termites and we don't have a place to live.,S03E23.ass,951
Ugh.,S03E23.ass,952
"Yeah, it's a disaster.",S03E23.ass,953
"Well, not for you.",S03E23.ass,954
You have your own apartment.,S03E23.ass,955
Oh yeah.,S03E23.ass,956
That makes me feel better.,S03E23.ass,957
See ya.,S03E23.ass,958
"Well, the rest of us have no idea",S03E23.ass,959
"where we'll end up, but I'm sure we'll be fine.",S03E23.ass,960
"But just in case, wish us good luck, Charlie.",S03E23.ass,961

You're gonna love who you turn out to be.{\i0},S04E03,49
"Hang in there, baby.{\i0}",S04E03,50
You want to get that?,S04E03,51
And interact with people? No thanks.,S04E03,52
- Hi.,S04E03,53
- Hey.,S04E03,54
I'm Lauren. I'm new to the,S04E03,55
neighborhood and I'm looking for babysitting jobs.,S04E03,56
And I heard you guys have lots of babies.,S04E03,57
"Oh, that we do.",S04E03,58
But it also means that I have a lot of free babysitters.,S04E03,59
Dad dad dad.,S04E03,60
Shouldn't we keep our options open?,S04E03,61
- Hi.,S04E03,62
I'm Gabe.,S04E03,63
- Hi.,S04E03,64
I'm Lauren.,S04E03,65
I probably should interview her,S04E03,66
just to make sure she meets our high standards.,S04E03,67
"Can't just let anybody babysit for, uh",S04E03,68
"- Toby? - Toby, right.",S04E03,69
Yeah.,S04E03,70
Thank you.,S04E03,71
"So, Lauren, how long have you been babysitting?",S04E03,72
About a year.,S04E03,73
Okay.,S04E03,74
All right.,S04E03,75
Follow-up question. Do you have a boyfriend?,S04E03,76
What does that have to do with babysitting?,S04E03,77
"Oh, I'm interviewing for something else now.",S04E03,78
Oh.,S04E03,79
"In that case, I don't have a boyfriend.",S04E03,80
Do you have a girlfriend?,S04E03,81
I'm working on it.,S04E03,82
You're cute.,S04E03,83
"I am, aren't I?",S04E03,84
"So, you're new to the neighborhood, huh?",S04E03,85
"Yeah, I'm staying with my grandmother for a while.",S04E03,86
I can't wait to meet her.,S04E03,87
You already have.,S04E03,88
Oh no!,S04E03,89
Oh yes.,S04E03,90
"Let's go, Lauren.",S04E03,91
This is the one I warned you about.,S04E03,92
This is the Devil Child?,S04E03,93
But he seems so nice.,S04E03,94
That's what makes him the Devil Child.,S04E03,95
"Hey, people change.",S04E03,96
"- Oh, hey, PJ.",S04E03,97
"- Hey, sis.",S04E03,98
"So, I have a question for you.",S04E03,99
Where are you going to be tomorrow at 3:00 pm?,S04E03,100
Now I have an answer for you.,S04E03,101
Anywhere but here.,S04E03,102
Why can't I be here?,S04E03,103
"Because a guy is coming over to interview me for Yale,",S04E03,104
and so I want the house to myself.,S04E03,105
Because you're ashamed of me?,S04E03,106
Not just of you.,S04E03,107
Everybody.,S04E03,108
Oh.,S04E03,109
"Well, that makes me feel a little better.",S04E03,110
All right.,S04E03,111
I guess I can not be here tomorrow.,S04E03,112
Great.,S04E03,113
Thanks.,S04E03,114
"Oh, although I was gonna watch my cartoons tomorrow at 3:00.",S04E03,115
Can't you just skip a day?,S04E03,116
Can't you just skip your college interview?,S04E03,117
Why is your stuff more important than mine?,S04E03,118
"Because mine involves Yale,",S04E03,119
and yours involves a turtle with a suitcase.,S04E03,120
"It's a briefcase, and it's a portal to another dimension.",S04E03,121
I'm begging you.,S04E03,122
Please don't be here tomorrow.,S04E03,123
All right.,S04E03,124
I'll make other arrangements.,S04E03,125
Thank you.,S04E03,126
Got an interview for Yale.,S04E03,127
Grow up.,S04E03,128
Hey.,S04E03,129
Hey. What do we have here?,S04E03,130
"Well, one of my kids finally wanted to see where daddy works.",S04E03,131
"So, Charlie, what do you think?",S04E03,132
Can we go now?,S04E03,133
"Charlie, we just got here.",S04E03,134
Oh.,S04E03,135
You want to sit in daddy's chair?,S04E03,136
It spins around.,S04E03,137
- Okay.,S04E03,138
- Okay.,S04E03,139
"- Can I go next, boss? - We've been over this, Vern.",S04E03,140
"So, what have we got lined up for today?",S04E03,141
Same as yesterday.,S04E03,142
Nothing.,S04E03,143
"What? Man, what",S04E03,144
I don't get it.,S04E03,145
"Why is business down? I mean, we just put out new advertising.",S04E03,146
"Charlie, look.",S04E03,147
Huh?,S04E03,148
"- What do you think? - That's scary, daddy.",S04E03,149
It's not scary.,S04E03,150
It's clever.,S04E03,151
"Oh, you just can't read yet.",S04E03,152
"You don't realize this is a pun, see?",S04E03,153
Daddy's all dressed up like a boxer.,S04E03,154
So I'm gonna knock out your bug problems.,S04E03,155
Boxers knock things out.,S04E03,156
"Oh, that is clever.",S04E03,157
"- PJ, what you thinking about? - I've got a problem.",S04E03,158
I'm trying to figure out,S04E03,159
where to watch my cartoons tomorrow at 3:00.,S04E03,160
How about your place?,S04E03,161
"No, because Emmett's gonna be watching his cartoons then.",S04E03,162
"Boy, you think you have a",S04E03,163
problem then you hear something like that.,S04E03,164
What's your problem?,S04E03,165
"Well, I like this girl,",S04E03,166
but it turns out her grandmother's Mrs.,S04E03,167
Dabney.,S04E03,168
- Ooh.,S04E03,169
Oh.,S04E03,170
That is bad.,S04E03,171
- Yeah.,S04E03,172
"Normally, I'd have nothing",S04E03,173
"to do with anyone related to Dabney but,",S04E03,174
Lauren has that one quality,S04E03,175
I've never really found in a girl before.,S04E03,176
- What's that? - She likes me.,S04E03,177
"Sounds like one of a kind, man.",S04E03,178
You should go for it.,S04E03,179
You know what? You're right.,S04E03,180
Here goes nothing.,S04E03,181
"Oh hey, while you're there, will you find out if Mrs. D will be",S04E03,182
watching Yacky the Duck Tomorrow at 3:00?,S04E03,183
- Is Lauren here? - Yes.,S04E03,184
Can I see her?,S04E03,185
About what?,S04E03,186
That's between me and her.,S04E03,187
Right now what's between you and her is me.,S04E03,188
So start talking.,S04E03,189
"- Hi, Gabe.",S04E03,190
"- Hey, Lauren.",S04E03,191
Do you want to go roller skating tomorrow?,S04E03,192
"Can I, grandma?",S04E03,193
And now it's back to me.,S04E03,194
Pretty please?,S04E03,195
"Oh, all right.",S04E03,196
- Thanks.,S04E03,197
- Yes.,S04E03,198
What time will you be picking us up?,S04E03,199
Us?,S04E03,200
"Well, I'm not gonna let you two go unchaperoned.",S04E03,201
"You date her, you date me.",S04E03,202
Fine.,S04E03,203
I'll be by tomorrow around 1:00.,S04E03,204
Will you be taking us out for cheeseburgers?,S04E03,205
Don't push it.,S04E03,206
Wear something cute.,S04E03,207
"- Good morning, Vern.",S04E03,208
- Look what I found.,S04E03,209
The old me.,S04E03,210
"Big boy Bob, as the guys in the break room used to say.",S04E03,211
"The only guys in the break room are you and me, Vern.",S04E03,212
I guess I said it to myself.,S04E03,213
Why is he here?,S04E03,214
"Well, I've been thinking.",S04E03,215
We used to get a lot of,S04E03,216
jobs when this guy was the face of the company.,S04E03,217
But then,S04E03,218
This guy came along.,S04E03,219
"And as your little girl said, he's scary.",S04E03,220
He's also in shape.,S04E03,221
I think the new Bob is frightening the customers.,S04E03,222
This guy you want in your house.,S04E03,223
"He's warm, he's cuddly, he's gonna eat some cookies,",S04E03,224
maybe take a nap on your couch.,S04E03,225
I only did that once.,S04E03,226
"But this guy, he's tough, he's menacing,",S04E03,227
"he's gonna kill the bugs, but then what?",S04E03,228
Now he's got a taste for blood.,S04E03,229
"Oh, that's ridic what are you saying, Vern?",S04E03,230
You want me to put the weight back on?,S04E03,231
Oh no no.,S04E03,232
Of course not.,S04E03,233
Nobody's saying anything like that.,S04E03,234
No no.,S04E03,235
"Oh, lookie here.",S04E03,236
An ad for an all-you-can-eat buffet.,S04E03,237
And us with nothing to do.,S04E03,238
Okay.,S04E03,239
Hello.,S04E03,240

Yale 85.,S04E03,242

If all goes well.,S04E03,246
Can we start over?,S04E03,247
Hello.,S04E03,248
I'm Lionel Van Ness.,S04E03,249
Yale 85.,S04E03,250
"Please, make yourself comfortable.",S04E03,251
"Listen, I know these interviews can be intimidating,",S04E03,252
"but I just want you to relax, be yourself.",S04E03,253
We're just two people talking.,S04E03,254
Sounds good to me.,S04E03,255
"So, Teddy, what made you think about Yale?",S04E03,256
"Oh well, there are so many reasons.",S04E03,257
"But if I had to pick one,",S04E03,258
I guess I'd say I have a thing for bulldogs.,S04E03,259
It's the mascot.,S04E03,260
"Oh, hi. What's going on here?",S04E03,261
I told you.,S04E03,262
My college interview.,S04E03,263
"Oh, right.",S04E03,264
I'm sorry.,S04E03,265
I'm Amy Duncan.,S04E03,266
Teddy's mom.,S04E03,267
"Hello, Lionel Van Ness.",S04E03,268
Nice to meet you.,S04E03,269
"Uh, mom, what are you doing?",S04E03,270
I'm sitting in.,S04E03,271
You won't even know that I'm here.,S04E03,272
"That's all right with you, isn't it, Lionel?",S04E03,273
"Well, it's a bit unusual, but I guess it's okay.",S04E03,274
Great.,S04E03,275
"Come on in, boys.",S04E03,276
What is going on?,S04E03,277
"Okay, let's go back to where",S04E03,278
"you greet each other like you never met, okay?",S04E03,279
And with good energy.,S04E03,280
What is all this?,S04E03,281
"Oh, I'm sorry, Lionel.",S04E03,282
Allow me to explain.,S04E03,283
I'm a local TV personality.,S04E03,284
"And I'm filming a segment for my show Good Morning, Denver.",S04E03,285
And you two are gonna be on it.,S04E03,286
"No, we're not.",S04E03,287
"My sweet Teddy. She's so beautiful,",S04E03,288
it's hard to believe she's camera shy.,S04E03,289
"Mom, could I have a quick word with you in the kitchen?",S04E03,290
"- Sure, Sweetie.",S04E03,291
- Yes.,S04E03,292
Be right back.,S04E03,293
"Hey Ken, could you get him into a different shirt?",S04E03,294
One that goes with my eyes?,S04E03,295
- What are you doing?! - I'm killing two birds with one stone.,S04E03,296
"Teddy, I need a new segment for my show,",S04E03,297
and you need help getting into Yale.,S04E03,298
"Mom, how is this helping?",S04E03,299
Having your interview on TV is gonna make you stand out.,S04E03,300
And if I happen to win a,S04E03,301
"local emmy as well, well, it's a win-win.",S04E03,302
"Mom, this is really important to me,",S04E03,303
so just please don't blow it.,S04E03,304
"I'm not gonna blow it, okay? I just need five minutes.",S04E03,305
I'll get a couple of quick shots and I'll be on my way.,S04E03,306
"Five minutes, but that's it.",S04E03,307
"Thank you, honey.",S04E03,308
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.,S04E03,309
"One more thing, if you could",S04E03,310
find some time to mention the phrase um,S04E03,311
"Rick's Diner, quality you can taste",S04E03,312
that would be too much? Okay.,S04E03,313
So. We having fun yet?,S04E03,314
- No.,S04E03,315
- Good.,S04E03,316
"Oh, hey, guys.",S04E03,317
PJ! What the heck are you doing here?,S04E03,318
At the roller rink unexpectedly.,S04E03,319
"Oh, hello, Gabe.",S04E03,320
I just came by to roller skate.,S04E03,321
As I often do this time of day.,S04E03,322
"As long as you're here, you can chaperone us,",S04E03,323
and Mrs.,S04E03,324
Dabney can go home.,S04E03,325
Do you really think I'd leave my granddaughter with Devil Child,S04E03,326
and Devil Child's dimwitted brother?,S04E03,327
"Don't worry, Mrs.",S04E03,328
Dabney.,S04E03,329
Gabe and I will be here too.,S04E03,330
"Okay, new plan. You keep Dabney",S04E03,331
occupied so I can get some alone time with Lauren.,S04E03,332
- Alright you got it little bro.,S04E03,333
- Thanks.,S04E03,334
I will not let Mrs.,S04E03,335
Dabney out of my sight.,S04E03,336
I lost her.,S04E03,337
"- This is nice, huh? - Yeah.",S04E03,338
"Oh, I think it's a couples' skate.",S04E03,339
So I think we're supposed to hold hands.,S04E03,340
"Well, if we have to.",S04E03,341
If we have to.,S04E03,342
Oh no you don't.,S04E03,343
And now it's triple skate.,S04E03,344
Found her.,S04E03,345
"Also, I've always been interested in writing,",S04E03,346
"and I know that Yale has a great English Department which, um",S04E03,347
Is actually what drew me there in the first place.,S04E03,348
"You know, I've considered a career in in journalism and possibly",S04E03,349
Teaching.,S04E03,350
You're breathing on my neck.,S04E03,351
"Honey, it's for the camera.",S04E03,352
It's called a two-shot.,S04E03,353
"Are you getting this, Ken?",S04E03,354
What would you consider your greatest challenge?,S04E03,355
"Oh, you mean besides this?",S04E03,356
I have to say choosing the right major.,S04E03,357
Because I have so many different interests.,S04E03,358
"- It's gonna - You know, if I may, Lionel.",S04E03,359
"I think what Teddy's trying to say is that,",S04E03,360
she has been drawn to Yale because,S04E03,361
she wants to follow in her mother's footsteps.,S04E03,362
"Oh, did you go to Yale?",S04E03,363
I thought about it.,S04E03,364
But then I chose Southwest Denver Community College.,S04E03,365
The jewel of The Rockies.,S04E03,366
"You know, Yale's just been done to death, so.",S04E03,367
"Getting back to Teddy uh, tell me about your extracurriculars.",S04E03,368
"Uh, well, I've always had a passion for theater.",S04E03,369
- It's - I have a question.,S04E03,370
"You're gonna want to go tight on this, Ken.",S04E03,371
"As a concerned mother, I want to know about your meal plan.",S04E03,372
I am not gonna send my daughter all the way across the country,S04E03,373
if she doesn't have balanced nutrition and,S04E03,374
I'm sorry.,S04E03,375
I can do so much better.,S04E03,376
Let's just do that again.,S04E03,377
- As a concerned - Stop it!,S04E03,378
- What? - Your five minutes are up.,S04E03,379
You're done.,S04E03,380
"- Teddy, I'm just trying to help. - Who?",S04E03,381
Who are you helping? Because it's not me.,S04E03,382
"Guys, could you turn the camera off.",S04E03,383
Just take five.,S04E03,384
"I did it again, didn't I?",S04E03,385
"I'm sorry, Teddy.",S04E03,386
I'm so so sorry.,S04E03,387
I just sometimes I,S04E03,388
want to be on TV so bad that I lose my head.,S04E03,389
"Yeah, well, it's over.",S04E03,390
"So Mr. Van Ness, I'm",S04E03,391
Very sorry that we wasted your time.,S04E03,392
I know this thing has been a complete disaster.,S04E03,393
And I'm never going to Yale.,S04E03,394
"Actually, I'm very impressed with you.",S04E03,395
"Your grades are excellent, you're well-rounded,",S04E03,396
and now that I know you've accomplished everything,S04E03,397
under such difficult circumstances,S04E03,398
I'm gonna recommend you.,S04E03,399
Really?,S04E03,400
"Well, that's amazing!",S04E03,401
You're welcome!,S04E03,402
"- What's going on, boss? - We're doing a photo shoot, Vern.",S04E03,403
"Oh, we're finally gonna do that calendar?",S04E03,404
The men of Bob's Bugs Be Gone.,S04E03,405
Dibs on baby new year.,S04E03,406
"Yeah, I'm gonna need a minute to get that image out of my head.",S04E03,407
"No, I was thinking about what you said.",S04E03,408
About how the customers think I'm scary.,S04E03,409
- What about it? - Maybe you're right.,S04E03,410
So you know what? We should do new shots.,S04E03,411
"Make me look friendly and lovable,",S04E03,412
so that people will want me in their house killing things.,S04E03,413
Brilliant.,S04E03,414
Let's do it.,S04E03,415
S-s-super star.,S04E03,416
"Big star going far, there you are.",S04E03,417
S-s-super star.,S04E03,418
S-s-super star.,S04E03,419
Look so bright.,S04E03,420
Livin' right.,S04E03,421
Here all night.,S04E03,422
S-s-superstar.,S04E03,423
"This isn't working, is it?",S04E03,424
Too bad you don't have a puppy.,S04E03,425
Nobody can resist those little guys.,S04E03,426
"Oh, wait a minute.",S04E03,427
Wait a minute.,S04E03,428
I got something even better.,S04E03,429
"Now we're talking, boss.",S04E03,430
"Hey, I even have a new slogan.",S04E03,431
I'll protect your house just like it's my own baby.,S04E03,432
Love it.,S04E03,433
So how do I look?,S04E03,434
- Getting my smile okay? - I'm getting everything I need.,S04E03,435
Oh wow.,S04E03,436
I forgot how much fun dating can be.,S04E03,437
"If you ask us out again, we'll probably say yes.",S04E03,438
"All right, Mrs.",S04E03,439
"Dabney, let's see what you got.",S04E03,440
Oh no.,S04E03,441
I gotta keep my eye on these two.,S04E03,442
"Oh, I get it.",S04E03,443
You don't got any moves.,S04E03,444
"Oh, it's gonna be like that, huh? All right.",S04E03,445
"You two, hands to yourself.",S04E03,446
I gotta take PJ to school.,S04E03,447
- Let's go.,S04E03,448
- Okay.,S04E03,449
"Wow, Mrs. Dabney, you move pretty well for an old",S04E03,450
School skater.,S04E03,451
Why did you pause?,S04E03,452
I,S04E03,453
Sometimes do that.,S04E03,454
"You know, I was once in an ice skating contest",S04E03,455
where I picked Gabe up and twirled him over my head.,S04E03,456
Not gonna happen.,S04E03,457
"Oh, neither I nor the laws of gravity were suggesting it.",S04E03,458
"Sometimes you're smart, sometimes you're dumb.",S04E03,459
It's hard to keep up.,S04E03,460
I just want you to know,S04E03,461
"that no matter what your grandmother says,",S04E03,462
I'm not a bad guy.,S04E03,463
Maybe I like bad guys.,S04E03,464
- Ready to kick it up a notch? - Try and stop me!,S04E03,465
No!,S04E03,466
"Hey, Charlie. So piece of advice,",S04E03,467
"when it's time for your college interviews, just go to them.",S04E03,468
Don't let them come to you.,S04E03,469
"You know what? Actually, this applies to everything.",S04E03,470
"Playdates, sleepovers, first dates.",S04E03,471
Basically any social interaction.,S04E03,472
Can you do that somewhere else? I'm hurting over here.,S04E03,473
Gabe's a little cranky.,S04E03,474
He went on a date and had a little mishap.,S04E03,475
A mishap?,S04E03,476
I went looking for love and got a face full of Dabney.,S04E03,477
"Wish him good luck, Charlie.",S04E03,478
Peek-a-boo.,S04E03,479
I see you.,S04E03,480
Peek-a-boo! I see you.,S04E03,481
"Man, I'm so sick of this game.",S04E03,482
And this guy seems to love it.,S04E03,483
Peek-a-boo.,S04E03,484
I see you.,S04E03,485
"Oh, there's a new twist",S04E03,486
Not.,S04E03,487
Peek-a-boo! I see you.,S04E03,488
Anything but this.,S04E03,489
Wheels on the bus? Itsy bitsy spider? Something?,S04E03,490
Peek-a-boo.,S04E03,491
I see you.,S04E03,492
"Check, please?!",S04E03,493
3 o'clock.,S04E03,494
Time for Yacky the Duck.,S04E03,495
"Oh, thank goodness.",S04E03,496
"Oh, I've seen this one already.",S04E03,497
Huh? No no no no no.,S04E03,498
It's worth another look.,S04E03,499
"There's nuance, subtlety, there's",S04E03,500
Peek-a-boo.,S04E03,501
I see you.,S04E03,502
"Oh, Aah!",S04E03,503
"Hey, girls. Whatcha you doing?",S04E13,0
Oh we're making a list of all the fun things,S04E13,1
we want to do together before we go to college.,S04E13,2
Kind of like a bucket list,S04E13,3
"except instead of dying, we're graduating.",S04E13,4
"Oh okay. Well, what do you have so far?",S04E13,5
The word List.,S04E13,6
I came up with that.,S04E13,7
I have the perfect idea for you girls.,S04E13,8
How about you take a ride in a hot-air balloon?,S04E13,9
"Ooh, that sounds good.",S04E13,10
Yup.,S04E13,11
"Then again, I am afraid of heights.",S04E13,12
And I'm not crazy about balloons.,S04E13,13
"Okay, how about watching the sunrise from the top of Pike's Peak.",S04E13,14
"Oh, I've always wanted to do that.",S04E13,15
Of course we'd have to get up pretty early.,S04E13,16
And I bet it's cold up there.,S04E13,17
"0 for 2, ma.",S04E13,18
"Okay, why don't you two come up with something?",S04E13,19
Road trip.,S04E13,20
Road trip.,S04E13,21
That's sounds like fun.,S04E13,22
Done.,S04E13,23
- Take a break? - Take a break.,S04E13,24
Today's all burnt toast{\i0},S04E13,25
Running late and dad jokes.{\i0},S04E13,26
Has anybody seen my left shoe?{\i0},S04E13,27
"I close my eyes, take a bite{\i0}",S04E13,28
"Grab a ride, laugh out loud.{\i0}",S04E13,29
There it is up on the roof.{\i0},S04E13,30
"I've been there, I survived.{\i0}",S04E13,31
So just take my advice.{\i0},S04E13,32
"Hang in there, baby{\i0}",S04E13,33
Things are crazy.{\i0},S04E13,34
But I know your future's bright.{\i0},S04E13,35
"Hang in there, baby,{\i0}",S04E13,36
There's no maybe.{\i0},S04E13,37
Everything turns out all right.{\i0},S04E13,38
Sure life is up and down.{\i0},S04E13,39
"But trust me, it comes back around.{\i0}",S04E13,40
You're gonna love who you turn out to be.{\i0},S04E13,41
"Hang in there, baby.{\i0}",S04E13,42
"Hey, neighbors.",S04E13,43
To what do we owe the honor?,S04E13,44
We came over because we have some exciting news.,S04E13,45
"Yeah, we're getting married.",S04E13,46
Didn't you two just start dating?,S04E13,47
"At our age, you don't waste time.",S04E13,48
"Wow, well, congratulations and, you know, many happy years.",S04E13,49
"Yeah, hold on.",S04E13,50
"- Hey, listen, R.",S04E13,51
J.,S04E13,52
- P.,S04E13,53
J.,S04E13,54
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.",S04E13,55
I want you to be my best man.,S04E13,56
Me? Why me?,S04E13,57
"Well, because you're my closest friend",S04E13,58
"You know, who's living.",S04E13,59
"Yeah, as you are mine",S04E13,60
Should something terrible happen to all my friends.,S04E13,61
"And, Bob, we'd love it if you would perform the ceremony.",S04E13,62
Me?,S04E13,63
You can be certified online.,S04E13,64
I looked into it.,S04E13,65
Yeah,S04E13,66
We figured you'd be the right,S04E13,67
choice since we're having the wedding in your house.,S04E13,68
Excuse me?,S04E13,69
We wanted to have a destination wedding.,S04E13,70
"Yeah, so we thought Across the street",S04E13,71
Is the perfect destination.,S04E13,72
So what do you say?,S04E13,73
"- Eh, well - Thanks.",S04E13,74
That means an awful lot to us.,S04E13,75
"Thanks, Bob.",S04E13,76
What just happened here?,S04E13,77
I'm not sure.,S04E13,78
We got to stop answering that door.,S04E13,79
"Hey, Charlie.",S04E13,80
- Have you seen Mom? - No.,S04E13,81
Good.,S04E13,82
I see her now.,S04E13,83
"Hey, Mom.",S04E13,84
What's all this?,S04E13,85
"Oh, um, I'm going to go play catch with Jake.",S04E13,86
In a uniform?,S04E13,87
We take catch pretty seriously.,S04E13,88
Are you playing baseball behind my back?,S04E13,89
Not anymore.,S04E13,90
Why would you do that?,S04E13,91
"Because, Mom, every time you watch me play,",S04E13,92
"you yell, you scream, and get totally out of control.",S04E13,93
That doesn't sound like me.,S04E13,94
"Yes, it does.",S04E13,95
I can't believe you're playing secret baseball.,S04E13,96
It's only a secret to you.,S04E13,97
See ya.,S04E13,98
"Charlie, honey, you'd",S04E13,99
"never play a sport behind my back, would you?",S04E13,100
"- No, Mommy.",S04E13,101
- That's my girl.,S04E13,102
"Hey, Charlie, you ready for T-ball practice?",S04E13,103
Hey!,S04E13,104
"Hey, Ivy, what's up?",S04E13,105
"So my dad, he just bought this new R.",S04E13,106
V.,S04E13,107
"Would you mind checking it out,",S04E13,108
make a big deal about how cool it is?,S04E13,109
It would really make his day.,S04E13,110
- T? - Sorry.,S04E13,111
I was just remembering something,S04E13,112
my dad said about not answering the door.,S04E13,113
"Welcome aboard, Teddy.",S04E13,114
I'm Captain Harry and the pilot of this vessel.,S04E13,115
I believe you know my copilot.,S04E13,116
"Ahoy, Teddy.",S04E13,117
"Oh, wow, Mr.",S04E13,118
Wentz.,S04E13,119
This is fantastic.,S04E13,120
"You know, it's a home that has a motor.",S04E13,121
And it's recreational,S04E13,122
But it's also a vehicle.,S04E13,123
And ain't she a beauty?,S04E13,124
"Ivy, give Teddy the tour.",S04E13,125
Sure.,S04E13,126
All right.,S04E13,127
"This is the kitchen, dining room, living room",S04E13,128
You should check out how comfy the seats are.,S04E13,129
Yeah.,S04E13,130
Mm-hmm.,S04E13,131
"Okay, dad.",S04E13,132
Let's go.,S04E13,133
What's going on?,S04E13,134
Remember the road trip we wanted to take?,S04E13,135
We're on it!,S04E13,136
"Okay, boys, your dad is about to become a wedding officiant.",S04E13,137
"Okay, I hope this isn't too complicated.",S04E13,138
Name.,S04E13,139
Email address.,S04E13,140
Ordain me.,S04E13,141
"- I'll get it, dad. - Hey!",S04E13,142
Reverend Bob.,S04E13,143
"Hey, we're here for the bachelor party.",S04E13,144
What bachelor party?,S04E13,145
The one you're throwing.,S04E13,146
You're my best man.,S04E13,147
It's part of the job.,S04E13,148
"Okay, well, come on in.",S04E13,149
This is Arnie.,S04E13,150
We work together at The Post Office.,S04E13,151
I was told there would be food.,S04E13,152
"Okay, well, uh",S04E13,153
You guys go on downstairs and I'll put something together.,S04E13,154
"Hey, come on, Bob.",S04E13,155
- Me? - Yeah.,S04E13,156
Four's a party.,S04E13,157
Three's just sad.,S04E13,158
"Four can be sad, too.",S04E13,159
You ever think my parents might wonder where I am?,S04E13,160
They know exactly where you are.,S04E13,161
Your Mom even packed your bag.,S04E13,162
"You know what? I'm making a new list,",S04E13,163
and you and my Mom are on it.,S04E13,164
"Come on, T, it's gonna be fun.",S04E13,165
"Where are we going, anyway?",S04E13,166
Las Vegas.,S04E13,167
"Oh, I love Vegas!",S04E13,168
"Hey, Mr. Wentz, how long until we get to Las Vegas?",S04E13,169
"Oh, hard to say.",S04E13,170
Depends on how much time we spend at the mystery stop.,S04E13,171
We're making a mystery stop?,S04E13,172
"Oh, I love Harry's mystery stops.",S04E13,173
Sometimes they're better than the final destination.,S04E13,174
"Ooh, I just got tingly!",S04E13,175
Did you girls get tingly?,S04E13,176
We might as well get comfortable.,S04E13,177
She's gonna be tingly for a while.,S04E13,178
"Hey, Mom.",S04E13,179
"Hello, Gabriel.",S04E13,180
How was your baseball game?,S04E13,181
It was great.,S04E13,182
We won 4-1 and I had two hits.,S04E13,183
"Huh, that sounds like something a parent might enjoy seeing.",S04E13,184
"Mom, how long is this gonna go on?",S04E13,185
How long is baseball season?,S04E13,186
"Look, okay, I admit that in the past,",S04E13,187
I may have gotten a little,S04E13,188
Animated.,S04E13,189
But a person can change.,S04E13,190
"Yeah, sure, a person can change, but what about you?",S04E13,191
"Look, if you let me go to your game I promise,",S04E13,192
that I will be so quiet you won't even know that I'm there.,S04E13,193
"What do you think, Toby? Should I trust her?",S04E13,194
No.,S04E13,195
Don't listen to him.,S04E13,196
He's one.,S04E13,197
And yet he's probably right.,S04E13,198
So,S04E13,199
We've played Pinochle.,S04E13,200
Now what do you guys want to do?,S04E13,201
"You tell us, best man.",S04E13,202
He should have planned more activities.,S04E13,203
He's dropping the ball.,S04E13,204
"Just so you know, old guy",S04E13,205
whispering is just like young guy talking.,S04E13,206
Your best man has a lot of tude.,S04E13,207
"Well, I better get upstairs and make some more sandwiches.",S04E13,208
"Uh, you need some help with that?",S04E13,209
"No, you come up with your own excuse.",S04E13,210
So you,S04E13,211
"You guys were postal workers, huh?",S04E13,212
Exterminator.,S04E13,213
He's more boring than the son.,S04E13,214
Right lane ends.,S04E13,215
Watch for falling rocks.,S04E13,216
Are you gonna read every road sign?,S04E13,217
This is how I keep my sanity on these trips.,S04E13,218
Exit 29B.,S04E13,219
This is Mama Bear cruising down the highway,S04E13,220
with a couple of cubbies and,S04E13,221
a hubby-wubby on our way to a mystery stop.,S04E13,222
Come on back.,S04E13,223
This is Mama Bear. Anybody have their ears on?,S04E13,224
Sounds like we got a mud duck.,S04E13,225
"Affirmative to that, hubby-wubby.",S04E13,226
That's C.,S04E13,227
B.,S04E13,228
"Lingo, Teddy.",S04E13,229
What I said was Sounds like he's got a weak signal.,S04E13,230
"And I responded I agree, husband.",S04E13,231
Speed limit; 70.,S04E13,232
"You're not peeking, now are you, Mary Lou?",S04E13,233
Oh no! I wouldn't spoil a mystery stop.,S04E13,234
All right.,S04E13,235
Open your eyes.,S04E13,236
Welcome to the four corners.,S04E13,237
Four corners of what?,S04E13,238
"Ivy, this is the only place in the whole country",S04E13,239
where four states connect at one single point.,S04E13,240
"Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico.",S04E13,241
"Oh, Harry!",S04E13,242
"Oh, you've done it again!",S04E13,243
I know.,S04E13,244
It doesn't get much more exciting than this.,S04E13,245
"Ivy, could I talk to you for a second?",S04E13,246
"Sure, which state would you like to see me in?",S04E13,247
Hey! How are the sandwiches coming?,S04E13,248
Couple more minutes.,S04E13,249
"Hey, Mrs.",S04E13,250
Dobbs.,S04E13,251
What are you doing here?.,S04E13,252
- I have to talk to you. - Is everything okay?,S04E13,253
"Oh, P.",S04E13,254
J.,S04E13,255
", I have to confess a terrible secret.",S04E13,256
"You see, I was married before.",S04E13,257
"Well, that's not that much",S04E13,258
of a secret since your name is Mrs.,S04E13,259
Dobbs.,S04E13,260
- Let me finish.,S04E13,261
- Mm hmm.,S04E13,262
"My first husband did all the cooking,",S04E13,263
so I never learned how.,S04E13,264
But Bert raves about your cooking.,S04E13,265
"That's because I secretly order takeout,",S04E13,266
and then serve it as if I made it myself.,S04E13,267
"Oh, hey, my Mom used to do that",S04E13,268
Back when she still cared.,S04E13,269
I came over because I know you're going to cooking school,S04E13,270
and I was hoping you could teach me a few things.,S04E13,271
"Sure, I'd be glad to give you a few lessons.",S04E13,272
I just hope Bert doesn't see me come over here.,S04E13,273
"Well, if he does",S04E13,274
You just tell him,S04E13,275
I'm teaching you how to tap dance.,S04E13,276
Yeah.,S04E13,277
I'll think of something.,S04E13,278
"Smile, Teddy!",S04E13,279
"Mrs. Wentz, if you want me to smile, you might want to,",S04E13,280
stand in front of the part of me that smiles.,S04E13,281
Got it.,S04E13,282
"Oh, how's the weather in Arizona, Mary Lou?",S04E13,283
"Well, it's sunny and oh, Harry!",S04E13,284
Gotcha!,S04E13,285
"Well, this was",S04E13,286
Can we get going now?,S04E13,287
"Right you are, Ivy.",S04E13,288
"Onto our final destination, Las Vegas, New Mexico.",S04E13,289
"Um, you mean Nevada.",S04E13,290
"Oh, no, no, no, no.",S04E13,291
That Las Vegas has been done to death.,S04E13,292
"We're going to Las Vegas, New Mexico.",S04E13,293
"There's a Las Vegas, New Mexico?",S04E13,294
The original.,S04E13,295
"Uh, I thought we were going to",S04E13,296
"the one with the spas, the pools and the shopping.",S04E13,297
"What's in Las Vegas, New Mexico?",S04E13,298
The rough-rider museum.,S04E13,299
The world's largest cactus.,S04E13,300
"Ivy, did you know about this?",S04E13,301
I don't recall.,S04E13,302
Really?,S04E13,303
Because I'll tell you what I recall.,S04E13,304
"First, you came up with the idea for the road trip,",S04E13,305
then you lured me into the R.,S04E13,306
V.,S04E13,307
",.",S04E13,308
and then you conveniently left out the crucial,S04E13,309
"New Mexico Part about Las Vegas, New Mexico.",S04E13,310
"Ivy, you didn't tell Teddy we were going to New Mexico?",S04E13,311
She didn't tell me we were leaving the driveway.,S04E13,312
"Harry, if Teddy doesn't",S04E13,313
"want to be on this trip, we should go home.",S04E13,314
What?! No Rough Riders?,S04E13,315
No big cactus?,S04E13,316
We can come back another time.,S04E13,317
"Come on, honey.",S04E13,318
"Dad, what are you doing?",S04E13,319
Seeing what it feels like to have my heart broken in four states.,S04E13,320
Why you doing that?,S04E13,321
"Because bases are loaded, and Gabe is up to bat,",S04E13,322
and I promised I'd stay calm.,S04E13,323
- Strike one! - What?!,S04E13,324
Are you out of your ,S04E13,325
Zip code?,S04E13,326
"Because if you are, welcome to the neighborhood.",S04E13,327
Strike two!,S04E13,328
"You stink, ump.",S04E13,329
What? It was Charlie.,S04E13,330
I thought you weren't gonna tell your Mom you were playing.,S04E13,331
"Yeah, I gave it my best shot.",S04E13,332
Strike three!,S04E13,333
What?! Are you kidding me?!,S04E13,334
On what planet is that considered a strike?,S04E13,335
You are the sorriest excuse for an ump I've ever seen!,S04E13,336
You think you can do better?,S04E13,337
- Yeah.,S04E13,338
- Fine.,S04E13,339
I thought you changed.,S04E13,340
I did,S04E13,341
Then I changed back.,S04E13,342
Thank you.,S04E13,343
Now this,S04E13,344
Is what we call a spoon.,S04E13,345
"Say it with me now, Spoon.",S04E13,346
Can we speed this up? The wedding's tomorrow.,S04E13,347
"Hey, what's going on here?",S04E13,348
"A five, six, seven, eight.",S04E13,349
"I came over to give my best man the rings,",S04E13,350
but it seems like there's something going on here.,S04E13,351
"Bert, there's something I have to confess.",S04E13,352
I,S04E13,353
I can't cook.,S04E13,354
You've been lying to me all this time?,S04E13,355
I'm sorry.,S04E13,356
"Well, sorry's not good enough.",S04E13,357

"Oh, I have an idea.",S04E13,361
"That was just the timer, but I do have an idea.",S04E13,362
"Bert, wait.",S04E13,363
"Wait, Bert.",S04E13,364
- You're making a huge mistake.,S04E13,365
- My mind's made up.,S04E13,366
She lied to me and I can't forgive that.,S04E13,367
"Come on, everyone makes mistakes.",S04E13,368
Did she lie? Yes.,S04E13,369
Did that hurt the trust? Yes.,S04E13,370
Am I bad at these kinds of speeches? Yes.,S04E13,371
But but,S04E13,372
"But, Bert, there's a woman in",S04E13,373
there who is learning how to cook just for you.,S04E13,374
Now who else is gonna go to that much trouble to make you happy?,S04E13,375
"That's all I ever wanted, Bert;",S04E13,376
To make you happy.,S04E13,377
You can't cook anything?,S04E13,378
I can boil a hot dog.,S04E13,379
"Well, okay, the wedding's back on.",S04E13,380
T,S04E13,381

different colleges soon and things are gonna change.,S04E13,390
"Well, Ivy, we're always gonna be best friends.",S04E13,391
"I know, but",S04E13,392
It won't be the same.,S04E13,393
I'm gonna miss you so much.,S04E13,394
"I'm gonna miss you too, T.",S04E13,395
"And just so you know,",S04E13,396
everything's more fun when you're around too.,S04E13,397
"This last day was a bad example, but generally speaking.",S04E13,398
"Believe it or not, I'm even gonna miss them.",S04E13,399
"Mama Bear, this is Teddy Bear.",S04E13,400
Come on back.,S04E13,401
"This is Mama Bear, over.",S04E13,402
Teddy Bear would like to do a little flippity-flop,S04E13,403
"on the whole Las Vegas thing, over.",S04E13,404
"Teddy Bear, are you saying what I think you're saying?",S04E13,405

"No, no, no, too low! Downstairs!",S04E13,417
Ball one!,S04E13,418
"You stink, ump.",S04E13,419

"Well, Charlie, I went to Las Vegas",S04E13,423
New Mexico.,S04E13,424
"And I'd tell you all about the trip,",S04E13,425
"but as they say, what happens in Vegas",S04E13,426
Is nothing.,S04E13,427
"But it doesn't matter because I was with my best friend,",S04E13,428
which means we had a lot of fun.,S04E13,429
"Oh, hey, check this out.",S04E13,430
So by the power vested,S04E13,431
in me by the website Five Minute Minister.,S04E13,432

Just another Duncan-family,S04E13,436
living-room wedding between people we barely know.,S04E13,437
"Wish them good luck, Charlie.",S04E13,438
You know what? All this wedding stuff has really got me thinking.,S04E13,439
You and I should go off on that second honeymoon.,S04E13,440
"You know, the one we're always talking about.",S04E13,441
You mean Paris?,S04E13,442
Where else?,S04E13,443
You have got to be kidding me.,S04E13,444
"Paris, Texas?!",S04E13,445
"Oh, yeah.",S04E13,446
What Paris we're you thinking of?,S04E13,447
- The one in France! - Oh!,S04E13,448

This is where it's at.,S04E13,450
"Oh, come on. Who's gonna choose this place over France?",S04E13,451
"Howdy, partners.",S04E13,452
We didn't know that you were such world travelers.,S04E13,453
"Hey if you want to join us, our next stop is Athens.",S04E13,454
- Georgia? - Where else?,S04E13,455
Greece.,S04E13,456
Greece is where else.,S04E13,457
"Oh, no, no, no.",S04E17,0
"Charlie, honey, look.",S04E17,1
"If you do it one strand at a time, it's prettier.",S04E17,2
See?,S04E17,3
Whatever.,S04E17,4
"Forget it, Mom.",S04E17,5
Charlie with tinsel is like Dad with spaghetti.,S04E17,6
Pretty just ain't gonna happen.,S04E17,7
"Yeah, well, you",S04E17,8
This isn't over.,S04E17,9
"Bob, honey, listen",S04E17,10
"I've got a million things to do this week,",S04E17,11
so I need you to take Charlie to see Santa.,S04E17,12
- Sure.  - What did I just say?,S04E17,13
I have no idea.,S04E17,14
"Honey, I'm trying to think of a good comeback for Gabe.",S04E17,15
"Again,",S04E17,16
I need you to take Charlie to see Santa.,S04E17,17
And you have got to find out what present she wants most.,S04E17,18
Okay.,S04E17,19
Got it.,S04E17,20
"Charlie, Santa, present.",S04E17,21
Three words? That's all you heard?,S04E17,22

"Guys, guess what? I just got into NYU!",S04E17,24
"- Hey!  - Oh, honey.",S04E17,25
That's great.,S04E17,26
"- Hey, congratulations!  - How cool.",S04E17,27
What are you guys talking about?,S04E17,28
"Charlie, honey, I know this might be sad",S04E17,29
But Teddy's gonna be going away to college soon.,S04E17,30
Can I have your room?,S04E17,31
"No, honey,",S04E17,32
Mommy's turning it into a recording studio.,S04E17,33
Because she's so sad.,S04E17,34
"So, uh, NYU wants an answer right away.",S04E17,35
And how can I make a decision,S04E17,36
until I've actually seen the place?,S04E17,37
"Teddy honey, it's Christmas time",S04E17,38
we can't just drop everything and take you to New York.,S04E17,39
"Yeah, we're not going to let you fly across country by yourself.",S04E17,40
Too bad there isn't another adult who can go with her.,S04E17,41
- You're an adult.  - I am?,S04E17,42
"Oh, yeah, I guess I am.",S04E17,43
So I can go if PJ goes with me?,S04E17,44
Yeah.,S04E17,45
I guess that would be okay.,S04E17,46
But your job is to keep an eye on her.,S04E17,47
"Oh, and the thing is, the last campus tour",S04E17,48
I can book is on Christmas Eve.,S04E17,49
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!",S04E17,50
You guys are gonna be gone on Christmas Eve?,S04E17,51
"It's okay, we'll be back for Christmas.",S04E17,52
"PJ, you'll make us Christmas Eve dinner before you go, right?",S04E17,53
"You'll do that for us, right?",S04E17,54
"Gabe, honey, don't be ridiculous.",S04E17,55
"Why should he make it, freeze it, thaw it, re-heat it,",S04E17,56
when I can just make Christmas Eve dinner?,S04E17,57
"You'll do that for us, right?",S04E17,58
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, Jessie{\i0}",S04E17,59
Today's all burnt toast{\i0},S04E17,60

"Let them down, down, down{\i0}",S04E17,72
"Hang in there, baby{\i0}",S04E17,73
Things are crazy{\i0},S04E17,74
But I know your future's bright{\i0},S04E17,75

But trust me it comes back around{\i0},S04E17,80
You're gonna love who you turn out to be{\i0},S04E17,81
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, Jessie{\i0}",S04E17,82
Good Luck Jessie: NYC Christmas,S04E17,83
"PJ, where are we going?",S04E17,84
I have to be at NYU in less than an hour.,S04E17,85
To one of the most famous landmarks in the city.,S04E17,86
And here we are.,S04E17,87
A hot dog cart?,S04E17,88
Not just any hot dog cart.,S04E17,89
George's Kraut Dogs.,S04E17,90
"According to online reviews, this is the best in all the city.",S04E17,91
"There was some speculation about a cart down in Chinatown,",S04E17,92
but that was squashed.,S04E17,93
The speculation?,S04E17,94
"No, the cart.",S04E17,95
It got hit by a bus.,S04E17,96
"Oh, my gosh, you must be George.",S04E17,97
"Oh, my gosh, you must be able to read.",S04E17,98
"Two kraut dogs, please.",S04E17,99
"Oh, I don't want kraut on mine.",S04E17,100

"So, let's meet upin, like, three hours.",S04E17,107
Where you gonna be?,S04E17,108
Right here.,S04E17,109

"Ho, ho, ho! And what is your name?",S04E17,125
Charlie.,S04E17,126
And have you been a good girl?,S04E17,127
Eh.,S04E17,128
Your honesty is refreshing.,S04E17,129
What would you like for Christmas?,S04E17,130

Okay.,S04E17,132
"Merry Christmas, Charlie!.",S04E17,133
"Um, okay, so,",S04E17,134
what did you ask Santa for?,S04E17,135
He knows.,S04E17,136
He's Santa.,S04E17,137
"Um, actually, he's just one of Santa's helpers.",S04E17,138
The real Santa is up at the North Pole.,S04E17,139
"So, you can tell me what you asked for.",S04E17,140
It's a secret.,S04E17,141
"Okay, um, hang on a second.",S04E17,142
Stand right here. Okay?,S04E17,143
"Uh, excuse me, Santa?",S04E17,144
"Oh, oh, listen, buddy, there's a weight limit on this ride.",S04E17,145
I'm sorry.,S04E17,146
I wanted to talk to the Santa that was just here.,S04E17,147
He'll be back this afternoon.,S04E17,148
We like to put on fresh pants every couple hours.,S04E17,149
It's my first time on the subway.,S04E17,150
And me without a balloon.,S04E17,151
There's some of that New York humor I've heard so much about.,S04E17,152
Uh-huh.,S04E17,153
It's my first time in the city.,S04E17,154
"Or as you natives call it, The Big Apple.",S04E17,155
"So, you don't have a book or a magazine or",S04E17,156

"Take this all the way to the end of the line,",S04E17,161
"get off, get on another train",S04E17,162
going the opposite direction.,S04E17,163
More of that trademark New York humor?,S04E17,164
Nope.,S04E17,165
You're going the wrong way.,S04E17,166
"You know, George, now that I've been hanging out here for a while",S04E17,167
I have a question.,S04E17,168
They are 67% beef.,S04E17,169
That wasn't the question.,S04E17,170
"Oh, good.",S04E17,171
I was fudging the numbers.,S04E17,172
You're out here for hours.,S04E17,173
What do you do when you have to go to the bathroom?,S04E17,174
"Well, I try not to think about it.",S04E17,175
'Cause if I think about it then I have to go.,S04E17,176
And now I'm thinking about it!,S04E17,177
Watch the cart! I'll be back.,S04E17,178
Wow.,S04E17,179
It's all mine.,S04E17,180
"Oh, and that's hot!",S04E17,181
"Uh, one kraut dog, no kraut.",S04E17,182
Skyler?,S04E17,183
PJ\NPJ?,S04E17,184
Hi.,S04E17,185
What are you doing here?,S04E17,186
Teddy's taking a tour of NYU.,S04E17,187
We're just here for the day.,S04E17,188
And you got a job?,S04E17,189
It's just temporary.,S04E17,190
"- So, how are you?  - Um, great.",S04E17,191
"I'm graduating high school,",S04E17,192
getting ready to go off to college.,S04E17,193
"Wow, good for you.",S04E17,194
"Well, uh, here's your kraut dog, no kraut.",S04E17,195
"- Uh, what do I owe you?  - It's on me.",S04E17,196
It's the least I can do for my ex-girlfriend.,S04E17,197
Thanks.,S04E17,198
"Well, it was good seeing you.",S04E17,199
"Yeah, you, too.",S04E17,200
"Of all the hot dog stands in all the towns, in all the world",S04E17,201
She had to walk up to the one I'm temporarily working at.,S04E17,202
"- Hey, honey.",S04E17,203
How'd it go at the Mall?  - Fine.,S04E17,204
"Okay, what went wrong?",S04E17,205
Okay.,S04E17,206
Okay.,S04E17,207
I didn't find out what Charlie wanted for Christmas.,S04E17,208
"- What?  - Well, she whispered it to Santa.",S04E17,209
And then she wouldn't tell me.,S04E17,210
"Well, did you ever think about asking Santa?",S04E17,211
"I tried to, but by then,",S04E17,212
Wise Guy Santa had replaced Fresh Pants Santa.,S04E17,213
"Honey, it's crazy down there.",S04E17,214
"Okay, as usual, I have to handle it myself.",S04E17,215
I'm just gonna go down there and talk to him.,S04E17,216
They won't let you talk to him unless you got a kid.,S04E17,217
Gabe!,S04E17,218
- What?  - Let's go.,S04E17,219
You're talking to Santa.,S04E17,220
All right.,S04E17,221
"Let me just shave, I'll be right with you.",S04E17,222
Excuse me?,S04E17,223
"Did you, uh, did you catch any of that?",S04E17,224
"Oh, yeah, he said [Mumbling]",S04E17,225
I was wondering what that meant.,S04E17,226
"There is a temporary minor delay, but we're gonna be moving shortly.",S04E17,227
"Whew! Well, that's good news.",S04E17,228
"No, it's bad news.",S04E17,229
Why?,S04E17,230
"You're not from New York, are you?",S04E17,231
No. How did you know?,S04E17,232
'Cause you don't speak subway.,S04E17,233
Temporary minor delay means,S04E17,234
"we're not going anywhere for a long, long time.",S04E17,235
Should be moving shortly means,S04E17,236
I'm not kidding.,S04E17,237
"A long, long time.",S04E17,238
"But if it's not true, then why would they say that?",S04E17,239
"Oh, because he wants everyone to remain calm.",S04E17,240
"Well, it's not working!",S04E17,241
This is not good.,S04E17,242
I need to get to NYU.,S04E17,243
This train needs to start moving,S04E17,244
Now!,S04E17,245
"If you click your heels three times,",S04E17,246
I'm sure we'll be on our way.,S04E17,247
"Hey, I have to get somewhere, too.",S04E17,248
I have a very important audition.,S04E17,249
"Yeah, the difference is, she might actually get into NYU.",S04E17,250
I'm hoping you two know each other.,S04E17,251
Oh.,S04E17,252
"I'm Jessie, this is Zuri.",S04E17,253

Hi.,S04E17,256

"So I have to wait for you to blow the audition,",S04E17,259
"then I have to console you,",S04E17,260
then I get something to eat?,S04E17,261
Yes.,S04E17,262
Same routine as always.,S04E17,263
But I'm hungry now.,S04E17,264
And something smells good.,S04E17,265
What's that?,S04E17,266
Lasagna.,S04E17,267
And it's for a Christmas party I'm going to.,S04E17,268
We could have a party right now!,S04E17,269
Sit.,S04E17,270
"Um, listen, while we're stuck here,",S04E17,271
would you mind running lines with me?,S04E17,272
Why not?,S04E17,273
"Okay, so we're at a very fancy country club,",S04E17,274
and you're having tea with your friends.,S04E17,275
- Cue me in.,S04E17,276
- Okay.,S04E17,277
I've spent all my summers in Southampton.,S04E17,278
The smell of the beach always brings me back to a simpler time.,S04E17,279
"Oh, here's the girl now.",S04E17,280
More tea?,S04E17,281
- That's it?  - Yeah.,S04E17,282
It's not a very big part.,S04E17,283
They never are.,S04E17,284
"Ho, ho, ho! Who's next?",S04E17,285
"Okay,",S04E17,286
let's do this one standing up.,S04E17,287
I think that might be best.,S04E17,288
"Tell me your name, little Man.",S04E17,289
Gabe.,S04E17,290
I want cash.,S04E17,291

Here's a picture of her.,S04E17,295
"Uh, actually, that's a picture of you.",S04E17,296
"Oh, sorry about that.",S04E17,297
Let me just get one of her.,S04E17,298
"That's me. Me, me",S04E17,299
"Oh, here she is.",S04E17,300
With me.,S04E17,301
Do you remember what present she wanted?,S04E17,302
Yeah.,S04E17,303
It was a doll.,S04E17,304
- Are you sure?  - Or a pony.,S04E17,305
"Okay, now I feel like you're just trying to get rid of me.",S04E17,306
It's always a doll or a pony.,S04E17,307
Once in a while you get a kitten or a bike.,S04E17,308
Dolls and ponies those are your mainstays.,S04E17,309
I don't care about that! I want to know what she wanted!,S04E17,310
"It's Christmas Eve! I'm running out of time,",S04E17,311
and I've got to know!,S04E17,312
"Ma'am, you're a little out of control.",S04E17,313
The holidays can do that to people.,S04E17,314
No.,S04E17,315
It's not just the holidays.,S04E17,316
Okay.,S04E17,317
"So, I want Christmas to be perfect.",S04E17,318
Is that so wrong?.,S04E17,319
"Joe, we got another holiday stress case.",S04E17,320
"- Is there a problem? - Yes, there's a problem.",S04E17,321
It's Christmas Eve and everything is falling apart!,S04E17,322
I hear what you're saying.,S04E17,323
"Now, let's go to Candy Cane Village,",S04E17,324
have some nog and talk about our feelings.,S04E17,325
Okay.,S04E17,326
Okay.,S04E17,327
"Yeah, yeah, I think that might be best.",S04E17,328
"Hey, George. What?",S04E17,329
You sold a dog with no kraut.,S04E17,330
I can see it in your face.,S04E17,331
I didn't mean to.,S04E17,332
It was for my ex-girlfriend.,S04E17,333
No exceptions! Everybody gets kraut!,S04E17,334
Except for Mr. Billy Joel!,S04E17,335
Piano Man gets it any way he wants.,S04E17,336
"I'm sorry, when I saw her,",S04E17,337
I realized I hadn't really gotten over her.,S04E17,338
- And did you tell her this?  - No.,S04E17,339
I choked.,S04E17,340
I just let her walk out of my life again.,S04E17,341
"Well, PJ, I think you should find her and tell her how you feel.",S04E17,342
She sounds like a very special girl.,S04E17,343
How am I going to do that?,S04E17,344
We're in the middle of the biggest city in the world.,S04E17,345
"There's got to be, like, 10 million people in the",S04E17,346
"Oh, there she is.",S04E17,347
"- Hi, PJ.  - Look, I'm really glad you came back,",S04E17,348
'cause I got to tell you something.,S04E17,349
"The minute I saw you, I knew I was still crazy about you.",S04E17,350
"That's why I came back, too.",S04E17,351
I just finished talking to the kebab guy around the corner,S04E17,352
"Oh, Ezra? He's my cousin,",S04E17,353
and very wise in the ways of love.,S04E17,354
"He helped me realize that I'm still crazy about you, too.",S04E17,355
- Really?  - Really.,S04E17,356
"Now that I have you back in my life, I'm never gonna let you go.",S04E17,357
"Actually, I have to go.",S04E17,358
My family and I are driving to Maine for Christmas.,S04E17,359
So this is it?,S04E17,360
I'm afraid so.,S04E17,361
"I mean, you'll be in Denver, and I'll be off to college.",S04E17,362
- Where are you going?  - Denver University.,S04E17,363
Will you write me?,S04E17,364
"Oh, every day.",S04E17,365
I think I can help.,S04E17,366
You're going to school in Denver?,S04E17,367
Yeah.,S04E17,368
And you live in Denver.,S04E17,369
Oh!,S04E17,370
"Yes, I'll hold.",S04E17,371
More tea?,S04E17,372
More tea?,S04E17,373
I will trade you one piece of lasagna for a ride on a private jet.,S04E17,374
"That's right, I can make that happen.",S04E17,375
More tea.,S04E17,376
See? Now it sounds like I'm saying Morty.,S04E17,377
Yes.,S04E17,378
Hi.,S04E17,379
"Um, I was supposed to take the tour today at 2:00.",S04E17,380
"But, um, I'm I'm stuck in the subway.",S04E17,381
So Hold on.,S04E17,382
"Excuse me, I'm sorry, but I'm trying to make an important phone call here.",S04E17,383
"Yeah, and I'm practicing my audition.",S04E17,384
So keep it down.,S04E17,385
"Seriously, could you knock it off?",S04E17,386
"More yeah, see! Now\Nyou made me forget my line!",S04E17,387
"Oh, come on! Give me a break! I'm not gonna ask you again!",S04E17,388
"- If you hit that  - Everyone, stop it!",S04E17,389
"Okay, I know we're all stressed out, but are you forgetting it's Christmas Eve?",S04E17,390
Christmas is not about auditions and college tours.,S04E17,391
"It's about peace on Earth, good will towards men.",S04E17,392
I guess what I'm trying to say is,S04E17,393
Hand over that lasagna!,S04E17,394
Zuri's right.,S04E17,395
I'm not handing over anything!,S04E17,396
What are we getting so upset about? It's Christmas.,S04E17,397
"If I don't make it to NYU, maybe it wasn't meant to be.",S04E17,398
Yeah.,S04E17,399
And maybe me getting that part wasn't meant to be.,S04E17,400
You say that every time.,S04E17,401
They don't need to know that!,S04E17,402
"As long as we're stuck here, might as well make the best of it.",S04E17,403
"Yeah, maybe what this car needs is a little Christmas spirit.",S04E17,404
Mr.,S04E17,405
"Steel Drum Man, if you would.",S04E17,406
We wish you a Merry Christmas.,S04E17,407
We wish you a Merry Christmas.,S04E17,408
We wish you a Merry Christmas,S04E17,409
And a happy new year!,S04E17,410
We wish you a Merry Christmas.,S04E17,411
We wish you a Merry Christmas.,S04E17,412
We wish you a Merry Christmas,S04E17,413
And a happy new year!,S04E17,414
"Charlie! Charlie, you won't believe it.",S04E17,415
A special visitor just came down the chimney.,S04E17,416
Hello-ho-ho,S04E17,417
Charlie.,S04E17,418
"Santa, what are you doing here?",S04E17,419
"Well, I get so many requests from kids",S04E17,420
That sometimes I forget what they asked for.,S04E17,421
I'm not 500 years old anymore.,S04E17,422
Ho ho! Ho!,S04E17,423
"Oh, Santa, stick to the script.",S04E17,424
Why don't you come over here and sit on Santa's lap.,S04E17,425
No.,S04E17,426
"Ho, ho! Why not?",S04E17,427
Because you're Daddy.,S04E17,428
"No! No, ho, ho, ho.",S04E17,429
I'm Santa.,S04E17,430
Then why are you wearing Daddy's shoes?,S04E17,431
"Okay, Sweetie.",S04E17,432
You can go now.,S04E17,433
Great!,S04E17,434
Now what?,S04E17,435
"Honey, relax.",S04E17,436
Have some nog,S04E17,437
It's Christmas Eve.,S04E17,438
"She gets to open a present tonight,and we don't know what she wants!",S04E17,439
"Honey, take it easy.",S04E17,440
It's not worth getting all upset about.,S04E17,441
Who are you?,S04E17,442
"Joe, the Elf, he taught me a lot today.",S04E17,443
Did you know that you can't spell self without Elf?,S04E17,444
What does that mean?,S04E17,445
"I don't know, but it really calmed me down.",S04E17,446
"- Hey, PJ.  - Hey, how was NYU?",S04E17,447
Never made it.,S04E17,448
"Long story, I'll tell you later.",S04E17,449
"So, how was your day?",S04E17,450
"Well, I ate a bunch of hot dogs and I got back together with Skyler.",S04E17,451
How did that happen?,S04E17,452
"Well, after the first four, I had to take a nap, then",S04E17,453
Skyler.,S04E17,454
"Oh, right.",S04E17,455
"I'll, tell you on the plane.",S04E17,456
"If you're going to Denver, you're not going to Denver.",S04E17,457
There's a big blizzard over The Rockies.,S04E17,458
The airport is closed.,S04E17,459
"Teddy, what are we gonna do?",S04E17,460
Wait a minute.,S04E17,461
"Uh, I met this girl on the subway and she gave me her number.",S04E17,462
"Hello. Hi, um, I'm Teddy, who is this?",S04E17,463
The Butler?,S04E17,464
We are so staying there.,S04E17,465
Can I open my special present now?,S04E17,466
"Yeah, yeah do, uh, do we have a special present for Charlie?",S04E17,467
The big one!,S04E17,468
Oh.,S04E17,469
Okay.,S04E17,470
Okay.,S04E17,471
Open it.,S04E17,472
A doll house! I told you Santa knew!,S04E17,473
"Honey, how did you know what to get her?",S04E17,474
I was going to ask you the same question.,S04E17,475
- What? If you didn't get it  - No.,S04E17,476
"And I didn't get it, then who?",S04E17,477
Come on.,S04E17,478
It was me.,S04E17,479
"Oh, uh, for a minute there we were thinking it was Santa.",S04E17,480
That's impossible.,S04E17,481
Everybody knows that Santa doesn't come until we're asleep.,S04E17,482
"So, you used your own money to buy Charlie a doll house?",S04E17,483
How did you know?,S04E17,484
She's only been talking about it for a month.,S04E17,485
"And with Teddy and PJ out of the house, I realized I needed to step up and be a",S04E17,486
A good big brother.,S04E17,487
It's a Christmas miracle.,S04E17,488
"Ewe, stop!",S04E17,489
Stop.,S04E17,490
Stop.,S04E17,491
Stop.,S04E17,492
"Hey, Charlie. Well, even though we're not all together for Christmas,",S04E17,493
"I gotta say, it's kind of cool being in New York.",S04E17,494
- It's a pretty magical place.,S04E17,495
- Maybe for you.,S04E17,496
"Hey, it's the lasagna lady.",S04E17,497
- How was the party?  - I didn't go.,S04E17,498
"I traded the lasagna for a jet ride,",S04E17,499
and then she never called me back!,S04E17,500
Tough town.,S04E17,501
"More caviar, please.",S04E17,502
"Oh, not that much, you fool.",S04E17,503
And draw my bath.,S04E17,504
"- PJ, what are you doing?  - Oh, I'm practicing.",S04E17,505
I've never had a Butler before.,S04E17,506
"Well, this should be interesting.",S04E17,507
Bring me my slippers.,S04E17,508
"I know I don't live here, don't you talk back to me.",S04E17,509
"Well, Merry Christmas and wish us all good luck, Charlie.",S04E17,510
What do you think is in here?,S04E17,511
"I don't know, but whatever it is, I'm guessing it's about to throw up.",S04E17,512
"Am I wrong, or is Zuri really pushing her luck with Santa?",S04E17,513
Make sure to hang that one on a sturdy hook.,S04E17,514
Coal is very heavy.,S04E17,515
I can't believe you invited up two complete strangers from off the street.,S04E17,516
No good can come of that.,S04E17,517
That's how I wound up living here.,S04E17,518
Exactly.,S04E17,519
"Hey, it's Christmas Eve! Quit being such a Scrooge!",S04E17,520
"So, what did you get the kids for Christmas?",S04E17,521
I don't know.,S04E17,522
I just put my name on all the gifts you got em.,S04E17,523
"Just for that, you are gonna help me set up a Christmas treasure hunt for them.",S04E17,524
How am I supposed to put my name on that?,S04E17,525
"Hey, guys!",S04E17,526
"Hello, Jessie.",S04E17,527
"Hi, everyone.",S04E17,528
"- This is my brother, PJ.",S04E17,529
- Hey.,S04E17,530
"This is Ravi, Emma, and Luke.",S04E17,531
Welcome to our humble home.,S04E17,532
"I guess in New York, humble means palace towering over the city.",S04E17,533
My parents say thanks again for letting us stay here.,S04E17,534
We feel really bad intruding on your Christmas Eve.,S04E17,535
"Aw, well, we wouldn't want you to feel bad.",S04E17,536
Ignore our Butler.,S04E17,537
Hospitality is not really his thing.,S04E17,538
How odd. Do you also have a Chef who hates to cook?,S04E17,539
Yeah.,S04E17,540
Same guy.,S04E17,541
The kids were actually just about to open their Christmas Eve gifts.,S04E17,542
Has everyone picked out a present?,S04E17,543
"Well, I have now.",S04E17,544
"Luke Ross, trust fund recipient.",S04E17,545
Is he the one you warned me about?,S04E17,546
Mmm-hmm.,S04E17,547
He's the reason we can't have mistletoe anymore.,S04E17,548
What in the silver bells happened here?,S04E17,549
"Okay, who tried to wrap me?",S04E17,550
"Hey, why was I sleeping on the floor?",S04E17,551
And who's playing the piano from the inside?,S04E17,552
Luke?,S04E17,553
Oh! That explains why I dreamed about flossing.,S04E17,554
We've all dreamed about you flossing.,S04E17,555
"Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.",S04E17,556
Ow! Ow! Ow! Yeah!,S04E17,557
What happened to our tree?,S04E17,558
And why am I the only thing under it?,S04E17,559
OMG! All our presents are gone!,S04E17,560
That's weird.,S04E17,561
I've never heard of Santa taking away presents!,S04E17,562
How naughty were you two?,S04E17,563
Guys!,S04E17,564
Remember that cool chemistry set I opened up last night?,S04E17,565
- No.,S04E17,566
- Nerd.,S04E17,567
Neither do I.,S04E17,568
"But I woke up a few minutes ago, and I made some troubling discoveries.",S04E17,569
"Actually, I don't remember anything that",S04E17,570
happened last night after Teddy and PJ got here.,S04E17,571
"Yeah, the last thing I remember is freckles here hitting on me.",S04E17,572
And my last memory is you saying you'd go out with me.,S04E17,573
Worth a try.,S04E17,574
Why can't any of us remember last night?,S04E17,575
"Judging from my notes,",S04E17,576
it appears I mixed a compound which exploded into a toxic vapor.,S04E17,577
That put us to sleep and caused a retroactive memory blackout.,S04E17,578
Sincerest apologies from myself and the Little Edison Toy Company.,S04E17,579
"Okay, um, not to add another problem to the list, but has anyone seen my brother?",S04E17,580
"No, but do you have a sister?",S04E17,581
"It's in there! It's big, it's scary,",S04E17,582
"and when I woke up, it was nibbling on me!",S04E17,583
- The lizard?  - The Butler?,S04E17,584
"Whoa, it's a reindeer!",S04E17,585
I thought it was a moose!,S04E17,586
Nice reindeer.,S04E17,587
Please tell me you're on a break and Santa's on his way to pick you up!,S04E17,588
"Yes, Dad, we're having a great Christmas.",S04E17,589
They even have a reindeer.,S04E17,590
"Right, uh, yeah, of course, a plastic one.",S04E17,591
A real one would be bizarre and frightening.,S04E17,592
"Good boy, Prancer.",S04E17,593
"More like Biter, or Kicker.",S04E17,594
"We looked everywhere, but we could not find any presents.",S04E17,595
Not even socks.,S04E17,596
"At this point, I'd be happy with an acrylic sweater.",S04E17,597
"Santa, if you're listening, I didn't mean that!",S04E17,598
"Okay, we need to figure this out before your parents get home.",S04E17,599
We'll split into two teams.,S04E17,600
"Boys, you sift through the wreckage for anything that",S04E17,601
might help us remember what happened last night.,S04E17,602
"And, as we sift, we will also dust and put away!",S04E17,603
I seriously need to change teams.,S04E17,604
"PJ, you're in charge.",S04E17,605
Really? Cool!,S04E17,606
"Ravi, you're in charge.",S04E17,607
Ugh! I can't believe I have to clean up,S04E17,608
your stupid chemistry set on Christmas.,S04E17,609
"Stop crying over spilled magnesium citrate,",S04E17,610
and help us find some clues about what happened last night!,S04E17,611
"Hey guys, I think I found our first clue!",S04E17,612
Why do you say that?,S04E17,613
"Because this paper says, your first clue.",S04E17,614
Ooh! Dibs on reading it!,S04E17,615
Welcome to your Christmas treasure hunt.,S04E17,616
What a whimsical holiday treat.,S04E17,617
"Sure, it is fun to just get a present, but hunting for it is much more pleasant.",S04E17,618
Someone hid our presents?,S04E17,619
What kind of sicko would do that?,S04E17,620
"Okay, Shawn's heading for the restroom,",S04E17,621
so we've got about five minutes to check last night's security footage.,S04E17,622
He had Taco Queen for breakfast.,S04E17,623
We've got at least 20.,S04E17,624
We need to figure out what happened after you and PJ got here last night.,S04E17,625
"Yeah, and who let a reindeer up unannounced.",S04E17,626
"If you knew our door staff, you wouldn't be surprised by that.",S04E17,627
Just keep looking for the monster who stole our presents!,S04E17,628
"Okay, no reindeer or monsters yet.",S04E17,629
That's a giant Elf.,S04E17,630
"That's no Elf, that's our Butler!",S04E17,631
It was Bertram? I always knew he was part Grinch!,S04E17,632
He's stealing presents from children?,S04E17,633
It does not get any lower than that.,S04E17,634
"Whoa, it looks like he didn't act alone.",S04E17,635
Jessie?,S04E17,636
"Okay, forget about the lowest.",S04E17,637
It's not like anybody died.,S04E17,638
We haven't seen the rest of the tape.,S04E17,639
It was you?,S04E17,640
You stole our presents?,S04E17,641
I don't know why I would,S04E17,642
Oh! Now I remember!,S04E17,643
"I wanted to give you guys a Christmas treasure hunt, so I hid all your presents.",S04E17,644
"Sounds fun, right?",S04E17,645
Not as fun as finding them under the tree!,S04E17,646
"And opening them in our jammies, as Santa intended!",S04E17,647
"Okay, guys, relax.",S04E17,648
We'll just go get the presents.,S04E17,649
"Great, where are they?",S04E17,650
I have no idea.,S04E17,651
"Oh, someone's about to get Jack Frosted up!",S04E17,652
Why didn't you just hide them in the apartment?,S04E17,653
"Yeah, that would have been smarter.",S04E17,654
"Okay, who invited her?",S04E17,655
Let me at her!,S04E17,656
"Zuri, aren't you the same girl who was just on the subway yesterday",S04E17,657
preaching peace on Earth?,S04E17,658
"All I know is, I don't have my presents,",S04E17,659
so I need something to rip open!,S04E17,660
"Okay, guys, calm down!",S04E17,661
Let's just empty our pockets and purses,S04E17,662
and see if anything jogs my memory.,S04E17,663
Nope.,S04E17,664
All I have is my emergency change of jewelry.,S04E17,665
All I've got is my walking around cash.,S04E17,666
"Well, um, I've got nothing,",S04E17,667
but dibs on checking your couch cushions!,S04E17,668
"Okay, ball of lint, certificate for a full-body eucalyptus wrap,",S04E17,669
and a receipt for a locker rental in Central Park.,S04E17,670
I gave you that certificate months ago!,S04E17,671
You're a thief and ungrateful!,S04E17,672
"Well, excuse me for not wanting to spend five hours",S04E17,673
just to smell like a koala snack!,S04E17,674
"Wait, this receipt is dated December 24th.",S04E17,675
For locker number 339 at the skating rink.,S04E17,676
Maybe I put the presents in there!,S04E17,677
Then what are we doing here? Let's go!,S04E17,678
"Um, guys, uh, we're not taking the reindeer with us, right?",S04E17,679
"Of course not, that would be silly.",S04E17,680
"Sean, would you mind watching our dog?",S04E17,681
"Bye, Spot.",S04E17,682
I think he bought it.,S04E17,683
"Oh, there is the 12th clue!",S04E17,684
All right.,S04E17,685
"Now you have come to the glorious stage,",S04E17,686
where the answer is found in the reptile's cage.,S04E17,687
"Oh, reptile! This one's easy.",S04E17,688
Wait! Mrs. Kipling does not like strangers in her,S04E17,689
cage.,S04E17,690
I got I got it!,S04E17,691
"Whew! Wow, there's a lot of unexpected wildlife in this apartment.",S04E17,692
"Okay, final clue.",S04E17,693
"Don't rush off, stop and think.",S04E17,694
Your presents are in a box by the rink.,S04E17,695
It must mean the ice skating rink in Central Park.,S04E17,696
"Yes! Ravi, you're brilliant! Let's go!",S04E17,697
"Oh! Uh, on the way,",S04E17,698
can we stop and pick up a tourniquet and a pint of O-negative?,S04E17,699
Here it is! Locker 339!,S04E17,700
"Okay, I have the combination.",S04E17,701
Balance due 25 cents? Does anyone have a quarter?,S04E17,702
"Here, I have one.",S04E17,703
Okay,S04E17,704
Bertram!,S04E17,705
What are you doing in there?,S04E17,706
Trying to keep my elbow out of my gall bladder!,S04E17,707
"Jessie, last night, you were supposed to come right back for me!",S04E17,708
"- Why didn't you?  - Uh, I have no idea!",S04E17,709
None of us have any memory of last night.,S04E17,710
Must be nice!,S04E17,711
I spent the entire night wedged inside this stinky locker!,S04E17,712
I'll never be able to go to the gym again.,S04E17,713
Again?,S04E17,714
Don't you even start!,S04E17,715
"Wait, why are you trapped in there?",S04E17,716
"Aw, did Santa give you a time-out?",S04E17,717
"Jessie, this is all your fault.",S04E17,718
"The kids were asleep when we left,",S04E17,719
so I don't understand why we had to wear these stupid costumes.,S04E17,720
I just wanted to see if you'd actually put it on.,S04E17,721
Now I have next year's Christmas card!,S04E17,722
"Come on, let's go home.",S04E17,723
"Uh-oh, it's Zuri! What is she doing not in bed?",S04E17,724
Why don't you ask her nanny?,S04E17,725
"Oh, right.",S04E17,726
Just hide! I don't want my Christmas surprise to get spoiled.,S04E17,727
"- Where?  - In there! There! There, there! Go.",S04E17,728
"Go, go, go!",S04E17,729
"Come on, move farther back!",S04E17,730
"I can't! What do you think is back here, Narnia?",S04E17,731
I know Jessie and Bertram are here somewhere.,S04E17,732
I saw them sneak out with all the presents!,S04E17,733
"Okay, we've been wandering around so long,",S04E17,734
I am starting to recognize all the rats.,S04E17,735
Can we please go back home?,S04E17,736
"Hey, I don't know how you roll in that Podunk hill town,",S04E17,737
"but here in New York, we get what's ours.",S04E17,738
"Okay, Denver is not a Podunk hill town.",S04E17,739
"We have a pro football team, and our own omelet!",S04E17,740
"Call me when you have two football teams, and Jay-Z.",S04E17,741
"All right, Bertram, they're all gone, you can come out now.",S04E17,742
Uh-oh.,S04E17,743
What does uh-oh mean?,S04E17,744
"It locked automatically, and I need a quarter to get you out!",S04E17,745
"Go ahead, splurge.",S04E17,746
I'll pay you back.,S04E17,747
I don't have a quarter!,S04E17,748
"Okay, I'll run home to get one, and be right back.",S04E17,749
"Just try to relax, and breathe through this.",S04E17,750
"Oh, thanks.",S04E17,751
"Oh, wait, where did you get this straw?",S04E17,752
From the trash.,S04E17,753
Then you never came back!,S04E17,754
I was stuck in here with a moldy salami sandwich!,S04E17,755
I don't see a sandwich.,S04E17,756
Don't judge me! You didn't live through what I did!,S04E17,757
"Okay, the presents are in one of these lockers!",S04E17,758
"We know, Sherlock.",S04E17,759
"Oh, hello, Bertram.",S04E17,760
Merry Christmas.,S04E17,761
"Aw, you must have followed my Christmas treasure hunt!",S04E17,762
"Indeed we did, and what a delightful romp it was!",S04E17,763
Delightful?,S04E17,764
I was almost eaten by a dragon!,S04E17,765
And the presents aren't even for me!,S04E17,766
My dad always hid my Christmas presents.,S04E17,767
"He said, You never get anything in life without working for it.",S04E17,768
Except presents! That's the whole point!,S04E17,769
"You know, I actually think a Christmas treasure hunt is very inventive.",S04E17,770
"Thank you, Teddy.",S04E17,771
You're from Colorado.,S04E17,772
You think electricity is inventive.,S04E17,773
Zuri! You loved Colorado when we went skiing there last year.,S04E17,774
"Oh, that was Colorado?",S04E17,775
I thought that was Switzerland.,S04E17,776
"Well, in my defense, it's very easy to fall asleep on a private jet.",S04E17,777
You're a very annoying little girl.,S04E17,778
"Bertram, which locker are the presents in?",S04E17,779
"They're in the locker right next to me. The combination is in my pocket, if you'll",S04E17,780
- It's in his pocket! - just help me out of here.,S04E17,781
"- Got it!  - Okay, come on, come on.",S04E17,782
Oh. Wha,S04E17,783
We need a quarter.,S04E17,784
"Sorry, I'm all out.",S04E17,785
"Well, why don't you break one of your hundreds?",S04E17,786
"I have one in my pocket, if you'll just",S04E17,787
- Let me out of here!  - He has a quarter!,S04E17,788
"Kids, be careful!",S04E17,789
I think this might qualify as a mugging.,S04E17,790
Found it!,S04E17,791
Jackpot! Yeah!,S04E17,792
I knew you'd have fun on my treasure hunt!,S04E17,793
"Well, all's well that ends well.",S04E17,794
Get me out of here!,S04E17,795
"You know, now that Bertram explained everything,",S04E17,796
it's all starting to come back to me.,S04E17,797
"Yeah, me, too.",S04E17,798
But I still feel like we're forgetting of something.,S04E17,799
And there it is.,S04E17,800
"Guys, I just found the weirdest thing!",S04E17,801
Second weirdest.,S04E17,802
"Suddenly, Zuri and Teddy",S04E17,803
being wanted for reindeer-napping makes perfect sense.,S04E17,804
"What, so you two stole the reindeer?",S04E17,805
"Huh, there's a sentence I never thought I'd say.",S04E17,806
I don't remember stealing a reindeer!,S04E17,807
But it sounds like something someone from Denver would do.,S04E17,808
"- Zuri, that's enough!  - We don't do that!",S04E17,809
"Maybe a little innocent reindeer-tipping, now and then, but",S04E17,810
It says Prancer was supposed to be a part of,S04E17,811
the charity concert in the park today.,S04E17,812
"You mean, that deer can sing?",S04E17,813
"Oh, you two are going away for life!",S04E17,814
"Jessie, why do we have to confess?",S04E17,815
Why can't we just release Prancer and run?,S04E17,816
"Yeah, for once, I agree with her.",S04E17,817
It's a Christmas miracle.,S04E17,818
Yeah.,S04E17,819
"Aw, look at that sad little pen.",S04E17,820
"Oh, now I remember why we took him!",S04E17,821
"Yeah, yeah, me, too!",S04E17,822
"After we couldn't find you and Bertram last night,",S04E17,823
"we saw Prancer locked up in that prison,",S04E17,824
so I decided to take him home.,S04E17,825
And you went along with that?,S04E17,826
I had a tough choice to make.,S04E17,827
"Either face an angry, snorting beast",S04E17,828
or the reindeer.,S04E17,829
Prancer! Thank goodness!,S04E17,830
Where was he?,S04E17,831
"Uh, weirdest thing. We found him",S04E17,832
- We found him in our building.,S04E17,833
- In the Statue of Liberty.,S04E17,834
Wait a minute.,S04E17,835
You two stole Prancer!,S04E17,836
I'm calling the cops!,S04E17,837
"Okay, okay! We did it.",S04E17,838
"But you wouldn't send three sweet,",S04E17,839
"young girls to jail, would you?",S04E17,840
"Uh, not three! I'm innocent!",S04E17,841
And they're really sorry.,S04E17,842
Sorry won't raise money for the kids.,S04E17,843
Or put toys in their donation bins.,S04E17,844
"But you've got Prancer back now,",S04E17,845
"and you're still having the charity concert, right?",S04E17,846
"Wrong! After Prancer went missing,",S04E17,847
"our singer, Joey Fatone, helped search for him.",S04E17,848
"He was out there all night, calling Prancer's name,",S04E17,849
"and by this morning, he lost his voice.",S04E17,850
And his watch.,S04E17,851
He was mugged.,S04E17,852
"Wow, way to bring down the room.",S04E17,853
She could still call the cops.,S04E17,854
Dial it back.,S04E17,855
"So now the charity event has their reindeer back, but they don't have a singer.",S04E17,856
"Zuri, I am so disappointed in you.",S04E17,857
I can't believe you stole a reindeer without me!,S04E17,858
That was on my bucket list!,S04E17,859
As long as I'm not on it.,S04E17,860
I can't believe we came so close to meeting the Joey Fatone.,S04E17,861
"Guys, the point is,",S04E17,862
"this event was going to help a lot of kids have a happy Christmas,",S04E17,863
and now that's not going to happen.,S04E17,864
And it's all our fault!,S04E17,865
I feel terrible.,S04E17,866
We were so upset when we could not find our presents.,S04E17,867
Imagine how these kids will feel when they do not get any.,S04E17,868
There's got to be something we can do.,S04E17,869
Wait! I just got the greatest idea!,S04E17,870
"You can sing at the charity concert,",S04E17,871
"which will attract a huge crowd of toy-givers,",S04E17,872
thereby saving the day?,S04E17,873
"Actually, I was gonna say we do an emergency bake sale,",S04E17,874
but I like your idea way better!,S04E17,875
"Jessie, thank you so much for offering to sing for the charity.",S04E17,876
"You can sing, right?",S04E17,877
Like a bird.,S04E17,878
And she looks cuter than a partridge in a pear tree!,S04E17,879
Thanks.,S04E17,880
I just wish we had more than three peeps a watchin'.,S04E17,881
"Yeah, it's not the turnout we expected,",S04E17,882
but at least we'll get a few toys.,S04E17,883
More than a few! Look.,S04E17,884
Look at all the presents!,S04E17,885
"Jessie, we thought about what you said,",S04E17,886
and we realized we've only been thinking,S04E17,887
about ourselves this Christmas.,S04E17,888
So we want to donate all of our presents to the toy drive.,S04E17,889
You do?,S04E17,890
That is so sweet of you.,S04E17,891
I am so proud of you guys!,S04E17,892
"Well, we already have so much.",S04E17,893
"And, you know what?",S04E17,894
Not being selfish feels really good.,S04E17,895
"Aw, Luke.",S04E17,896
"Wow, look what was tucked in with these socks!",S04E17,897
An Amazon river cruise and zip-line adventure!,S04E17,898
Still proud.,S04E17,899
"Merry Christmas,everybody!",S04E17,900
"Please welcome the very talented,",S04E17,901
"hopefully,",S04E17,902
Jessie Prescott.,S04E17,903
"Even if she stinks, please donate more toys! Thank you.",S04E17,904
