Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:12,016 --> 00:00:13,485
Morning, Mom.

3
00:00:13,486 --> 00:00:14,615
Eh.

4
00:00:14,616 --> 00:00:15,591
Tough night?

5
00:00:15,592 --> 00:00:19,728
I had to get up three times with the baby
and your Father was absolutely no help.

6
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:21,019
Sure I was.

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,949
Flicking me in the forehead and
saying "baby's crying" is not helpful.

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,975
Honey, if I flicked you in the forehead and
didn't say anything, that'd just be mean.

9
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:34,546
Hey, after breakfast can somebody
watch Toby while I grab a quick shower?

10
00:00:34,547 --> 00:00:35,878
Oh, I can't.

11
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:38,647
I have a maggot-infested rats'
nest that needs my attention.

12
00:00:38,648 --> 00:00:40,138
- Bye.
- Bye.

13
00:00:40,139 --> 00:00:42,751
Sorry, Mom. I'd love to, but
I'm going to the mall with Ivy.

14
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,823
We're gonna shop and look for jobs.

15
00:00:44,824 --> 00:00:47,224
Mostly shop.

16
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,650
See you.

17
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:51,260
And I'm taking Charlie to the park.

18
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:53,023
Oh, maybe you can take Toby with you.

19
00:00:53,024 --> 00:00:54,337
No thank you, Mama.

20
00:00:54,338 --> 00:00:55,614
Hmm.

21
00:00:55,615 --> 00:00:58,135
- Bye.
- Bye.

22
00:00:58,688 --> 00:00:59,790
Gabe?

23
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:02,731
No thank you, Mama.

24
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,678
<i>Today's all burnt toast
running late and Dad jokes.</i>

25
00:01:09,679 --> 00:01:13,007
<i>"Has anybody seen my left shoe?"</i>

26
00:01:13,008 --> 00:01:16,290
<i>I close my eyes, take a bite
grab a ride, laugh out loud.</i>

27
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:19,688
<i>There it is up on the roof.</i>

28
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:22,782
I've been there, I survived.

29
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:26,023
So just take my advice.

30
00:01:26,026 --> 00:01:29,613
<i>Hang in there, baby
things are crazy.</i>

31
00:01:29,614 --> 00:01:32,346
But I know your future's bright.

32
00:01:32,347 --> 00:01:34,351
Hang in there, baby.

33
00:01:34,352 --> 00:01:38,654
<i>There's no maybe everything
turns out all right.</i>

34
00:01:38,655 --> 00:01:41,061
Sure life is up and down.

35
00:01:41,062 --> 00:01:45,014
But trust me, it comes back around.

36
00:01:45,015 --> 00:01:49,695
<i>You're gonna love who
you turn out to be.</i>

37
00:01:50,052 --> 00:01:53,052
<i>Hang in there, baby.</i>

38
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:02,573
Okay, Charlie. Here we go. Have fun.

39
00:02:02,574 --> 00:02:04,896
Not too fast.

40
00:02:04,897 --> 00:02:07,489
Not too fast. She's already
the fastest kid in the park.

41
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,962
If you want to see fast, you should
see my nephew Mason ride his trike.

44
00:02:13,314 --> 00:02:16,346
He's so fast, he doesn't
have time to make friends.

45
00:02:16,347 --> 00:02:20,342
Yeah, well, Charlie's so fast,
that.. That she makes friends,

46
00:02:20,343 --> 00:02:24,845
but then she goes so far, by the time she
comes back they've changed and moved on.

47
00:02:24,846 --> 00:02:28,655
And.. I am really not good at this.

48
00:02:28,656 --> 00:02:30,917
The point is, Mason's faster.

49
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:33,003
No. Charlie's faster.

50
00:02:33,004 --> 00:02:34,763
You know what this reminds me of?

51
00:02:34,764 --> 00:02:36,798
The conversation that we
had before the baby race.

52
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:39,679
Oh. The baby race.

53
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:43,412
Come on, Charlie, you can do it.

54
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,041
Coming down the home stretch,
it's still Mason in the lead!

55
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:50,242
Come on, Charlie. It's now or never!

56
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:58,661
And the winner is Charlie!

57
00:03:07,596 --> 00:03:08,986
Okay.

58
00:03:08,987 --> 00:03:12,338
Charlie may be faster on
her feet, but on wheels?

59
00:03:12,339 --> 00:03:14,410
Mason's the man.

60
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:16,404
Guess there's only one way to find out.

61
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,282
Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

62
00:03:18,283 --> 00:03:19,641
Baby race two.

63
00:03:19,642 --> 00:03:22,822
The empire trikes back!

64
00:03:28,617 --> 00:03:29,651
Hey, Dad.

65
00:03:29,652 --> 00:03:30,741
Hi, Mr. Wentz.

66
00:03:30,742 --> 00:03:33,057
We're going to the mall
to shop and look for jobs..

67
00:03:33,058 --> 00:03:35,664
But mostly shop.

68
00:03:35,665 --> 00:03:37,592
- Wallet's over there.
- How much can I take?

69
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:38,972
Doesn't matter.

70
00:03:38,973 --> 00:03:41,613
Nothing matters.

71
00:03:41,871 --> 00:03:43,665
Ivy, why is your Dad so depressed?

72
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:44,833
I don't know.

73
00:03:44,834 --> 00:03:46,341
I think it might be
something about his job.

74
00:03:46,342 --> 00:03:49,110
- What does he do?
- I don't know.

75
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:54,743
Ivy, you're not going to the mall
without cleaning your room, are you?

76
00:03:54,744 --> 00:03:57,996
Oh, Harry, honey. I don't
know why you're so down.

77
00:03:57,997 --> 00:04:02,437
Show Teddy the award you got last night.

78
00:04:03,896 --> 00:04:05,855
That's The Silver Plungie.

79
00:04:05,856 --> 00:04:10,598
It's in recognition of Harry's 25
years in the plumbing supply business.

80
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:14,207
Oh, congratulations, Mr.
Wentz. That is quite an honor.

81
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:18,439
Well, I think so. It even
has an inscription. See?

82
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,540
It says, "to Harry Wentz,
for 25 years of duty".

83
00:04:24,426 --> 00:04:26,842
Well, that's unfortunate.

84
00:04:26,843 --> 00:04:31,223
Oh, I'm gonna go find a place for it.

85
00:04:31,754 --> 00:04:34,580
Is this all I have to show..

86
00:04:34,581 --> 00:04:37,348
For 25 years of my life?

87
00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:41,246
A plunger that they
spray-painted silver.

88
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:44,187
It's glittery, too.

89
00:04:44,693 --> 00:04:46,556
I used to have dreams.

90
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:48,439
Big dreams.

91
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,865
I wanted to be..

92
00:04:49,866 --> 00:04:51,699
A weatherman.

93
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,360
I wanted to open a restaurant.

94
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:55,562
But..

95
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:58,042
I'm too old for any of that now.

96
00:04:58,043 --> 00:05:01,622
Mr. Wentz, you are never too
old to pursue your dreams.

97
00:05:01,623 --> 00:05:03,645
Oh, Teddy, I don't know.

98
00:05:03,646 --> 00:05:05,880
Have you seen that commercial
for the new fitness centers?

99
00:05:05,881 --> 00:05:07,387
The one with the talking gophers?

100
00:05:07,388 --> 00:05:09,795
Right. The skinny gopher
says to the fat gopher..

101
00:05:09,796 --> 00:05:13,984
"If you want to lose that weight, you
gotta get off your butt and 'gopher' it".

102
00:05:13,985 --> 00:05:15,791
Sure, it's a terrific commercial.

103
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:18,247
But what's your point?

104
00:05:18,248 --> 00:05:20,367
That's what you gotta do, Mr. Wentz.

105
00:05:20,368 --> 00:05:23,431
You gotta follow your
dreams and "gopher" it!

106
00:05:23,432 --> 00:05:24,748
"Gopher" it.

107
00:05:24,749 --> 00:05:27,149
"Gopher" it.

108
00:05:35,845 --> 00:05:37,679
Why are you dressed like that?

109
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,978
Why are you dressed like that?

110
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:42,295
Because I haven't had a
chance to do the laundry.

111
00:05:42,296 --> 00:05:44,382
Believe it or not, this is
your shirt, your Dad's sweats,

112
00:05:44,383 --> 00:05:47,665
and you don't even want to
know whose underwear I have on.

113
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,336
- They're PJ's.
- You don't know that.

114
00:05:49,337 --> 00:05:52,828
I can see Batman's
head on the waistband.

115
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:53,953
What is that smell?

116
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:55,864
That's my new body spray.

117
00:05:55,865 --> 00:05:58,170
Check it out.

118
00:05:58,171 --> 00:06:00,271
"Duude".

119
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,209
With two "U"s.

120
00:06:03,995 --> 00:06:08,495
Body spray for cool dudes ages 12 to 13.

121
00:06:08,941 --> 00:06:10,264
What's all this about?

122
00:06:10,265 --> 00:06:12,365
Nothing.

123
00:06:12,448 --> 00:06:14,818
Oh, and by the way, for
the next couple of days,

124
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:17,618
I'm gonna be working on a project
with a kid from summer school.

125
00:06:17,619 --> 00:06:21,999
Oh, I see. Is this kid
a boy kid or a girl kid?

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,396
I don't remember.

127
00:06:23,397 --> 00:06:25,593
When I'm at school
I'm all about the work.

128
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:27,170
Aw.

129
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:29,342
My little baby has a crush.

130
00:06:29,343 --> 00:06:31,142
Honey, can I give you some advice?

131
00:06:31,143 --> 00:06:35,672
I'm 13 now. I don't need
any help from my Mommy.

132
00:06:35,673 --> 00:06:40,222
That's a direct quote from
the "Duude" commercial.

133
00:06:40,223 --> 00:06:42,091
Get out!

134
00:06:42,092 --> 00:06:44,012
Okay.

135
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,740
I got all dressed up for nothing?

136
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:52,854
Hi, Gabe.

137
00:06:52,855 --> 00:06:55,075
Hi, Jade.

138
00:07:10,378 --> 00:07:14,245
I like hanging out at your house.
It's always so nice and peaceful.

139
00:07:14,246 --> 00:07:17,358
You did what?! Without even asking me?

140
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:19,190
Harry, you come back here!

141
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:21,964
Girls, I have some exciting news.

142
00:07:21,965 --> 00:07:27,820
Your Father quit his job, took our
life savings, and bought a restaurant.

143
00:07:27,821 --> 00:07:32,707
I combined both my passions and created
the world's first weather-themed eatery.

144
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:35,980
Hurricane Harry's Weather Cafe.

145
00:07:35,981 --> 00:07:37,479
And I owe it all to Teddy.

146
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,401
What did I do?

147
00:07:38,402 --> 00:07:40,922
You did this.

148
00:07:42,854 --> 00:07:45,232
And we're all gonna work there.

149
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:46,476
Me? What did I do?

150
00:07:46,477 --> 00:07:48,676
Well, you wanted jobs? Now you got them.

151
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,907
- That's okay, Mr. Wentz..
- Oh, no, no, no, no, Teddy.

152
00:07:50,908 --> 00:07:52,979
You are going to be a part of this, too.

153
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:57,058
Because of you, this family is
taking a ride on the crazy train.

154
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,399
All aboard.

155
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,574
Woo-woo.

156
00:08:11,834 --> 00:08:13,694
Hmm.

157
00:08:15,143 --> 00:08:16,336
Ah.

158
00:08:16,337 --> 00:08:18,257
Okay.

159
00:08:18,521 --> 00:08:22,165
Charlie, I've made some adjustments.
Your trike is now much more aerodynamic.

160
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,489
Where's my bell?

161
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,062
Oh, you don't need a bell,
you'll be in front the whole time.

162
00:08:26,063 --> 00:08:27,507
Right?

163
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,368
Yes.

164
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,587
Well, well, well. You here to back out?

165
00:08:32,588 --> 00:08:36,757
No, I'm here to show you a preview of what
you're gonna see tomorrow after the race.

166
00:08:36,758 --> 00:08:38,016
My victory dance.

167
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,071
Uh! You like that?

168
00:08:40,072 --> 00:08:41,051
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

169
00:08:41,052 --> 00:08:42,131
Well, I got a victory dance, too.

170
00:08:42,132 --> 00:08:44,108
- Where's it at?
- Goes a little something like this.

171
00:08:44,109 --> 00:08:46,925
That's okay, you like this?

172
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,086
Oh, yes.

173
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:57,812
All right, everybody,
we open in five minutes.

174
00:08:57,813 --> 00:08:59,036
Where's Mother nature?

175
00:08:59,037 --> 00:09:01,377
Here I am.

176
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,620
Oh, Mary Lou, you look stunning.

177
00:09:05,621 --> 00:09:07,386
Oh, you know what?

178
00:09:07,387 --> 00:09:10,090
I thought this would be
silly, but I must say..

179
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,031
I do make it work.

180
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:16,002
All right, where are
my special waitresses?

181
00:09:16,003 --> 00:09:17,582
Sunny and Cloudy?

182
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,043
Here we are.

183
00:09:32,298 --> 00:09:34,158
So..

184
00:09:34,716 --> 00:09:38,425
Kind of a bummer having to
go to summer school, right?

185
00:09:38,426 --> 00:09:41,486
I like summer school.

186
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,284
Me too.

187
00:09:44,285 --> 00:09:48,179
When I said bummer, I meant bummer!

188
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:53,075
You can't change the meaning of a
word by just saying it differently.

189
00:09:53,076 --> 00:09:55,116
Bummer.

190
00:09:55,268 --> 00:09:57,128
Um..

191
00:09:57,703 --> 00:10:00,703
I'll be right back.

192
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,896
Hey.

193
00:10:05,096 --> 00:10:07,340
How's it going out there, tiger?

194
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:10,453
Terrible. I keep saying the wrong thing.

195
00:10:10,454 --> 00:10:12,303
Well.

196
00:10:12,304 --> 00:10:17,525
I know how you can win her over
without saying a single word.

197
00:10:17,526 --> 00:10:20,067
The baby? How is he gonna help me?

198
00:10:20,068 --> 00:10:23,890
Once she sees how great
you are with Toby..

199
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:26,587
She is guaranteed to melt.

200
00:10:26,588 --> 00:10:28,508
Now..

201
00:10:28,706 --> 00:10:30,340
Hold him close.

202
00:10:30,341 --> 00:10:33,041
Cradle the head.

203
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:38,811
I hope you're better with
girls than my older brother.

204
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:41,378
Jade, I don't think
you've met my baby brother.

205
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:42,761
This is Toby.

206
00:10:42,762 --> 00:10:46,242
Oh my gosh, he's so cute.

207
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:49,052
And you're so good with him.

208
00:10:49,053 --> 00:10:52,953
The trick is to cradle the head.

209
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,575
Here, have some more rain.

210
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:03,056
That's what we call water.

211
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:07,331
Isn't that fun?

212
00:11:08,777 --> 00:11:13,457
Martin, party of four,
your table is ready.

213
00:11:18,543 --> 00:11:21,605
This is Hurricane Harry
with a special bulletin.

214
00:11:21,606 --> 00:11:25,306
The forecast for the next
few minutes is entertaining.

215
00:11:25,307 --> 00:11:28,028
Ladies and gentlemen,
the musical stylings of..

216
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:31,149
Wentz's Weather Girls.

217
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,837
Hit it.

218
00:11:38,295 --> 00:11:42,304
<i>Hurricane Harry's is the
spot doo-dah, doo-dah.</i>

219
00:11:42,305 --> 00:11:46,048
<i>We serve our dishes cold
and hot all the doo-dah day.</i>

220
00:11:46,049 --> 00:11:48,329
<i>And night!</i>

221
00:11:58,827 --> 00:12:01,947
Wentz's Weather Girls.

222
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:07,996
And they'll be back to do it
again every hour on the hour.

223
00:12:08,108 --> 00:12:13,688
I liked it better when I
didn't know what my Dad did.

224
00:12:18,658 --> 00:12:22,855
Think we're dry enough to go in yet?

225
00:12:22,856 --> 00:12:24,349
Nope.

226
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,990
Still squishing.

227
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,422
Hey.

228
00:12:28,423 --> 00:12:31,147
What hit us during that
last storm? Was that sleet?

229
00:12:31,148 --> 00:12:35,562
No. Kid threw a bowl
of nachos into the fan.

230
00:12:35,563 --> 00:12:37,409
We gotta quit this job.

231
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:41,370
We can't. Your Mom would kill
me and your Dad would be crushed.

232
00:12:41,371 --> 00:12:47,271
Well, if he adds an earthquake
tomorrow, we might actually be crushed.

233
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:51,048
Wait, we can't quit.

234
00:12:51,049 --> 00:12:53,919
But we could get fired.

235
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,437
Yeah.

236
00:12:55,438 --> 00:13:01,078
Ooh, I don't know what you're
thinking, but I like it.

237
00:13:04,831 --> 00:13:07,077
Hey, do you mind if we
take a break for a second?

238
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:07,930
Why?

239
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:11,048
There's just this thing
I do for my baby brother.

240
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:14,088
I share life lessons
and give him advice.

241
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:17,161
I call it a video diary.

242
00:13:17,162 --> 00:13:19,612
That is the sweetest thing ever.

243
00:13:19,613 --> 00:13:22,493
I get that a lot.

244
00:13:22,883 --> 00:13:24,229
Hey, char..

245
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,150
Toby.

246
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:33,793
It's your big brother Gabe here with
another one of my signature video diaries.

247
00:13:33,794 --> 00:13:38,394
Anyway, last night after I tucked
you in and kissed you on your head,

248
00:13:38,395 --> 00:13:40,220
I sang you to sleep with a song.

249
00:13:40,221 --> 00:13:42,409
Oh, can you sing it now?

250
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,450
Please?

251
00:13:44,871 --> 00:13:46,671
Um.

252
00:13:47,114 --> 00:13:50,834
<i>Hush, little Toby go to sleep.</i>

253
00:13:51,235 --> 00:13:55,435
<i>You're already asleep
so stay asleep.</i>

254
00:13:57,056 --> 00:14:00,836
<i>La-la-la la-la-la la-la-la.</i>

255
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,111
<i>Sleep.</i>

256
00:14:04,825 --> 00:14:09,685
<i>Sleepy sleep, sleepy
sleep sleep, sleep, sleep.</i>

257
00:14:12,466 --> 00:14:14,266
Aw.

258
00:14:14,835 --> 00:14:18,804
Well, that's all for
now, so, I'll just say..

259
00:14:18,805 --> 00:14:20,134
Good..

260
00:14:20,135 --> 00:14:22,655
Fortune, Toby.

261
00:14:23,414 --> 00:14:27,014
That's sort of my trademark.

262
00:14:30,448 --> 00:14:32,885
Now, remember, Charlie.
Winning isn't everything.

263
00:14:32,886 --> 00:14:36,966
- It's the only thing.
- Yes. Yes.

264
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,139
Okay, you know that shame you
felt for the last two years?

265
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,516
It ends today.

266
00:14:43,517 --> 00:14:46,595
Or it could get worse
depending on how this goes.

267
00:14:46,596 --> 00:14:47,620
Okay.

268
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:49,911
The race is to that lamppost and back.

269
00:14:49,912 --> 00:14:51,992
First trike to cross
the finish line wins.

270
00:14:51,993 --> 00:14:54,273
Wins what?

271
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:56,984
- Hey, Dad.
- What is going on?

272
00:14:56,985 --> 00:14:58,196
Nothing.

273
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:00,309
We're just hanging out at the park.

274
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:04,344
Then why have the kids
got numbers on them?

275
00:15:04,345 --> 00:15:08,029
Because we're teaching
them their ones and twos.

276
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,988
How many times have we been over this?

277
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:12,834
You cannot race children like horses.

278
00:15:12,835 --> 00:15:15,380
Can we race them like dogs?

279
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,252
You can't race them at all.

280
00:15:18,253 --> 00:15:20,926
All right, kids, come on. Hey,
who wants to go to the playground?

281
00:15:20,927 --> 00:15:23,867
Huh? Okay, come on.

282
00:15:24,095 --> 00:15:25,591
Man!

283
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,204
I was all fired up for a race today.

284
00:15:27,205 --> 00:15:29,725
Yeah, me too.

285
00:15:31,565 --> 00:15:35,825
You know, we could still have a race.

286
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,743
Where's Toby?

287
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:46,412
Dad took him to the park.

288
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:47,646
What?

289
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:50,349
No, no, Jade's about to leave
and I need to make a move.

290
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,710
So make your move.

291
00:15:51,711 --> 00:15:54,753
I don't have a move.

292
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:57,576
I need Toby.. She likes it
when I do nice things for him.

293
00:15:57,577 --> 00:15:59,284
Gabe, I'm leaving.

294
00:15:59,285 --> 00:16:01,205
Wait!

295
00:16:04,094 --> 00:16:05,954
Hey.

296
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,570
So..

297
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:10,431
Um..

298
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,986
Uh..

299
00:16:11,987 --> 00:16:15,252
I was just wondering if..

300
00:16:15,253 --> 00:16:17,317
You wanted to go to a
movie with me sometime?

301
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:18,741
Oh..

302
00:16:18,742 --> 00:16:20,025
Um..

303
00:16:20,026 --> 00:16:22,606
No, thank you.

304
00:16:23,229 --> 00:16:24,747
But I thought you were kinda into me?

305
00:16:24,748 --> 00:16:26,901
Yeah, as a friend but..

306
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,829
I could never date you.

307
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,590
I like bad boys.

308
00:16:32,218 --> 00:16:34,762
Wha.. But I am a bad boy.

309
00:16:34,763 --> 00:16:36,859
I was just kidding about
all that baby stuff.

310
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,662
Gabe, be proud of who you are.

311
00:16:39,663 --> 00:16:43,019
A sweet, sensitive, good boy.

312
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:47,820
No. I'm not. I'm a
total jerk, ask anyone.

313
00:16:47,932 --> 00:16:49,965
Sweetie-pie.

314
00:16:49,966 --> 00:16:52,952
This blanket you knit for the baby is..

315
00:16:52,953 --> 00:16:55,833
Absolutely precious.

316
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,119
Bye, Gabe.

317
00:17:45,193 --> 00:17:47,113
Whoa!

318
00:18:12,556 --> 00:18:15,080
Woo! Yes! Yes!

319
00:18:15,081 --> 00:18:17,421
Watch this!

320
00:18:33,643 --> 00:18:36,918
Well, that brings us to the top of
the hour which means that it's time

321
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:41,899
to give it up again for
Wentz's Weather Girls.

322
00:18:45,173 --> 00:18:46,667
You ready to get fired?

323
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,768
Hit it.

324
00:19:10,714 --> 00:19:12,681
I guess that was a bad idea.

325
00:19:12,682 --> 00:19:15,752
We've ruined everything.

326
00:19:15,753 --> 00:19:19,882
If you have to make some
tough choices, we understand.

327
00:19:19,883 --> 00:19:23,783
And I'm talking about firing us.

328
00:19:25,662 --> 00:19:27,536
That was..

329
00:19:27,537 --> 00:19:29,637
Awesome!

330
00:19:34,805 --> 00:19:36,705
My weather girls.

331
00:19:36,706 --> 00:19:40,846
We are going to be together forever.

332
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:53,770
Well, what do you know.

333
00:19:53,824 --> 00:19:55,608
My boys.

334
00:19:55,609 --> 00:19:56,759
Yeah.

335
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,307
He woke up from his nap
so we're just hanging out.

336
00:19:59,308 --> 00:20:01,108
Oh.

337
00:20:01,731 --> 00:20:04,470
You know who Toby reminds me of?

338
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:05,501
You.

339
00:20:05,502 --> 00:20:08,537
Because he doesn't have a girlfriend?

340
00:20:08,538 --> 00:20:10,338
No.

341
00:20:10,344 --> 00:20:14,622
Because you both have
that sparkle in your eyes.

342
00:20:14,623 --> 00:20:16,612
And that's another thing girls like..

343
00:20:16,613 --> 00:20:18,743
A sparkle.

344
00:20:18,744 --> 00:20:21,144
Thanks, Mom.

345
00:20:21,189 --> 00:20:26,043
Well, since you're watching Toby, you
don't, um, mind if I take a nap, do you?

346
00:20:26,044 --> 00:20:29,824
Well, I.. I guess, but if he..

347
00:20:30,348 --> 00:20:32,208
Mom?

348
00:20:41,403 --> 00:20:43,329
Hey, Toby. Gabe here.

349
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:48,202
So, I want to tell you everything
that I've learned about girls.

350
00:20:48,203 --> 00:20:50,543
That's it.

351
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:54,638
Anyway, if you ever need
any advice in the future..

352
00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:57,175
Wait. What.. What are you doing?

353
00:20:57,176 --> 00:20:59,856
Making a video diary for Toby.

354
00:20:59,857 --> 00:21:01,924
Wha.. That's kind of my thing.

355
00:21:01,925 --> 00:21:03,273
Not any more.

356
00:21:03,274 --> 00:21:05,134
So..

357
00:21:05,996 --> 00:21:10,596
The next time I have a crush on a
girl, wish me good fortune, Toby.

358
00:21:10,597 --> 00:21:14,557
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

359
00:21:14,738 --> 00:21:15,620
Jealous?

360
00:21:15,621 --> 00:21:19,125
What? No. Confused. What does
"good fortune, Toby" even mean?

361
00:21:19,126 --> 00:21:24,264
It means that Toby has the good fortune
not to hear "good luck, Charlie".

362
00:21:24,265 --> 00:21:25,717
Okay, give me my camera.

363
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:26,961
Good fortune, Toby.

364
00:21:26,962 --> 00:21:29,842
Good luck, Charlie.

365
00:21:39,328 --> 00:21:42,078
Woo. What a ride.

366
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:44,380
You know, after a workout like that,

367
00:21:44,381 --> 00:21:47,304
I don't want some kind
of kiddie bubble bath.

368
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:50,209
I'm 12 to 13 now.

369
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:53,495
I want a body spray that
works as hard as I do.

370
00:21:53,496 --> 00:21:56,357
That's why I use "Duude".

371
00:21:56,358 --> 00:22:00,803
Duude, when you don't need
help from your Mommy any more.

372
00:22:00,804 --> 00:22:05,424
Duude, from the makers
of "Guy" and "Bro".

373
00:22:05,474 --> 00:22:06,894
