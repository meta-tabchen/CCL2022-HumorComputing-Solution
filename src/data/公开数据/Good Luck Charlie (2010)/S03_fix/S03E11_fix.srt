Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:10,470
Okay, everybody. Listen up.

3
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:12,381
Now that we have the new baby,

4
00:00:12,382 --> 00:00:15,082
the Duncan's are not going to be
able to do our summer vacation..

5
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:17,603
- Yay!
- Yes!

6
00:00:19,087 --> 00:00:21,734
Like we usually do.

7
00:00:21,735 --> 00:00:26,655
There's always more.
Why is there always more?

8
00:00:26,872 --> 00:00:30,488
So, the plan is to head up to
the mountains for a few days.

9
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:31,656
Dad got a great deal.

10
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:33,597
- Oh, no. This is bad.
- This should be good.

11
00:00:33,598 --> 00:00:38,330
Okay, I know I got a reputation for
finding less than stellar accommodations.

12
00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:39,931
But this time, it's gonna be great.

13
00:00:39,932 --> 00:00:44,195
We're gonna be staying in a
beautiful, rustic cabin on, uh..

14
00:00:44,196 --> 00:00:46,956
Dead Man's Lake.

15
00:00:47,957 --> 00:00:48,785
What was that?

16
00:00:48,786 --> 00:00:50,576
Hmm? Um..

17
00:00:50,577 --> 00:00:53,337
Dead Man's Lake.

18
00:00:53,372 --> 00:00:56,582
Are.. Are you trying
to say Dead Man's Lake?

19
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,964
I'm trying not to, actually.

20
00:00:58,965 --> 00:01:02,165
Oh, come on, you guys. Once you get
past the name, the place is amazing.

21
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:03,274
Dead Man's Lake?

22
00:01:03,275 --> 00:01:07,507
What, are we gonna catch some dead
fish, or hike through some dead trees?

23
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:08,514
Yeah.

24
00:01:08,515 --> 00:01:11,875
Climb on some dead rocks.

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,120
Or live rocks, whatever.

26
00:01:15,793 --> 00:01:18,207
Now that I think about it,
that sounds really nice.

27
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:24,108
And I for one, am looking forward to
spending some quality time with my family.

28
00:01:26,639 --> 00:01:29,039
We made a lot of kids, Bob.

29
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,400
That one turned out good.

30
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,661
Ivy, hi. Okay, so listen up.

31
00:01:34,662 --> 00:01:36,496
Big party at my house this weekend.

32
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:38,665
My family's going away and I'm
going to pretend to be sick.

33
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,222
So get the word out that..

34
00:01:40,223 --> 00:01:45,263
The Duncan family is
going on a summer vacation.

35
00:01:47,062 --> 00:01:49,213
It was Ivy. I was telling
her about the big trip.

36
00:01:49,214 --> 00:01:50,917
Honey, thank you for
what you said in there.

37
00:01:50,918 --> 00:01:52,135
That was very sweet.

38
00:01:52,136 --> 00:01:56,096
Yeah, well, it needed to be said.

39
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:58,485
Are you coming down with something?

40
00:01:58,486 --> 00:01:59,819
Oh, no. It's just a little tickle.

41
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,992
I'm sure I will be fine for the weekend.

44
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:08,873
Oh. There it is again.

45
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:14,949
<i>Today's all burnt toast
running late and Dad jokes.</i>

46
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,182
<i>"Has anybody seen my left shoe?"</i>

47
00:02:18,183 --> 00:02:19,866
<i>I close my eyes, take a bite.</i>

48
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:21,541
<i>Grab a ride, laugh out loud.</i>

49
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:25,130
<i>There it is up on the roof.</i>

50
00:02:25,131 --> 00:02:28,082
<i>I've been there, I survived.</i>

51
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:31,323
<i>So just take my advice.</i>

52
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:34,765
<i>Hang in there, baby
things are crazy.</i>

53
00:02:34,766 --> 00:02:37,662
<i>But I know your future's bright.</i>

54
00:02:37,663 --> 00:02:41,082
<i>Hang in there, baby
there's no maybe.</i>

55
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,932
<i>Everything turns out all right.</i>

56
00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:46,326
<i>Sure life is up and down.</i>

57
00:02:46,327 --> 00:02:50,137
<i>But trust me, it comes back around.</i>

58
00:02:50,138 --> 00:02:54,818
<i>You're gonna love who
you turn out to be.</i>

59
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,200
<i>Hang in there, baby.</i>

60
00:03:04,831 --> 00:03:06,652
Okay.

61
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:09,637
So, I think we have all the essentials.

62
00:03:09,638 --> 00:03:13,186
Water bottles, sun
screen, bug repellant.

63
00:03:13,187 --> 00:03:17,147
Laptop, hand held, game controller.

64
00:03:17,713 --> 00:03:20,887
Guys. We're only going for three days.

65
00:03:20,888 --> 00:03:22,529
Three days?

66
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,915
We're gonna need more games.

67
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,119
Honey, where's Teddy?

68
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,460
Here I am.

69
00:03:29,955 --> 00:03:31,209
Teddy, are you sick?

70
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,530
Yes, and I was so looking forward to..

71
00:03:36,268 --> 00:03:39,467
Family vacation fun time.

72
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:40,727
Oh.

73
00:03:40,728 --> 00:03:42,604
Bob, what are we going
to do? Cancel the trip?

74
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:44,706
Oh, no, no. You guys go.

75
00:03:44,707 --> 00:03:48,576
Ivy can come and stay with me,
and Mrs. Dabney's right next door.

76
00:03:48,577 --> 00:03:50,112
I don't.. I don't know.

77
00:03:50,113 --> 00:03:52,505
Plus, I would hate to get the baby sick.

78
00:03:52,506 --> 00:03:54,029
That's a good point.

79
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,310
Isn't it?

80
00:03:57,369 --> 00:04:00,344
Hey, we can keep an eye on her
with the home monitoring system.

81
00:04:00,345 --> 00:04:01,446
With.. With the..

82
00:04:01,447 --> 00:04:03,724
With the what now?

83
00:04:03,725 --> 00:04:06,756
Last week I did a pest control
job for a home Security company.

84
00:04:06,757 --> 00:04:09,797
They gave me a system for free. Look.

85
00:04:09,798 --> 00:04:13,518
Got a camera right over there.

86
00:04:14,603 --> 00:04:15,737
So it's on all the time?

87
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:16,838
24-7.

88
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,054
So, while we're in the
mountains, we can watch the

89
00:04:19,055 --> 00:04:21,609
feed through Mom's computer.
And keep an eye on you.

90
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,470
Yay.

91
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:28,380
Hey. Guys, come on, let's go!

92
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:30,961
Bye-bye, Toby.

93
00:04:31,554 --> 00:04:33,783
Charlie, honey, the
baby's coming with us.

94
00:04:33,784 --> 00:04:36,004
Oh, nuts.

95
00:04:36,391 --> 00:04:38,626
Um, where did you learn to say that?

96
00:04:38,627 --> 00:04:40,882
Oh, honey, baby needs a change.

97
00:04:40,883 --> 00:04:43,103
Oh, nuts.

98
00:04:48,403 --> 00:04:50,738
So that's it over there, huh?

99
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:51,637
Yup.

100
00:04:51,638 --> 00:04:57,538
Our new Security system, also
known as the party killer 9,000.

101
00:04:59,648 --> 00:05:00,648
Why 9,000?

102
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:04,189
It's funnier with a number.

103
00:05:04,495 --> 00:05:06,535
Is it?

104
00:05:07,753 --> 00:05:09,557
So, will your parents
be able to hear us?

105
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:12,526
No, there's no sound. They'll
just be able to see us.

106
00:05:12,527 --> 00:05:14,414
Then I guess we gotta cancel the party.

107
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:17,535
Wrong. I have a plan.

108
00:05:17,956 --> 00:05:21,256
And he's right on time.

109
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:25,545
Victor. Come on in.

110
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:27,292
Ivy, you know Victor.

111
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:30,444
President of South
High's audio visual club.

112
00:05:30,445 --> 00:05:33,563
Thank you for using my full title.

113
00:05:33,564 --> 00:05:37,460
I don't always get
the respect I deserve.

114
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:38,853
This is your plan?

115
00:05:38,854 --> 00:05:41,614
Victor the loser?

116
00:05:42,658 --> 00:05:45,958
It's pronounced Deleseur.

117
00:05:46,068 --> 00:05:49,851
Victor, I wanted to invite
you to a party tonight.

118
00:05:49,852 --> 00:05:55,087
So, you, uh, finally got rid
of that dumb jock, Spencer?

119
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,817
No. He's just out of town.

120
00:05:56,818 --> 00:05:59,965
Oh, please don't tell him I said that.

121
00:05:59,966 --> 00:06:02,777
Look, Victor. We need
some audio visual help.

122
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:06,290
Do you know anything about cameras?

123
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,582
Do I know anything about cameras?

124
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:12,303
Oh mahn dore tool-ee-ell lay?

125
00:06:12,521 --> 00:06:16,149
Oh, well, that's Elvish for
"from what land do you come"?

126
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,188
Elvish?

127
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:20,628
I slip into it when I'm excited.

128
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:23,074
What I'm trying to say is I
know everything about cameras.

129
00:06:23,075 --> 00:06:26,668
Next time, just say it like that.

130
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:27,669
I'll be right back.

131
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,372
Wh.. Where are you going?

132
00:06:29,373 --> 00:06:35,273
Well, to tell my Mother this wasn't a
trap, and she may proceed back to home.

133
00:06:42,551 --> 00:06:44,411
Wow.

134
00:06:45,788 --> 00:06:47,722
I gotta hand it to you, Dad.

135
00:06:47,723 --> 00:06:49,557
This place is pretty nice.

136
00:06:49,558 --> 00:06:51,905
Oh. Hold that thought.

137
00:06:51,906 --> 00:06:54,546
Spooky portrait.

138
00:06:54,830 --> 00:07:00,730
Who cares about a stupid picture?
I think we can call this a win.

139
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:04,251
Yep. The eyes follow you.

140
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,059
Well, I think it's very nice.

141
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,365
What do you think, Charlie?

142
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:11,186
Why is Toby here?

143
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,253
Okay, you really gotta let that go.

144
00:07:15,254 --> 00:07:16,785
Come on, let's go check out your room.

145
00:07:16,786 --> 00:07:18,946
Come on.

146
00:07:19,091 --> 00:07:21,954
Well, as long as the picture's the
only spooky thing about the place,

147
00:07:21,955 --> 00:07:23,909
I think we're good.

148
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,190
Afternoon..

149
00:07:27,566 --> 00:07:29,257
Who are you?

150
00:07:29,258 --> 00:07:31,939
Name's Willard. I'm the caretaker.

151
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,820
Been working here 30-odd years.

152
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:38,028
And they have been odd.

153
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:41,749
Okay. Well, we're the Duncans.

154
00:07:42,936 --> 00:07:44,276
Um..

155
00:07:44,277 --> 00:07:45,532
We're renting the place.

156
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:49,156
Oh, surprised to hear they're
still renting it out after the..

157
00:07:49,157 --> 00:07:51,203
Incident.

158
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,755
Incident? What incident?

159
00:07:53,756 --> 00:07:55,997
I've said too much.

160
00:07:55,998 --> 00:07:59,032
Could you at least tell me
what kind of incident it was?

161
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:02,453
Happy incident, fun incident?

162
00:08:02,454 --> 00:08:03,997
Well, I'd better be going.

163
00:08:03,998 --> 00:08:07,816
Wait, wait. Before you go, uh, do
you know anything about this guy?

164
00:08:07,817 --> 00:08:09,232
Sure I do.

165
00:08:09,233 --> 00:08:12,687
That's Commodore Elijah T. Deadman.

166
00:08:12,688 --> 00:08:14,590
That's why it's called Dead Man's Lake.

167
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:18,251
- Oh.
- Actually, no relation.

168
00:08:18,738 --> 00:08:21,531
Well, enjoy your stay..

169
00:08:21,532 --> 00:08:23,932
If you can.

170
00:08:24,276 --> 00:08:26,592
If you can? What do you mean if you can?

171
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:28,878
You seem a little tense.

172
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,214
Here.

173
00:08:30,215 --> 00:08:32,915
This might help.

174
00:08:34,152 --> 00:08:38,052
A coupon for dead man's massage?

175
00:08:38,223 --> 00:08:39,732
Unfortunate name.

176
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:42,133
Great value.

177
00:09:02,996 --> 00:09:04,874
Gabe?

178
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,965
- Yeah?
- Stop messing with me.

179
00:09:06,966 --> 00:09:09,849
Stop? I haven't even started.

180
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,407
You made all the drawers pop open.

181
00:09:11,408 --> 00:09:13,533
Why would I do that?

182
00:09:13,534 --> 00:09:16,008
Did the drawers hurt you in any way?

183
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:17,009
No.

184
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,333
Were you humiliated?

185
00:09:19,334 --> 00:09:20,312
No.

186
00:09:20,313 --> 00:09:24,393
Do you know anything about my work?

187
00:09:30,725 --> 00:09:32,359
Okay. Good fake sneeze.

188
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,395
Now check your temperature.

189
00:09:35,396 --> 00:09:38,148
You've got a fever.
Show me some concern!

190
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:39,577
Oh!

191
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:41,144
Aah!

192
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:42,645
Ooh!

193
00:09:42,646 --> 00:09:44,506
Woo!

194
00:09:44,596 --> 00:09:48,508
You're hot. You're not
going to burst into flames.

195
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:50,310
Just trying to make it more interesting.

196
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:52,445
No. We don't want it to be interesting.

197
00:09:52,446 --> 00:09:55,232
We're creating boring
footage of you being sick.

198
00:09:55,233 --> 00:09:57,012
Then I'll insert it into the video feed,

199
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:00,763
and that's what your parents
will see while we're partying.

200
00:10:00,764 --> 00:10:02,914
That's pretty good, Victor.

201
00:10:02,915 --> 00:10:04,958
Excuse me?

202
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,919
That's pretty good, Mr. President.

203
00:10:09,124 --> 00:10:10,944
Okay, Ivy. You're on.

204
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:12,865
Okay.

205
00:10:14,368 --> 00:10:16,603
Now taste it.

206
00:10:16,604 --> 00:10:18,366
Mm!

207
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,266
Mm-mm!

208
00:10:20,267 --> 00:10:23,634
You love the soup, you're
not in love with the soup.

209
00:10:23,635 --> 00:10:25,116
Don't we have enough video?

210
00:10:25,117 --> 00:10:27,277
And cut.

211
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,506
Okay. Question about the party.

212
00:10:30,507 --> 00:10:34,277
What exactly happens at a party?

213
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:36,389
Well, haven't you ever been to one?

214
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,433
Nope.

215
00:10:37,434 --> 00:10:42,662
Although, the meetings of the AV
Club can be quite rambunctious.

216
00:10:42,663 --> 00:10:46,863
One time, Gary's Mother made popcorn!

217
00:10:49,238 --> 00:10:53,560
You know T.. At some point,
we have to ask ourselves..

218
00:10:53,561 --> 00:10:56,261
Is it worth it?

219
00:11:05,235 --> 00:11:07,601
Charlie, you caught a fish!

220
00:11:07,602 --> 00:11:10,362
This is Daddy's.

221
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,860
That one's mine.

222
00:11:16,464 --> 00:11:17,752
She's confused.

223
00:11:17,753 --> 00:11:20,273
No, I'm not.

224
00:11:20,753 --> 00:11:21,852
Okay.

225
00:11:21,853 --> 00:11:25,933
Why don't you run along now, okay?

226
00:11:26,507 --> 00:11:28,475
So, what you been up to, hon?

227
00:11:28,476 --> 00:11:32,612
Well, Toby's in the middle of a long
nap, and I have been enjoying this novel.

228
00:11:32,613 --> 00:11:35,482
Breathless Eternity?

229
00:11:35,483 --> 00:11:37,046
What's that about?

230
00:11:37,047 --> 00:11:40,932
Some hunky guy who lost his shirt.

231
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,528
So, how's Teddy been doing?

232
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:45,229
Let's find out.

233
00:11:48,882 --> 00:11:50,563
Oh, poor girl.

234
00:11:50,564 --> 00:11:53,504
She looks miserable.

235
00:11:54,686 --> 00:11:56,578
Yeah, uh-huh!

236
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:58,809
Woo! Yeah!

237
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:02,890
Yeah! I feel like Victor da winner!

238
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:26,738
What are you doing?

239
00:12:26,739 --> 00:12:28,133
Putting two and two together.

240
00:12:28,134 --> 00:12:32,034
How long you been working on it?

241
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:38,316
The spooky portrait, the drawers that
open by themselves, the freaky caretaker..

242
00:12:38,317 --> 00:12:43,826
Don't laugh at me, but I
think this house is haunted.

243
00:12:43,827 --> 00:12:46,811
Dude! I said don't laugh at me.

244
00:12:46,812 --> 00:12:48,971
That wasn't me.

245
00:12:48,972 --> 00:12:52,788
When I laugh at you,
it sounds like this.

246
00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:53,813
Right?

247
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,297
So who was that?

248
00:12:55,298 --> 00:12:57,390
I.. I don't know.

249
00:12:57,391 --> 00:12:58,789
Maybe it's just the wind.

250
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,778
All right? Hey, you know what
will make you feel better?

251
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,261
If we build a nice, cheerful fire.

252
00:13:03,262 --> 00:13:05,632
Fire's good. Fire will
ward off evil spirits.

253
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:09,833
- Right.
- Plus we can make S'mores.

254
00:13:10,115 --> 00:13:12,301
Hey, hand me that old newspaper.

255
00:13:12,302 --> 00:13:13,481
Look at this.

256
00:13:13,482 --> 00:13:16,267
"Murders at local house".

257
00:13:16,268 --> 00:13:18,353
It's.. It's.. It's this house.

258
00:13:18,354 --> 00:13:21,594
There were murders here.

259
00:13:22,775 --> 00:13:25,107
Give me that.

260
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:26,979
"The Sheriff made a
gruesome discovery today"

261
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,279
"when the bodies of a vacationing couple"

262
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,281
"were found at a cabin
on Dead Man's Lake".

263
00:13:31,282 --> 00:13:33,646
I knew there was something
wrong with this house.

264
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:34,931
It's a murder house.

265
00:13:34,932 --> 00:13:37,556
Thank you, Dad.

266
00:13:37,557 --> 00:13:38,827
Just calm down.

267
00:13:38,828 --> 00:13:41,414
Just because there was
a murder here before,

268
00:13:41,415 --> 00:13:44,261
doesn't mean there's gonna be more.

269
00:13:44,262 --> 00:13:46,183
Tell him that.

270
00:13:46,184 --> 00:13:47,984
Ah!

271
00:13:51,828 --> 00:13:53,628
Ah!

272
00:13:55,652 --> 00:13:56,901
PJ, Gabe.

273
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:59,842
It knows our names!

274
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,055
It's Dad! The murderer's Dad!

275
00:14:03,056 --> 00:14:06,895
Hey, what the heck
is wrong with you two?

276
00:14:06,896 --> 00:14:08,864
I'm just chopping some firewood.

277
00:14:08,865 --> 00:14:11,175
Dad, there were murders in this house.

278
00:14:11,176 --> 00:14:13,080
- Look at the newspaper.
- Where's the paper?

279
00:14:13,081 --> 00:14:14,316
The newspaper's gone!

280
00:14:14,317 --> 00:14:17,289
The newspaper's.. Oh, there it is.

281
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,814
Would you please calm down?

282
00:14:19,815 --> 00:14:22,617
There is nothing to be afraid of.

283
00:14:22,618 --> 00:14:24,315
- Evening..
- Ah!

284
00:14:24,316 --> 00:14:28,456
Jeez! You've got to stop doing that.

285
00:14:28,457 --> 00:14:32,060
Just came to check and
see if you were still here.

286
00:14:32,061 --> 00:14:33,490
Why wouldn't we be?

287
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:35,489
No reason.

288
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,798
Goodnight, now.

289
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,520
Wait. Do you know anything about this?

290
00:14:39,521 --> 00:14:41,036
The murders?

291
00:14:41,037 --> 00:14:43,678
Yeah. They were never solved.

292
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:48,047
Most people up here
think the killer was..

293
00:14:48,048 --> 00:14:49,758
I've said too much.

294
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:54,783
You never say enough.
Please, finish your sentences.

295
00:14:54,784 --> 00:14:58,120
Some folks think the killer
is the angry spirit of..

296
00:14:58,121 --> 00:15:01,601
Commodore Elijah T. Deadman.

297
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:08,644
Of course other folks
have a different theory.

298
00:15:08,645 --> 00:15:09,945
Okay. What's that?

299
00:15:09,946 --> 00:15:12,526
That it's me.

300
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:26,921
Well, Shaggy and Scooby are convinced
the house is haunted by a killer ghost.

301
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:31,470
Bob, come here. Look at this.

302
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:34,673
Ivy's giving Teddy soup.

303
00:15:34,674 --> 00:15:35,880
So?

304
00:15:35,881 --> 00:15:39,065
So, she's given her soup
three times in the last hour.

305
00:15:39,066 --> 00:15:40,900
It's like it's on a continuous loop.

306
00:15:40,901 --> 00:15:42,496
You think Teddy's up to something?

307
00:15:42,497 --> 00:15:44,313
She's my daughter.

308
00:15:44,314 --> 00:15:46,726
I know she's up to something.

309
00:15:46,727 --> 00:15:52,627
Of course, she's your daughter, too,
so she shouldn't be able to pull it off.

310
00:15:55,156 --> 00:15:57,462
Hey. Teddy's not picking up.

311
00:15:57,463 --> 00:16:01,663
You know what? I have a better idea.

312
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:04,486
Hi, Mrs. Dabney, it's Amy Duncan.

313
00:16:04,487 --> 00:16:07,427
No, don't hang up.

314
00:16:18,182 --> 00:16:20,942
Shh! Guys.. Guys.

315
00:16:33,461 --> 00:16:35,462
Hi, Mrs. Dabney. What's up?

316
00:16:35,463 --> 00:16:37,789
Your Mother called and
asked me to check on you.

317
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,262
Said you were sick.

318
00:16:39,263 --> 00:16:41,063
Oh.

319
00:16:41,088 --> 00:16:43,665
Yeah, I've got a really bad cold.

320
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:47,124
So you put on a party dress?

321
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:50,071
It always cheers me up.

322
00:16:50,072 --> 00:16:52,294
You know what cheers me up?

323
00:16:52,295 --> 00:16:56,555
Busting kids who lie to their parents.

324
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,362
Really? That cheers you up?

325
00:16:58,363 --> 00:17:01,588
We all have our things.

326
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:03,656
Okay, Mrs. Dabney.

327
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:05,243
You got me. What are you gonna do?

328
00:17:05,244 --> 00:17:10,396
Lucky for you, there's one thing
I like more than busting kids.

329
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:13,950
- What's that?
- Getting my party on.

330
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:15,347
Okay, so..

331
00:17:15,348 --> 00:17:19,029
If I invite you to the
party, this stays between us?

332
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,340
You got a deal.

333
00:17:20,341 --> 00:17:21,627
Ah, come on in.

334
00:17:21,628 --> 00:17:24,644
Let me call your Mother and
tell her everything's okay.

335
00:17:24,645 --> 00:17:26,813
Then I'll be back. Oh, one question..

336
00:17:26,814 --> 00:17:29,076
Are kids these days
still doing "The Hustle"?

337
00:17:29,077 --> 00:17:30,113
What's that?

338
00:17:30,114 --> 00:17:33,774
Ooh. You are in for a treat.

339
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:41,861
Well, thank you very much
for checking Mrs. Dabney.

340
00:17:41,862 --> 00:17:46,039
I'm.. I'm sorry to have bothered you.

341
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,777
I don't get it, she said Teddy was
laying on the couch, sick as a dog.

342
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:52,238
That's nice.

343
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:55,854
Hi, Mommy.

344
00:17:56,136 --> 00:17:58,896
May we help you?

345
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,051
Charlie got scared, and
thought it would be a good idea

346
00:18:03,052 --> 00:18:04,717
if we all came and slept with you.

347
00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:07,298
No, I didn't.

348
00:18:09,657 --> 00:18:12,477
She's embarrassed.

349
00:18:13,627 --> 00:18:17,347
Okay, just for a little while.

350
00:18:20,947 --> 00:18:21,979
Hey!

351
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,733
Why do little knees
always find that spot?

352
00:18:24,734 --> 00:18:26,594
Oh..

353
00:18:32,358 --> 00:18:35,098
Is this a great party or what?

354
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:37,453
No, really. I'm asking.

355
00:18:37,454 --> 00:18:40,853
I have no frame of reference.

356
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:42,642
Hey, where's Mrs. Dabney?

357
00:18:42,643 --> 00:18:44,724
I thought she was
supposed to be coming over?

358
00:18:44,725 --> 00:18:49,345
Maybe she couldn't
find something to wear.

359
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:59,609
Where's your turntable?
I'm ready to Boogie!

360
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:09,649
Okay, what was that?

361
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,683
It's the ghost.

362
00:19:10,684 --> 00:19:12,367
- Or the killer.
- Or the killer ghost.

363
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:15,368
Or the ghost killer.

364
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:17,790
Bob, wake up.

365
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:21,271
I'm up! I'm up. I'm up.

366
00:19:24,632 --> 00:19:26,593
Bob.. Bob, turn on the lights.

367
00:19:26,594 --> 00:19:28,980
They don't work.

368
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:30,436
Question.

369
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:35,357
Was that wall dripping
red ooze this afternoon?

370
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:40,250
Follow up question,

371
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:45,972
does anyone else see
the floating candelabra?

372
00:19:45,973 --> 00:19:48,133
Get out!

373
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:50,748
Get out!

374
00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:53,979
Oh!

375
00:19:54,728 --> 00:19:56,648
Whoa!

376
00:19:57,337 --> 00:19:59,565
Last summer it was us.

377
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:02,566
Now it's your turn.

378
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:10,040
He's got a knife!

379
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:13,221
You're all gonna die..

380
00:20:13,811 --> 00:20:18,191
When you learn you're on "Scary House".

381
00:20:20,271 --> 00:20:21,680
What's going on?

382
00:20:21,681 --> 00:20:25,342
"Scary House".. America's
favorite new reality show.

383
00:20:25,343 --> 00:20:28,571
Where we take an average family,
and convince them they're staying

384
00:20:28,572 --> 00:20:31,236
in a haunted house.

385
00:20:31,237 --> 00:20:33,600
This was all a prank?

386
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:35,191
That's terrible.

387
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,668
You made us look like fools.

388
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,924
You people are disgusting.

389
00:20:39,925 --> 00:20:43,765
We're gonna be on TV, you say?

390
00:20:49,483 --> 00:20:51,505
When the Duncans checked
into "Scary House,"

391
00:20:51,506 --> 00:20:55,946
they had no idea what they were in for.

392
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,909
Wow, Mom. That was quite a scream.

393
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:04,790
Yeah, that was PJ.

394
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:08,698
And if you want to see
something really scary,

395
00:21:08,699 --> 00:21:13,679
check out what we saw
on Mama Duncan's laptop.

396
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,030
What was that?

397
00:21:26,621 --> 00:21:27,687
Um..

398
00:21:27,688 --> 00:21:29,455
That is called "The Hustle".

399
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:33,915
It was a very popular
dance move in the 1970s.

400
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,762
And what was it doing
in our living room?

401
00:21:35,763 --> 00:21:38,065
Look, Mom. I don't have
time for all these questions.

402
00:21:38,066 --> 00:21:42,266
Because I have to do my video diary.

403
00:21:42,595 --> 00:21:45,132
Hi, Charlie. Well, we
have had quite a weekend.

404
00:21:45,133 --> 00:21:47,889
But you know what? It's all behind
us now, so why don't we just forget it

405
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,430
and move on with our lives.

406
00:21:51,946 --> 00:21:57,416
Some of us won't be moving on with
anything for the next two weeks.

407
00:21:57,417 --> 00:21:59,090
- Me?
- Yeah.

408
00:21:59,091 --> 00:22:01,791
Can you dig it?

409
00:22:02,699 --> 00:22:06,239
Wish her good luck, Charlie.

410
00:22:10,108 --> 00:22:14,068
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

411
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:19,140
How much longer is this going to go on?

412
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:20,554
What are we going to do?

413
00:22:20,555 --> 00:22:24,695
Well, there's only one thing to do.

414
00:22:29,826 --> 00:22:33,906
Ah! That's it. Get your groove on.

415
00:22:35,575 --> 00:22:37,450
Far out, man.

416
00:22:37,451 --> 00:22:40,031
I can dig it.

417
00:22:42,139 --> 00:22:45,259
- Howdy, folks..
- Oh!

418
00:22:48,193 --> 00:22:51,913
